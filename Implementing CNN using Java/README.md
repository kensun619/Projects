In this project, we implemented a simple convolution nerual network for image classification. The network has two convolution layers and two max pooling layers followed by a fully connected layer.
Provided image data is 128x128 with six categories. There are about 800 images in totoal. After augmentation, we have about 9980 images splited into training, testing and tuning set. Since we are running on CPU, we scale the input image to 32x32. We experimented with different dropout settings and with different number of training data. Confusion matrix is outputed for results.
