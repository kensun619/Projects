Carbondale||2|Michael D Michalisin|Pennsylvania State U., Worthington-Scranton||",,"Supply chain management (SCM) is playing a more central role in helping firms gain and sustain a competitive advantage in todays increasingly demanding business landscape. One of the demands confronting firms and their supply chain members is the deterioration of the earths biosphere and pace at which society is consuming the planets finite resources.  As a result, stakeholders are putting intense pressure on firms to conduct business in ways that promote environmental sustainability.  In todays SCM-intensive business climate, the ability of firms to offer eco-friendly goods and services and do so in environmentally sustainable ways will require the cooperation of the firms supply chain partners, whose requisite activities in generating the needed supplies can significantly affect the cumulative environmental footprint in developing the firms final product.  As a result, there is a growing pressure for firms to integrate more environmentally sound practices into their supply chain activities. Using the logic embodied in the Natural-Resource-Based View (NRBV) of the firm, this paper identifies the types of key resources and capabilities underlying green supply chain management (GSCM) practices for implementing pollution prevention, product stewardship, and sustainable development strategies and then demonstrates why they are capable of possessing the characteristics of strategic assets and distinctive competencies, respectively, and thus sources of sustainable competitive advantage.",natural-resource-based view| green supply chain management| sustained competitive advantage

Three main objectives are addressed: organize the environmental purchasing literature through an assessment of common and unique themes; identify missing themes and opportunities for future research, and suggest new directions for theoretical development. The identified themes across the environmental purchasing research are internal and external integration, risk mitigation, and performance measurement. This paper concentrates on two major gaps to be addressed in future environmental purchasing research: development of environmental performance indicators for supplier environmental performance management, and underdeveloped theory in environmental purchasing research.",environmental purchasing| environmental strategy| supply chain management

Hofstetter|U. of St. Gallen||3|Juliane Rothig|U. of St. Gallen||,,"Public interest on firms' business practices in respect to society and the environment has motivated firms to develop individual statements about their corporate sustainability standards. These statements communicate to the firm's stakeholders that the creation of its products and services remained within the limits of its self-defined sustainability standards.Most firms procure a substantial portion of their value added from third parties, like suppliers, sub-suppliers, or logistics service providers, which are out of the firm's direct control. Nevertheless, external stakeholders such as NGOs, media and consumers hold the focal firm responsible for all practices involved in the making of the product. Suppliers and sub-suppliers not complying with the firm's sustainability standards may damage the firm's reputation, causing considerable revenue losses. However, firm's resources to control their (sub-)suppliers' sustainability compliance are limited.Recent research highlighted the importance of a 'sustainable supplier risk management capability' to enable efficient usage of limited resources by means of identifying, assessing, and controlling sustainability-related risks within the value chain - and the corresponding alignment of compliance management activities such as supplier assessment, development and monitoring.In this paper, we propose a measurement instrument for firm's 'sustainable supplier risk management' capability. It combines the results from a literature review, semi-structured interviews, and two roundtable discussions with academic and industry experts. The proposed items may be tested statistically in the future to serve as basis for quantitative research.",risk management| sustainability| value chains

Newman Award Nominee||,"Lifting economic regulation that guarantees a fair rate-of-return drastically changes the competitive environment of firms. Incumbents may respond to this change by pursuing either cost-leadership or differentiation, e.g. investment in green technology. Using data on US investor-owned electric utility companies from 1992 to 2008, this paper finds that, on average, wholesale electricity deregulation is associated with lower probability of entry into the renewable generation business by incumbents whereas retail electricity deregulation is not significantly related either to entry or to increases in renewables over time. It appears that wholesale deregulation provides greater cost-reducing incentives than retail deregulation. Firms' different responses to wholesale vs. retail deregulation even within the realm of rate-of-return regulation suggest that deregulation might be composed of heterogeneous elements and involve more complexity than previously assumed. Also, the finding that wholesale deregulation has a negative impact on entry but not on changes over time suggests that the effects of deregulation on venturing into a new, although related, business area vs. continuing existing business lines might be different.",deregulation| firm behavior| renewables

Specifically, we predict that firms will be sensitive to regulations in neighboring jurisdictions and in jurisdictions where peer firms operate. By examining the use of renewable generating technologies in the US electrical utility sector between 2001 and 2006, we find evidence of regulatory externalities while controlling for firm capabilities and regulations within the jurisdictions where a firm operates. Firms adopt more renewable power generation when their peers face greater renewable power standards elsewhere. Thus in this sector we find that regulatory externalities constitute a race-to-the-top.",environmental performance| electricity| regulation

However, increasing levels of globalization raise the question of how policies in foreign countries are impacting the decisions of investors in domestic clean technology firms. Analyzing a dataset on venture capital investments to firms working on clean energy, this study finds that trade linkages to foreign countries with more supportive clean energy policy regimes supports domestic investment in clean energy firms. Thus environmental policy at the global level is found to be related to domestic ability to support the transition toward a greener economy.",environmental policy| clean energy| international investment

Denrell|U. of Oxford||2|Balazs Kovacs|U. of Lugano||,,"What are the mechanisms that drive the rise and fall of popularity of cultural objects, phrases, names, and organizational practices? While the answer to this question interests a wide range of sociology, psychology, and management scholars, in this paper we argue that most research in these fields only give a partial answer, as they tend to focus on the rise of cultural practices but rarely analyze their abandonment; and because most research focuses on practices that are or once were popular. Through simulations and the analysis of a dataset that has previously not been used to analyze the rise and fall of cultural practices, the New York Times text archive, we show that studying abandonment and studying a whole range of cultural objects, both popular and less popular, are essential for understanding the mechanisms of the dynamics of popularity. Specifically, we demonstrate that by only focusing on objects and practices that exhibit a fashion like pattern, one can arrive at the erroneous conclusion that increases in popularity beget further increases in popularity. We show that a proper analysis of data indicates the presence of the opposite mechanism whereby rises in popularity inhibit further increase.",diffusion| fads and fashion| popularity
993,,2|Against the Norm: The Diffusion of Commercialized Science in Higher Education,1|Kelly Patterson|Cornell U.||2|W Chad Carlos|Cornell U.||,,"Organizational scholars have long been interested in the study of innovations and how they diffuse over time and space.  Much research suggests that new technologies or practices are initially adopted for technical benefits and as the new practices become commonplace, social forces propel subsequent adoption.  However, initially, the technical merit of innovations is often unclear and unproven.  Furthermore, new practices may not align with existing social expectations and in some instances may even be viewed as socially inappropriate or unacceptable.  In this study, we examine both technological and social factors influencing the spread of an innovative practiceuniversity technology commercialization.  Using data on the adoption of t technology licensing offices by top research universities in the United States, we find that early on, the likelihood of adoption is based primarily on social factors  the prestige and sub-identity of the university.  Later adoption is then tied to technical factors  the revenue potential and financial need of the university.  The results support a social approach to innovation diffusion.  Implications for existing two-stage models of diffusion are discussed.",innovation| diffusion| technology commercialization

Traditionally, divestiture research has adhered to the financial economics perspective of the stock market where shareholders anticipate potential economic benefits gained from an announced corporate action such as divestitures and voice the anticipation of economic gains through their reaction to the announcement. Research on the social context of divestitures has, however, lagged behind. Therefore, in this study I refer to an institutional perspective of the stock market to consider how behavioral aspects can have an influence on market effects.",divestitures| institutional theory| meta-analysis

Our theory proposes that while institutional demands may drive the dissemination of board independence, differences in socio-political factors such as the relative power of the CEO and other board insiders drive firm-level structural elaboration of institutional compliance. Using data from a sample of the largest U.S. corporations from 1981-2007, we illustrate our theory of political-contested structural elaboration by exploring the proliferation of a new board structure: the CEO-only board characterized by the CEO as the sole inside director.  The findings suggest that because institutional demands for board independence provoke shifts in the power and influence of corporate leaders, compliance in the form of CEO-only board structure adoption is not uniformly embraced among board insiders. We find that powerful CEOs are associated with its adoption, while other insiders serve as constraints.  Our study also finds that Sarbanes-Oxley did not have a uniform effect on sources of managerial power, increasing the probability that CEOs with a financial background would assume the CEO-only position and decreasing the likelihood that CFOs would remain on boards.",corporate governance| independent directors| structural elaboration

Yet, negative effects of innovation project failures on employees associated with the projects have been largely neglected in research streams dealing with innovation project failures. Nonetheless, it is vital to maintain or even strengthen the project members innovative functioning in subsequent innovation projects after such setbacks. For this, the concept of resilience, i.e. the ability of project members to bounce back (or even grow) after a setback like a project failure, is fundamental. We develop the second order construct of innovator resilience consisting of self-efficacy, outcome expectancy, optimism, hope, self-esteem, and risk propensity, which is important for project members innovative functioning in innovation projects subsequent to a failure. Additionally, we use the case of a large innovation projects failure to explore characteristics of innovation project terminations affecting innovator resilience.

We propose a model of envy recognition and management that translates the potential harmful effects of envy towards beneficial outcomes for organizational innovation.

A Process Model of Thematic Ideation,1|Julia Katharina Frohlich|Otto Beisheim Graduate School of Management (WHU)||2|Michael Gibbert|U. of Lugano||,,"Similarity recognition plays a fundamental role in managerial cognition as it influences a wide range of managerial activities (e.g. idea generation, creativity, recognition of opportunities and challenges, and knowledge representation and transfer). Management literature so far has mostly defined similarity in terms of taxonomic similarity, in other words two entities are similar to the extent that they share features. In Western cultures this kind of similarity dominates the management literature as well as educational systems. However, recent research in cognitive psychology shows that sharing features is not the only possible basis for similarity. Specifically, thematic similarity  being similar due to the fulfillment of complementary roles in an event or scenario  has been suggested as an important additional basis for similarity. While cognitive science hails thematic similarity as an integral part of human cognition, research on managerial cognition has all but ignored the construct. In our research, we build on cognitive psychology to shed more light on how thematic similarity may help to generate successful thematically driven innovation ideas and further develop its theoretical basis. Building on this, we develop a process model of thematic ideation.",idea generation| similarity| creativity

We propose that negotiation dynamics develop differently in interteam negotiations of equally versus unequally sized teams. Whereas positioning, the statement of outcome preferences early in the process, reduces outcomes for equally-sized teams by inviting compromising behavior, positioning results in higher outcomes for unequally-sized teams by inviting problem-solving behavior. These predictions were supported in an experiment in which negotiation processes were captured through unobtrusive behavioral coding.

We build on two extant theoretical claims that make opposing predictions about the effects of embedded Simmelian friendships on retaliatory initiatives.  The egocentrism hypothesis predicts that Simmelian-tied actors will be least likely to retaliate following a disadvantageous outcome because egocentrism will be lowest in these ties.  In contrast, the symbolic exchange hypothesis predicts that Simmelian-tied actors will be most likely to retaliate following a disadvantageous outcome because the aggrieved party experiences the most drastic loss in value.   The results show that differences in retaliatory initiatives varied across different structures.  In particular, actors were most likely to retaliate following a disadvantageous deal from a Simmelian friend, providing support for the symbolic exchange hypothesis.",social exchange| retaliation| simmelian ties

Gunia|Johns Hopkins U., Carey Business School||",1|Winner of CM Division Best Student Paper Award||2|William H. Newman Award Nominee||,"In the wake of negative organizational events, research directs the involved actors to apologize. However, apologies often communicate two, distinct messages: responsibility (they take blame) and regret (they express remorse). Though theoretically and practically distinguishable, taking blame and expressing remorse, independently, have not received much research attention. This leaves an important gap, as organizational actors often do one without the other. My research focuses on blame-taking, examining its independent incidence and effectiveness after a common event: a failure with multiple causes. Study 1 investigated incidence, asking consultants to reflect on a failure that they had personally experienced. Their responses suggested that blame-taking is rare and confined to leaders and minor failures. Study 2 sampled separate consultants from the same firm; they reacted to someone who took blame or expressed remorse for the Study 1 stories. Notwithstanding its scarcity, blame-taking was roundly rewarded by the Study 2 participants, in comparison to remorse. With a sample of working adults, Study 3 replicated these effects and documented a reason: blame-taking establishes an actors character more than remorse. Overall, this research highlights a potential disconnect between what organizational actors do and what others want them to do. People appear quite reluctant to take blame, even though their counterparts would almost uniformly welcome it.",blame| remorse| apology

Replication is traditionally conceptualized as knowledge transfer between a replicator and a replicatee. Based on an empirical study of two franchising networks we show that replication goes beyond knowledge sharing. More specifically, we identify three micro practices (sensing, practicing and sharing) by which replicatees actively shape local adaptation but also change the formal business format for subsequent cycles of replication. In line with recent research on routines and rules in organizations this also highlights the role of replicatees agentic orientation (local vs. holistic) for whether local adaptation results in the reshaping of the overall business format.",replication| routines| adaptation

It is based on prior studies which elaborated a rules-based perspective on strategy process and on more recent work focused on strategy workshops as an important strategic practice. We use an in-depth study of strategy workshops to develop a typology of three different rule sets: (1) generative rules which bring forth organizational activities, (2) defensive rules which inhibit changes to the generative rules and (3) rules of suspension, i.e. rules for suspending defensive rules. We argue that within strategy workshops it is possible to use rules of suspension as a temporary means of disrupting defensive rules which, in turn, facilitates changes to existing generative rules. The paper makes three contributions to the literature. First, we contribute to the rules-based perspective on strategy process by building a theoretical framework to explain interactions between rule sets during strategy development. Second, we contribute to the literature on strategy-as-practice which is interested in the effects of different strategic practices such as strategy workshops. Third, our micro-level observations add new insight to on-going discussions about the relationship between organizational stability and strategic change.",rules-based perspective| strategy process| strategy workshops

In this paper we focus on negative emotion, specifically anxiety, exploring the often unspoken anxieties surrounding MBA programmes. In contrast to previous work which draws attention to experiences of acute anxiety for a minority of MBA students, our earlier survey work suggested that a majority of MBA students experience moderate anxiety in relation to their programmes. In this paper, we develop understandings of the role of such forms of MBA anxiety, drawing upon interview data.  Our analysis suggests the MBA can usefully be conceptualised as a series of surprises or occasions for sensemaking imbued with anxiety.

Building on theories of emotional labor, we cast employees positive and negative affect at work as crucial moderators. Results obtained in a sample of 245 frontline service employees demonstrate that employees experiencing strong positive affect exhibited high task and contextual performance irrespective of their display rule perceptions. Employees experiencing little positive affect, however, depended on their respective perceptions to attain high performance levels. Further, negative affect moderated the relationship of perceived display rules with task performance (marginally) and one aspect of contextual performance (voluntary learning). Employees experiencing high negative affect scored relatively low on these performance criteria irrespective of their display rule perceptions, whereas such perceptions benefitted the respective criteria for employees experiencing little negative affect.

Accordingly, this study explores whether features of physical workplaces influence employee mood in order to determine how physical environments relate to creativity. A total of 150 full-time employees whose jobs demand creative performance participated in a survey-designed study. Multiple linear regression results indicate that physical environments are positively related to creativity. In addition, the positive mood that people possess in the work context mediates the relationship. The results show the importance of a positive mood as an intermediary between the physical environment and creativity.

Threshold concepts are conceptual gateways, opening up new and previously inaccessible ways of thinking about a field.  In an ethnographic account using participant observation, analysis of student papers, and in-depth interviews, the authors identified two threshold concepts that had a transformational impact on students: (i) situational leadership and (ii) shared leadership.  In addition, they found three modalities that supported the learning of threshold concepts: (i) variation, (ii) enactment, and (iii) reflection.

Affective sensegiving refers to founders attempts to influence stakeholders to develop an understanding of an aspect of the new firm or its founders by displaying founders emotions or seeking to elicit stakeholders emotions. Drawing on data from both founders (about their actions) and stakeholders (about how they made sense of founders actions), we develop the affective sensegiving construct, delineate the boundary conditions of affective sensegiving, and show its differential impact on resource mobilization for start-up organizations. Our study enriches the sensegiving literature by introducing the new construct of affective sensegiving and by theorizing more deeply on the role of affect in sensegiving.

1280,,3|Social Policies and Entrepreneurship: Institutional Foundations of Gender Gaps across 24 Countries,1|Sarah Thebaud|Princeton U.||,,"Across industrialized countries, women are significantly less likely to be engaged in entrepreneurial activity than their male counterparts. Building on theories of entrepreneurship and institutional perspectives on gender inequality in the labor market, this paper develops and tests an institutional theory of gender inequality in entrepreneurship. It is proposed that in countries where social policies effectively integrate women into traditional employment, women are less likely to be pushed into entrepreneurship as a result of work/family conflict. As a result, contexts with such policies are likely to have larger gender gaps in the odds of being engaged in entrepreneurial activity, but smaller gender gaps among established business owners in their motivation for starting a business, orientation toward growth and propensity to innovate. Results from a multilevel analysis of survey data from 24 countries largely support this contention: generous public funding for childcare is associated with larger gender gaps in the odds of being an entrepreneur, but smaller gender gaps in labor market-driven entrepreneurship and the use of new technology. A moderate amount of state-funded leave for mothers is also associated with smaller gender gaps in business size and in the odds of introducing a new product/service to the market.",gender| entrepreneurship| policy

Interestingly, however, the effects are not uniform across types of capital: securing loans is associated with higher survival likelihood but receiving equity investments shortens startup longevity. Accounting for the endogeneity in financing using the Inverse Probability Treatment Weighted (IPTW) estimation reveals that the negative effect of equity capital is largely due to selection.

However, we postulate that the nascence of a firm during the internationalization process and the level of organizational IQ that the firm possesses mitigate the survival benefits of international experience, insofar that they engender competing considerations for internationalization.      We provide empirical support for our propositions by examining the internationalization processes of U.S. dot com start-ups from 1994-2007. Indeed, the model shows that international experience has a positive relationship with survival. However, a high IQ firm would enjoy lesser survival-enhancing benefits, given the possibility that it can become dismissive of new international experiences.

This is the case in new ventures, which typically exhibit low levels of resource quality and quantity. We extend this capability view by analyzing how the experience and the different personality styles of entrepreneurs impact the speed at which substantive and dynamic capabilities are developed in the ventures they create. To measure capabilities, we developed a new instrument based upon insights developed within a new venture over a period of two years of participant observation. We test our hypotheses in a sample of 144 founders of 78 new technology based ventures and found that entrepreneurs with a conscientious personality, and experience in starting a new venture will foster the development of substantive capabilities.

We find that hedge fund managers who previously worked for parent firms located in the industry hubsNew York and Londonoutperform their peers, regardless of the employer quality and where the actual hedge fund is located. We also find that this effect is greater if the entrepreneur worked in a job pre-founding that is highly related to hedge fund management. Our results are robust to controls for selection into job spells in New York/London. The evidence suggests that working in the industrys geographical hub pre-founding increases the nascent entrepreneurs human and social capital which critically imprints the new spawns, and thereby lastingly influences the spawns capabilities and post-founding performance. Further, it also suggests that entrepreneurs who pre-founding worked in a more related job to the new ventures industry are more likely to benefit from the spillover of relevant knowledge and accumulation of relevant social capital in the industry hub pre-founding.

The impact of these major changes can be traced with a matched employer-employee database that provides unusually rich information on the quality of founders and employees associated with the new firms.  Our assessment indicates that the short term consequences of the reform were just as one would predict with a standard economic model of entrepreneurship: The reform resulted in increased firm formation and employment, but mostly among ``marginal firms'' that would have been most readily deterred by existing heavy entry regulations. These marginal firms were typically small, owned by relatively poorly-educated entrepreneurs, operating in the low-tech sector (agriculture, construction, and retail trade).

Using configuration theory, we develop hypotheses examining the nature of the relationships among external triggers, the core elements of CES, and key firm-level outcomes.  Utilizing data from 177 firms, we operationalize key components of the Ireland et al. (2009) model and empirically examine how external fit (among the external environment and key elements of CES) impacts internal fit (among the elements of CES), which then leads to increases in a firms financial and innovative performance. The results demonstrate the importance of organizational alignment (internal fit) for a successful Corporate Entrepreneurship Strategy. In addition, our findings lend credibility to the theoretical model of CES developed by Ireland et al. (2009).",corporate entrepreneurship| entrepreneurial orientation| configuration theory

Therefore, this paper examines the possible impact of partnering strategies Dedicated Biotech Firms carry out in technology licensing agreements by asking: To what extent do DBFs engage in licensing agreements by collaborating with pharmaceutical firms or preventing them to maintain control over IPRs? We test our hypotheses on a sample of 530 US DBFs and 3,281 technology licensing agreements. We found that the number of alliances between biotech companies is higher than that between pharmaceutical and biotech companies. This suggests they, as industry matures, DBFs orchestrate inter-organisational R&D projects through a re-combinative knowledge process avoiding the overwhelming bargain power of pharmaceutical firms. In addition, our findings reveal that small DBFs that ally with pharmaceutical firms obtain fewer patents. This suggests that pharmaceutical firms are able to postpone patenting activity and to capture more value from their alliances with DBFs. In this setting, DBFs can undertake several partnering strategies, depending of their capabilities to retain control over their valuable knowledge. Therefore, technology licensing agreements can be conceived not only as a way to transfer technology but also as a rent appropriation mechanism that weak partners can manage properly via partner selection in order to  protect their core assets through patents. We believe these findings provide new challenges for the management of IPRs and commercialization strategies of technology entrepreneurial ventures.",partner selection| licensing agreements| biotechnology

To examine these two opposite predictions, using 106 U.S. IPOs in 1996 and 1997, I find that founder CEOs are more likely to sell secondary shares at IPO, supporting the rich motive argument. In addition, I find that inside directors play an important role in restricting founder CEOs from selling secondary shares at IPO, which is opposite to the conventional view that inside directors are less effective in monitoring management.

This paper proposes a framework for entrepreneurship research and has three objectives: 1) to advance the recognition of entrepreneurship as a system of sequential, interrelated activities that can be examined by applying concepts of systems theory, which has previously and controversially been used to simplify and clarify complex phenomena; 2) to inject the proposed framework into the scholarly debate on whether and how systems of innovation can and should be managed; and 3) to conceptualize a new dimension of entrepreneurial integration along which different organizational forms may exhibit the described systems attributes with varying degrees of economic success.

Given the vital importance of business model innovation for the survival and growth of companies, it is rather surprising that there is hardly any research devoted to environments of business models. Several valuable concepts have been developed recently to describe and analyze the inner context, i.e. the business model itself; however, to our best knowledge a concept to specify the environmental context of a business model is missing. In this paper we therefore start this endeavour. To answer this question, we conduct a review of the literature on different perspectives on business environments, conduct and analyze interviews with leading experts on these issues, develop a business model environment framework and outline business model innovation opportunities on the interface between a business model and its context.",business model innovation| environment| strategy

Drawing on findings from nine comparative case studies on firm sales in four European countries, we specify different types of firm sales in the family business context. While the sale as an entrepreneurial project and the strategic sale are well planned, hardly afflicted with conflicts and generally result in sellers satisfaction, expropriation is problematic and destructive for the family and the business. We contribute to family business research by showing that the family and the business are intertwined. Their competing logics affect the process and the type of firm sale. Three patterns of firm sale are specified that have different implications for owner families, individual family members, and the family firm.",family business| patterns of firm sale| competing logics

Drawing on the awareness-motivation-capability framework we extend this perspective by proposing that firms actions are influenced by perceived competitive pressure resulting from actions by multiple rivals. Specifically, we predict that firms actions are influenced by the total number of rival actions in the market, and that this effect is moderated by firm type. We test our propositions with data on action magnitude in the German market for mobile telephony and find partial support for our argument.Paper is No Longer Available Online: Please contact the author(s).In this study, we hypothesize and test the effects of competitive advantage and complementarities on a focal firms entry into its rivals markets.  The results suggest that a focal firms entry into a rivals market increases as a focals competitive advantage over a rival and the complementarities across the common markets of a focal and a rival increase.  Also, we find that the joint effect of competitive advantage and complementarities significantly increases the likelihood that a focal firm enters its rivals markets.   Further analyses suggest that competitive advantage and complementarities significantly weaken the forbearance effects of multimarket contact (MMC), and complementarities relative to competitive advantage have a greater effect on a focal firms decision to compete or forbear.  Our study provides first broad empirical evidence on the direct and the joint effects of competitive advantage, complementarities and MMC, and sheds further insights beyond the mutual forbearance effects of MMC.",competitive advantage| complementarities| multimarket contact

A large-scale sample collected from over 1,000 TMT members in 324 Chinese firms was analyzed via the structural equation modeling approach. Research results show that TMT relational capital in the form of trust and cognitive capital in the form of shared vision directly yet structural capital in the form of social interaction density indirectly affect action aggressiveness, which in turn plays a full mediating role between the three aspects of TMT internal social capital and firm performance. Moreover, the three aspects of TMT internal social capital exhibit interdependent relationships. This study advances the theoretical links among the competitive dynamics, the upper echelons, as well as the social capital perspectives by an integrated consideration of the multifaceted socio-cognitive dynamics among TMT members and their implications for firm competition and performance.",competitive dynamics| top management team| social capital

We argue that global product integration is likely to increase as market-seeking and knowledge-seeking motives become more salient, with the former increasing parent to affiliate transfers and the latter increasing affiliate to parent transfers. Within firm global product integration is likely to decline in response to efficiency-seeking investments, however, as firms increasingly use offshore outsourcing to access cheaper inputs and products. Results from a longitudinal within-industry analysis of 32 manufacturing industries from 1989  2004 show support for these arguments. The paper thus sheds new light on the nature of intra-firm cross-border transfers, linking the motives behind international expansion to the way that international operations are organized.",global product integration| fdi motives| offshoring and outsourcing

In addition, the study contributes to the literature by examining performance implications of firms' dynamic development of capabilities based on their accumulated diversification experience. Drawing from the resource-based view of diversification, I conceptualize related within-industry diversification based on the resource overlap of operating units and test performance outcomes using a unique dataset of the world's leading retail firms' unit (i.e., retail format) diversification behavior over thirteen years (from 1997 to 2009). Results show that profits first decrease at low levels of relatedness and then increase at an increasingly higher level as corporate parents focus stronger on related within-industry diversification. Moreover, I find suggestive evidence that unrelated within-industry diversification has a negative effect on profits. In contrast to profits, both related and unrelated within-industry diversification increase a parent firm's sales-based market share in the following year. Finally, the study indicates that especially related diversifiers who exceed a distinct (minimum) level of related within-industry diversification are able to develop capabilities over time that lead to superior firm performance. Specifically, the complementary effects of high degrees of related within-industry diversification in combination with longer experience with related diversification enable corporate parents to outperform competition.",within-industry diversification| synergy creation| capability development

While prior studies suggest that stronger non-compete regimes reduce fluidity in skilled labor markets, far less is known about the added shadows cast by patent enforcement. Building on the entry-deterrence literature, this study develops and tests a model on how an employers reputation for being tough in the enforcement of patents alters the pecuniary benefits associated with retention and, in turn, shapes employee exit decisions. Using a dataset on the US semiconductor industry over a three-decade period, we find that an increase in employer-level litigiousness reduces the likelihood that employee-inventors will leave to join or form rival companies. Consistent with the model, we also find that as employers grow more litigious, the average post-exit productivity of employee-inventors that choose to leave nonetheless increases. Paradoxically, this latter finding suggests that tough reputations more powerfully deter exits by lower quality workers.",employee mobility| patent enforcement| corporate strategy

Our empirical findings confirm this dilemma by demonstrating that TMT board membership has an inverted U-shaped relationship with TMT capabilities to generate rent and a negative relationship with TMT rent appropriation.  We also find that high percentages of TMT directors combined with either a high ratio of founder TMT directors to nonfounder TMT directors, or the presence of venture capitalists can help to resolve the dilemma.",board composition| top management team| human capital

We use socio-cognitive theory to explain how reforms put pressure on board members to step up their monitoring roles, affecting their socio-psychological decision-making processes, and ultimately leading to lower board performance, at least in the short term. Using data from 117 directors in 60 firms we find support for a partial mediation model linking board-level reactions to regulatory reforms, through cohesiveness, to board performance; specifically, increased perceived authority and increased affective conflict are seen to contribute to lower board cohesiveness and lower board performance. Our findings suggest that board effectiveness may be challenged by the unintended consequences of additional monitoring under new regulations.",boards of directors| regulation| conflict

Results indicate that individual directors tenure and director type (his or her functional background, where a distinction is made between insiders and three types of outside directors) enhance strategic renewal. Both relationships are found to be curvilinear (inverted u-shaped). Furthermore, firms can increase their capacity to strategically renew themselves by appointing directors who are connected to other firms by means of outside board seats. The findings reveal that individual directors bring different types of knowledge to the firm and that, subsequently, boards should reflect a diversity of directors in order to grasp their full potential for strategic renewal. In doing so, this study integrates knowledge-based arguments with the under researched resource dependence perspective.",boards| strategic renewal| resource dependence

In this conceptual paper, we contribute to bridging this research gap by integrating the literature on organizational inertia with research on family businesses to explain how family influence affects the reaction of established organizations to technological discontinuities.  Specifically, we propose that family firms adopt the innovation faster than their non-family owned counterparts; however, they take smaller, less aggressive initiatives and they encounter more difficulties in adopting new, non-paradigmatic routines than non-family owned firms.  We also suggest that, when the technology is further emerging, family businesses show more stamina than other companies: that is, they are more willing to continue investing in a new technology, particularly after initial failure.  Finally, we hypothesize that executive personality, particularly the openness to experience of the CEO, moderates the association between family influence and technology adoption.

One subordinate notion of upper echelons theory is that demographic variables of executives can be used as a valid approximation of executives' personalities and thereby serve as a predictor for strategic decision-making.

Drawing on recent advances in research on upper echelons involving the use of core self evaluation to holistically assess the sense of a CEOs self potency, this paper aims at contributing to the explanation of these psychological processes by developing and testing a model linking core self evaluation to individual decision making comprehensiveness and introducing anger as an emotion mediating this relationship. The findings suggest that anger is associated with lower levels of comprehensiveness and that higher levels of core self evaluation are associated negatively with anger and positively with comprehensiveness.

We develop two hypotheses: (1) CEOs!- political liberalism will be positively associated with advances in overall CSR and (2) CEOs!- political liberalism will have stronger influences on advances in social CSR than strategic CSR.  Results of an empirical study of 84 CEOs hired in 2004 show that political liberalism of CEOs is positively related to improvements in CSR, controlling for a number of company and industry-level factors.  The results also demonstrate that CEOs!- political liberalism is more strongly related to advances in strategic CSR, but less strongly to advances in social CSR, which is contrary to our prediction.  We speculate that CEOs have more discretion to manifest their personal values in advancing strategic CSR activities that have clear benefits for shareholders (e.g., employee relations, product quality), but they do not have as much leeway to pursue a social CSR agenda that serves more indirect stakeholders (e.g., human rights, environmental concerns).

Our results highlight the need to recognize the multi-level nature of board oversight through the full board as well as through board committees, and the distinction between board composition and board diligence.

In explaining the variation found in executive compensation, scholars have often focused on firm-specific aspects. Rather than focusing on firm specific aspects such as performance, size or industry, we propose that cultural implications manifested by attribution theory and prestige are useful to explain the variation in CEO compensation. We develop a conceptual framework that explores the impact that prestige and attribution bias have on CEO compensation across borders. We also propose a testable model and conceptual matrix to predict levels of compensation based on levels of prestige and attribution bias.

Using a sample of 236 mergers during 1996 to 2000 in the US, we find that 46% of CEOs of acquiring firms were replaced within 5 years  28% left voluntarily and 18% were forced to step down.  If the acquiring firm kept the target firm's top executives as top executives, the acquiring firm's CEO was more likely to leave.

Moreover, we show that director professional identification attenuates the positive and negative effects of organizational identification on DTP for low-tenured and high-tenured directors respectively.

We analyze a panel data set of US law firms from the period of 1992-1999, using a fuzzy clustering approach to measure the firms affiliation to theoretically derived configurations. The results show that the degree to which firms conform to these complementarity-driven configurations has a significant effect on their performance.",configuration| complementarity| professional service firms

Guided by these literature streams, we conducted an archival case study research of three successful turnaround firms.  A new theoretical framework of corporate turnaround was then developed by linking the insights garnered from the case data with broader literatures of organizational stability and change, threat rigidity, and agency theory.  This framework suggests that firms overall responses to performance decline and financial distress can be classified as stability-dominant or reorientation-dominant.  The effectiveness of these two turnaround approaches is governed by (1) leadership stability, encapsulated in CEO continuity versus change, and (2) turnaround agents unified power and leadership, embodied in CEO duality.  From the proposed framework of corporate turnaround, we then drew two testable hypotheses regarding the two interaction effects, (1) between CEO change and turnaround approach and (2) between CEO duality and turnaround approach, on turnaround outcome.  Finally, we conducted a large-sample study, using 58 successful and unsuccessful turnaround firms (i.e., 29 matched pairs) to test the proposed hypotheses.  The results yielded support for both hypotheses.",corporate turnaround| strategic change| ceo change

CSR and Corporate Reputation Management,1|Jiao Luo|Columbia U.||2|Stephan Meier|Columbia Business School||3|Felix Oberholzer-Gee|Harvard Business School||,,"There are two schools of thought that link corporate reputation and public perceptions of companies.  One camp argues that companies with a solid track record of socially responsible behavior build up a reservoir of goodwill and trust that protects the organization in times of corporate crises.  An alternative view holds that companies with highly visible CSR activities and social aspirations face increased public demands and scrutiny, making it more likely that they will fail in the publicas eye.  In this paper, we test whether the media response to corporate failings varies with an organizationas prior CSR activities and reputation.Our setting is the oil industry.  We compile a unique dataset of oil and chemical spills caused by twenty largest oil companies with operations in the United States.  Between 2001 and 2007, we observe 23,355 such accidents.  In an extensive search of daily U.S. newspapers, we determine the frequency with which the media report oil spills. Consistent with the view that socially more responsible organizations are held to higher standards, we find that the media are more likely to report spills at companies with a better environmental record.  For example, accidents caused by British Petroleum are more likely to be covered than similar accidents at Exxon Mobil.  The relationship between the number of accidents at a particular company and the number of news reports is particularly pronounced for firms with significant green initiatives.  For example, oil companies that invest in clean energy face a greater risk of having accidents covered.  These results are broadly consistent with the view that corporate missteps are particularly newsworthy if they occur at companies with a superior environmental record.  At the same time, we also find that spills at companies with the poorest environmental performance are more likely to find attention.  Past regulatory problems at a company, for instance, increase the likelihood that the press will report an accident.  The asafea position, our research suggests, is for companies to be in the middle of the pack.",csr| corporate failure| environment

This form of governance has been described both as distinctly different from and potentially superior to the traditional public corporation. We review the ways in which Private Equity firm ownership differs and how this difference impacts on the so-called portfolio companies owned.  Drawing on a unique sample of 3229 realized US buyout investments we estimate that, corporate (PE Firm), industry and acquisition year effects all account for significant variance in performance (9.6 percent, 2.1 percent and 4.3 percent R2, respectively). We also observe significant fluctuating industry effects (7.7 percent R2). These results are qualitatively in line with the findings from prior research on the corporate effect, which largely analyzes publicly held, diversified corporations. Our study contributes to an understanding of the ownership effect in the strategy literature more generally by demonstrating that although the nature of the interaction between corporate center (Private Equity firm) and business unit (Portfolio Company) may be very different under Private Equity governance as opposed to traditional public corporations, ultimately the effect of ownership remains significant.",private equity| industry effect| corporate effect

Using a database of 296 firms traded on the Sao Paulo stock exchange between 1995 and 2003, we find having BNDES (the Brazilian National Development Bank) as a minority owner to increase firms return on assets. This result is possibly due to the reduction in capital constraints provided by BNDES long-term equity.  However, we find that the effect of BNDES equity is reduced when it is associated with state-owned and private-domestic pyramidal groups.  Thus, our results suggest that minority stakes by a development bank can have a positive effect on performance as long as they promote long-term investments and are shielded from governmental interference and potential minority shareholder expropriation.",firm performance| government| industrial policy

Effects of Interfirm Experience on Alliance Governance Design,1|Rui Wu|Tsinghua U.||,,"Transaction cost economics and the capability view have been the leading theories predicting governance structures in interfirm relationships. However, these theories have yet to examine the sources of relevant knowledge and capabilities. This paper proposes that firm capabilities, in particular those that are instrumental in identifying contractual hazards, are the results of experiential learning. Specifically, in-depth experience in a specific governance structure generates exploitable knowledge with respect to the focal governance form and creates path-dependency on structural decisions. More interestingly, experience in diverse governance forms enables a firm to be more capable foreseeing exchange hazards, and provides greater flexibility for the firm to choose alternative forms, instead of following path-dependent decisions. Drawing from a sample of interfirm alliances formed between 2001 and 2005 by public companies in the US software industry, I find strong empirical supports for the proposed theoretical model.",strategic alliance| capabilities| transaction cost

We argue that previous research has confounded biases arising from experience with biases related to self-involvement (e.g. overconfidence, illusions of control) which are often pervasive and difficult to isolate from experience-based biases. We propose that, in contexts governed by uncertainty and causal ambiguity, experience accumulation by itself does not produce overconfident judgments as currently expected by superstitious learning research but rather, overconfident judgments are produced by the accumulation of experience coupled with self-involvement. We test this proposition using an experimental approach by contrasting the effects of learning throughexperience as opposed to learning through a descriptive source of information. We find evidence that, independent of subjects competence level, learning through experience produces overconfident judgments about the outcome of a task only when the experienced person is involved in the execution of a task, but not when someone else executes the task. By contrast, learning through descriptive sources leads subjects to falsely believe that others are more likely than themselves to successfully execute a task.",learning| experience| superstitious learning

Using agent-based computer simulations, I study the effects of various coordination modes on the performance of one firm under various degrees of asymmetry in the alliance. I find that increased partner dependence on the focal firm results in reduced performance of the focal firm; this effect is generally the strongest under more coordinated decision making. The effect of coordination on the performance of the focal firm depends on the internal complexities of both partners. While centralized coordination is usually the best for the focal firm, no coordination is often better than partial coordination.

Furthermore, we find that PAC contributions to finance-related committees if combined with lobbying activity are associated with more bailout money.

Instead, it appears to be fragmented across organizational units, relationship portfolios and individuals, reducing its accessibility to others within the firm and its applicability to new relationships. We find that organizations and their constituents may restrict coordination between these localized sources of experience, maintaining collaborative experience and capabilities at lower levels of the organization.

Next, I investigate how common partners and pre-existing outside contracts influence the decision to formalize relations. Finally, I investigate how mechanisms outside the partnership influence the links between formal contracts and relational mechanisms inside the partnership. I find that substantive differences in prior interactions partly explain the decision to formally contract.

So, how can firms avoid attracting these bad apples?  In this paper, we suggest that one mechanism firms use to push away these bad apples is to credibly signal toughness in legal battles with former partners.  When a firms investment in a legal battle is costly irrespective of the stakes, visible and easily interpretable by observers, it contributes to create a reputation for toughness that will reduce the cost of opportunistic behaviors in future partnerships.

Further, the related and unrelated knowledge flows were complementary to each other rather than substitutes. Our findings suggest (a) as a coordination mechanism, alliances promote knowledge transfers beyond what simply occurs due to factors such as technological overlap between pairs of firms (b) knowledge flows in unrelated areas may to some extent be inevitable and necessary for effective knowledge sharing to take place in related areas in alliances.",alliance| knowledge transfer| selection bias

We argue that such network-wide knowledge composition has a pivotal role in explaining why some firms are able to successfully participate in both exploration and exploitation activities, leading to above average firm performance, while the others fail to do so. Using data on 46 Finnish software firms, we find that the network knowledge composition is significantly related to firm performance and that such bottom-up view on interfirm networks explains more firm performance variance than the individual relational-level measures alone. Our findings provide fine-grained insights on the firm performance implications of interfirm network composition and offer an extension to the literature on interorganizational knowledge transfer and ambidexterity.",interfirm networks| knowledge transfer| network composition

This study uses data from the 2004 National Nursing Assistant Survey (NNAS) to examine the negative effects of workplace injury on nursing assistants and the workplace factors that are related to the rate of worker injury. The results found that nursing assistants who experience job-related injuries have lower levels of job satisfaction, increased turnover intentions and are less likely to recommend their facility as a place to work or seek care services. It was also found that nursing assistant injury rates are related to employee ratings of injury prevention training, supervisor support, and employee engagement. These factors offer insight to and a mechanism by which health care organizations can better understand how workplace injuries occur and the means by which to reduce the current staggering rate of on-the-job injuries occurring in health care workplaces.

Based on a survey study of 168 hospitals, we found evidence of a complex interplay between optimism and rationality with firm performance. More specifically, we find that the two-way interactions between optimism and rational decision-making are negatively associated with firm performance, and that whereoptimism was the highest the rationality-performance relationship was the most negative. We also found that greater perceived environmental turbulence, when interacting with optimism, did not have a significant interaction effect on the rationality-performance relationship.

Fostering changes within participating organizations in ways that are consistent with the alliances goals (i.e., alliance-oriented change) may be one mechanism by which alliances can coordinate diverse activities and improve care in their local communities.  In this study, we examine whether alliance-oriented change within participating organizations is associated with alliance decision-making and conflict management style, level of participation, perceptions of alliance participation benefits and costs, and awareness of alliance activities within participating organizations.  The study uses two rounds of survey data collected from organizational participants of 14 alliances participating in the Robert Wood Johnson Foundations Aligning Forces for Quality program.  Alliance participants generally report low levels of alliance-oriented change within their organizations as a result of the alliance and its activities.  However, participants reporting higher levels of internal change in response to alliance activities have more positive perceptions of alliance decision-making style, higher levels of participation in alliance activities, more positive perceptions of alliance participation benefits relative to costs, and greater awareness of alliance activities across multiple levels of their respective organizations.  Despite relatively low levels of alliance-oriented change within participating organizations, alliances may still have the means to align the goal orientations of a diverse membership and foster change that may extend the reach of the alliance in the community.",organizational change| organizational learning| health care alliances

Conceptualized as an incremental dynamic capability, practice-based learning is expected to be a vital driver of gradual organizational adaptation processes. As dynamic capabilities consist of bundles of relatively stable routines, we propose that an organizations level of practice-based learning capabilities will be highly persistent over time. We also argue that building and exercising practice-based learning capabilities is resource-intensive and will as such tend to rely on the availability of sufficient slack resources. Last, we suggest that practice-based learning will be positively related to hospital performance, especially when the underlying business model is labor- rather than capital-intensive.

Two key issues in examining innovation implementation is the extent to which physicians may experience deskilling as part of innovation use, and to what extent they actively participate in this deskilling through adaptations they make to accommodate and take advantage of the innovations in their everyday work.  The present study explored these questions using the innovations of electronic medical records and clinical practice guidelines.  Interviews were conducted with 78 U.S. primary care physicians.  Physicians perceived and experienced the use of electronic medical records and clinical guidelines in ways that indicated deskilling outcomes.  The deskilling outcomes identified include decreased clinical knowledge, decreased patient trust, increased stereotyping of patients, and decreased confidence making clinical decisions. Physicians were found to be actively involved in the deskilling process through the adaptive choices made when incorporating the innovations into their everyday work. The existing primary care business model exacerbated the deskilling effects of the two innovations examined in the study.

Providing feedback is critical for medical trainees who are expected to make mistakes, but without harming patients.  Mistakes threaten patient safety, in particular, in high-risk settings such as intensive care units (ICU), where the rate of adverse drug events is twice that of non-ICU settings. Residents seek to learn from attending physicians and other higher-ranking physicians.  However, fearful of being judged incompetent, they can hesitate and refrain from asking questions of those ranked above them in the medical hierarchy. Teaching hospitals also share ubiquitous expectations for nurses, staff pharmacists, and clinical pharmacists to monitor the safety of medication orders. Yet relatively little is known about how organizational conditions in hospitals foster (or undermine) an interprofessional learning environment. We define an interprofessional learning environment as a process during which medical residents, working in a hospital sub-unit, make clinical decisions by taking into consideration the supervision (i.e., monitoring, feedback, and guidance) provided by non-physicians, including nurses, pharmacists, and clinical pharmacists.  In a qualitative study, we analyzed in-depth interviews with 17 residents working in ICUs of three tertiary care hospitals. Part of a larger research project on how hospitals learn from medication errors, the study builds on an analysis of the interprofessional supervision of residents medication-related decisions. The current study focuses on how ICU-based residents perceived the organizational conditions that enabled them to improve patient safety by receiving feedback from and seeking guidance from other professionals. The findings identify organizational conditions that enhance (or undermine) an interprofessional learning environment.

We hypothesize that employees are more likely to speak up and offer solutions when organizations launch information campaigns to promote process improvement and when managers engage in process-improvement activities themselves. We test our hypotheses in the health-care context, in which problems are frequent and many organizations use incident-reporting systems to encourage employees to communicate about the operational problems they witness. Using data on nearly 7,500 reported incidents, we find that information campaigns encouraging process improvement promote both speaking up and offering solutions, while managerial engagement in process improvement promotes the latter.

In addition, studies from other industries have suggested that the systematic use of evidence-based management practices, or high-performance work practices (HPWPs), may be an effective but underutilized strategy to address quality of care and patient safety in healthcare organizations. We designed an extensive qualitative study to learn more about the use of HPWPs in healthcare organizations, paying particular attention to the issues associated with HPWP implementation.   For the research reported in this paper we focus on key informant interview data collected from case studies of five healthcare organizations considered to have exemplary work practices and deliver high-quality care.  These 67 key informant interviews were conducted in 2009 and included both administrative and clinical representatives of healthcare delivery systems located in various regions of the U.S.  All interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and rigorously analyzed using comprehensive qualitative analysis methods.  We found that the context for HPWP implementation in healthcare organizations was ambitious and complex, with informants expressing different views of HPWPs based on their organizational roles.  Informants reported many reasons for implementing HPWPs in theor organizations; these reasons were both micro-organizational (e.g., improving employee morale, developing leaders), and macro-organizational (e.g., desire to transform culture, improve patient outcomes).   In addition, using an evidence-based model of complex innovation adoption to frame our analysis,  we were able to describe factors that might facilitate, and those that might present challenges to, effective implementation of innovative HPWPs in healthcare organizations.  These findings help to improve our understanding of how healthcare organizations can appropriately facilitate implementation of HPWPs, and suggest how implementation of these innovative work practices can help healthcare organizations address both care quality and patient safety improvements by transcending the ordinary.",organizational development| human resources| healthcare

We test the overall effectiveness of the process improvement program by comparing performance from treatment hospitals to 49 randomly selected controls. We find that the program overall had no impact on our two performance measures: change in nurse perceptions of improvement and patient-reported quality of care. To determine whether differences in how the hospitals implemented the program influenced their results, we also test a series of hypotheses about management of the process improvement innovation tournament, such as whether generating more improvement ideas and implementing the highest impact ideas resulted in higher performance. We find that implementing a diverse set of improvement ideas and assigning implementation responsibility to senior managers was associated with better performance. Implementing the ideas rated as having the maximum severity was not associated with improved performance. We conclude that because ideas for improving safety in hospitals were distributed over a wide range of categories as opposed to being concentrated in one or two categories, process improvement programs performed better when they addressed a wide range of categories rather than limiting implementation efforts to the few ideas with maximum severity. Senior management commitment aided implementation of these ideas, which were likely to cross departmental boundaries or require organizational resources and therefore were challenging for frontline staff to implement on their own.",process improvement| innovation tournament| hospitals

A survey of 201 employees within 20 trauma centers showed that employees who perceived a better fit between their abilities and the new job demands were more positive about the change.

Management systems and TQM/CQI processes affect treatment center performance to a much greater extent when resource availability is high.  The results suggest a) that the specific practices integral to TQM/CQI processes may be needed in order for high performance management practices to impact treatment center organizations and b) that the positive effects of strengthened management systems and TQM/CQI processes within SUD  treatment center operations may be realized only if accompanied by higher levels of resource availability. .",quality management| substance abuse treatment| management systems

The result is a widespread phenomenon of crowded emergency rooms, especially in urban hospitals, which has become a major barrier to receiving timely care and has been implicated in adverse medical outcomes.  This paper develops a stylized system dynamics model to examine the dynamics of patient flow in emergency departments.  Simulation results show that increased ED resilience can come from relaxing bed constraints or from more human capability to cope with increasing workloads.  The vulnerability of this system is rooted in the critical interaction between physical constraints imposed by the environment and the human capability of the staff to work at high performance levels under conditions of worsening workload pressure.",emergency department| patient flow| system dynamics

Newman Award Nominee||,"This paper explores influences on managerial behavior when reviewing adverse events in the high-risk, knowledge-intensive service delivery setting of a high-performing teaching hospital.  Based on interviews with organizational decision-makers involved in adverse event review and regression analysis of internal medical case data, I find that the level of organizational review accorded to an adverse event was associated with severity of injury to the patient; perceived risk of a malpractice lawsuit; the number of departments involved in the event; and preventability of the event.  The odds of review for adverse events caused fully or in part by skill-based errors, or those committed while performing familiar tasks due to sensorimotor or attention failures, and those involving device malfunction were higher than those for events that did not involve these errors.  Despite managers promotion of organizational review for adverse events caused by coordination errors when acting on their own discretion, external reporting requirements mandated by state regulators shaped managerial decision-making when reviewing adverse events, constraining opportunities to review events at the senior level that did not conform to harm-driven regulatory priorities.  Findings demonstrate that reporting regulation focused predominantly on outcomes can distort internal learning processes by shifting managerial attention away from adverse events that carry valuable information for organizational improvement and toward those yielding less new and actionable knowledge.  These unintended effects suggest the need for separate compliance and learning activities in high-risk organizational settings subject to intensive regulation to ensure that the rules and norms governing internal structures for reviewing work process failure are aligned with learning goals.",error| incident review| organizational learning

Huckman|Harvard U.||3|Ryan Thompson|Massachusetts General Hospital||,,"Many hospital patients suffer from a constellation of multiple conditions that span a wide range of disease categories. Logically associated with this breadth of conditions is the breadth of expertise maintained by specific health care organizations. Recent contributions to the medical literature have noted that the U.S. health system may be ill-designed to deal effectively with these co-occurring conditions. Moreover, debate continues regarding the optimal scope of health care organizations, with some scholars questioning whether, given co-morbidities, there are natural limits to the breadth of expertise required to care effectively for patients. In this paper, we investigate this possibility by analyzing patterns of co-morbidity and considering the implications for the optimal configuration of health care organizations. More specifically, drawing on organization theory and the tools of network analysis, we explore co-morbidity as a network of diseases and draw two conclusions. First, co-morbidities among hospital patients exhibit clear patterns, which we characterize with a core/periphery structure. Second, these patterns suggest there may be natural limits to the expertise required at organizations caring for patients with core conditions and that there may be opportunities for disease- or disease-cluster-focused organizations caring for peripheral ones. Though hospitals may face other considerations that necessitate offering otherwise clinically independent services, our findings suggest that even where co-morbidities imply a broader organizational scope, the clinical optimum likely stops short of everything for everybody organizations.",hospitals| organizational scope| networks

Young|Northeastern U.||,,"Background: Research generally shows greater resource use fails to translate into higher quality health care. Organizational slack is defined as extra organizational resources needed to meet demand. Divergent views exist on organizational slack in health care. Some authors view slack negatively because it is wasteful, inefficient, and costly, while others view slack positively because it allows flexibility in new approaches, expanding available services, and protecting against environmental changes.Objective: We tested a curvilinear relationship between organizational slack and care quality. Methods:  The study setting was primary care clinics (n=590) in the Veterans Health Administration (VA). We examined organizational slack using the patient panel size per capacity ratio and support staff per provider ratio staffing guidelines developed by VA. Patient-level outcomes were influenza vaccinations, continuity of care, and overall quality of care. We obtained two independent patient samples with approximately 29,500 and 64,000 observations. We used multilevel modeling and examined the linear and quadratic terms for both organizational slack measures.Results: We found a significant curvilinear effect for panel size per capacity for vaccinations and overall quality of care. We also found support staff per provider ratio had a curvilinear effect on continuity of care. Greater available resources led to better care, but at a certain point, additional resources provided minimal quality gains.Conclusion: Our findings highlight the importance for primary care clinic managers monitoring staffing levels. Health care systems managing a balanced provider workload and staff-mix may realize better patient care delivery and cost management.",resources| health care| quality

Despite this, a growing body of academic literature suggests that involvement is often tokenistic and unauthentic. An option for many professionals is to involve the articulate, educated and skilled user who they are able to work alongside with. As a consequence, extant literature highlights concerns that the views of service users employed as representatives are not representative of the wider community of users. Using data from a qualitative case study, examining user involvement in a service development initiative, we examine the process and reasons through which less representative user involvement emerges. The study confirms that that the articulate and expert user is selected by professionals to become involved in service development, rather than more representative users with lay experiences. Following which, professionals educate and socialize these users, and in so doing, co-opt them towards professional interests. Those service users that professionals do not select, find they are marginalized by the professionals whom they seek to influence, as they enact their user involvement role. In essence, the contribution of articulate and expert users is supported as long as they serve professional interests. That the articulate and expert user accepts this is due to their own ambitions to professionalize the user body through delineating a distinctive body of knowledge and position that bounds their jurisdiction, and from which they can exclude lay users.",representativeness| professions| user involvement

In an effort to address the gap, this paper focuses on the implementation of a state health intervention by two community-based health and human services organizations. A longitudinal, case study design was used, centered on the implementation of an outreach program as the state heath intervention.  The case study data gathered over nearly 4 years included interview data with the managers overseeing implementation of the outreach program, observations and notes of regularly scheduled outreach worker staff meetings, and quantitative data regarding the outreach efforts made by the outreach workers.  Both not-for-profit agencies were well known to state officials for work conducted in their community areas, and provided a blend of health promotion services and human services to the poor, predominantly African-American residents in their communities. The analytic approach to answering the question of what influenced the implementation of the state health intervention was a blend of force field analysis and situational analysis.  Seven forces were identified as having an effect at both agencies: leadership, internal services integration, personnel commitment, teamwork, organizational culture, community resources and payment. The force field analysis shows how those forces worked for or against more successful implementation of outreach efforts in each agency. Several implications for management practice are suggested by the forces identified, as well as potential avenues for theory development and research in the areas of transactions costs, and inter-organizational networks and gatekeeping.",health care| innovation adoption| case study

Already it has induced the SC to warn Chinas multinational enterprises (MNEs) that foreign competitors may highlight Chinese colour in order to undermine the competitiveness of  Chinas MNEs. This is a step bound to be extended to open retaliation should the SC conclude other actors are seeking to utilise sinophobia as a competitive asset. Consequently, host country actors opposed to corporate racism need to develop a sophisticated understanding both of how firms might incorporate race into their business strategies and how Chinese FDI is viewed by national and local communities.

Density dependence theory, however, advises being neither early nor late entrants, but being entrants in-between for survival advantages. To resolve this apparent paradox, we draw upon multiple theories to build a foreign market entry and performance model to integrate these three entry positions. We argue that multiple forces interact with one another during the foreign entry process, resulting in an S-shaped curvilinear relationship between entry order and subsidiary survival and a U-shaped relationship between entry time and profitability.

We extend this TCE perspective by proposing that whether a regional (i.e., higher HRF) or global (i.e., lower HRF) strategy leads to greater firm efficiency depends on the degree of regional integration (i.e., economic and policy coordination) of the MNEs home regions. Thus, this is the first study in the regional/global strategies literature to analyze the effects of HRF and regional integration (economic and policy) on firms technical efficiency performance. We find that economies of regionalization arise only when firms align their HRF strategy with the degree of regional economic integration, but diseconomies of regionalization are possible if there is misalignment between the two.

As part of this discussion particular attention is paid to the recognition of multivocality in narrative studies and of the methodological issues associated with allowing for multivocality.  We also comment on the growth of narrative studies into identity in situations of organizational change, some of which present a return to univocal assumptions, and consider whether the continued interest in analysis of narratives in terms of genre or plot types also reflects researchers own desire to impose some semblance of order, or meta-narrative, over what is necessarily a complex field.  Finally, the implications of this consideration are examined and prospects and challenges for future research in this area are outlined.",narratives| organizational change

We aim to understand better the underlying processes responsible for an organizations stickiness to a once adopted strategic path. It is argued that well-known symptoms of strategic torpor such as managerial myopia can be further explained by referring to self-reinforcing mechanisms and processes of self-reinforcing feedback which lie at the heart of the path dependence concept. The paper draws on empirical findings from an in-depth analysis of the strategic development of a Bio-manufacturing company in the UK. By reconstructing the strategic path of the case study organization we investigate how a strategic pattern has emerged over time and explain why this pattern is still maintained despite recognising its limitations and the need for change. In order to explain this counter-factual maintenance of the original strategic orientation and resulting organizational inertia the paper introduces the concept of a strategic core  a self-reinforcing mechanism consisting of deeply rooted patterns of resource allocation and cognitive schemas which complement each other. Exposing the phenomenon of strategic core reveals how a path dependent organization detaches itself from its relevant strategic environment by cultivating in an insular fashion such a strategic core.,path dependence| rigidity| strategic lock-in

Yet firms incur costs in developing and maintaining networks, thus making it necessary to evaluate the contribution of both internal and external networks to firm innovation performance. In this paper we theorize and test two concepts.  First we argue that internal and external networks are complements; firms need to make investments in both to maximize the innovation performance outcome. Second, we make the argument that internal and external networks are substitutes; firms need to manage their network investments to reduce costs while improving innovation performance.  Based on a large sample of UK manufacturing firms we find that internal and external networks act as substitutes.  Further our analysis indicates that internal and external networks lead to different outcomes when incremental and radical innovation performance is examined.

1410,,4|Strategic Patenting and the Tragedy of Anticommons: A Closer Look at Firms Patenting Behavior,1|Keyvan Vakili|U. of Toronto||,,"The effect of fragmentation of property rights on firms patenting behavior is ambiguous given the seemingly inconsistent findings of prior research. On one hand, studies that emanate from concepts such as patent thickets and the tragedy of anticommons suggest that a dense overlapping set of fragmented property rights can result in technological stagnation and, hence, in a decline in firms patenting rate. On the other hand, research derived from such notions as strategic patenting argues that firms facing a fragmented external technology market will engage in patent proliferation strategies. In this paper, I develop an integrated theoretical model that captures the main features of both arguments. Indeed, the model posits that firms are more likely to engage in patent proliferation strategies when their technologies draw on patents assigned to a disperse set of outside entities. However, as the overlapping claims of these external right holders increase, the expected infringement costs associated with a patent proliferation strategy may exceed its benefits. Furthermore, the model suggests that firms with a strong initial patent portfolio are less likely to pursue an aggressive patenting strategy. The model is empirically tested using panel data of patenting behavior of public firms in the semiconductors industry from 1980 to 1999. The results support the model predictions and, in particular, they confirm that the negative impact of overlapping external rights on firms patenting rate is larger, in absolute terms, than the positive effect of a distributed set of complementary patents.",strategic patenting| tragedy of anticommons| patenting behavior

Our study was motivated by some important gaps in the corporate entrepreneurship literature on venturing and renewal. There is limited understanding of the different types and dimensions of firms renewal activities. In particular, more understanding of discontinuous renewal, involving shifts in firms core businesses, is required.  There has also been very little examination of conditions that drive firms to undertake strategic renewal. For example, it is not known how venturing increases or reduces the benefits of renewal that involves shifts away from core businesses.  We focus on firms external venturing initiatives by examining CVC investments.  We argue that CVC investments create growth options in new and existing businesses but these options do not result in firms withdrawal from existing businesses. Therefore, CVC activity is negatively associated with the likelihood of a firm undertaking discontinuous renewal. The benefits of withdrawing from existing businesses are even lower, and the costs even higher, for firms in dynamic industries that possess strong internal capabilities. We test our predictions using longitudinal data on 477 firms from the 1990 Fortune 500 list for the period 1990-2000.  Our results imply that external venturing allows firms to avoid discontinuous renewal involving withdrawal from existing businesses into new and unfamiliar ones.

A failure to differentiate between substantial restructuring and symbolic restructuring may result in an important contingency between corporate restructuring and firm performance being missed. In this study, I investigate the performance implication of substantial vs. symbolic restructuring in emerging economies. More importantly, I investigate how the local government support moderates the performance implication of substantial and symbolic restructurings. Recognizing that the substantial vs. symbolic restructuring choice is endogenous, I employ a propensity score matching method to obtain a matched symbolic restructuring as the counterpart for each substantial restructuring. I examine whether their post-restructuring efficiency scores diverge using the difference-in-difference approach. The results show that substantial restructurings leads to greater efficiency improvements than symbolic restructurings only when there is a well-developed legal system or when the firm has obtained local government support. Furthermore, I investigate those aspects of the firm!-s arrangements in which local government support contributes to the success of substantial restructuring. The results show that local government support enhances substantial restructuring only when it deals with ownership arrangements, rather than business refocusing. Hence, the study unravels the mechanisms through which local government participation leads to the success or failure of corporate restructuring.",emerging economies| corporate restructuring| symbolism

Our model builds on work done in the Carnegie tradition and in other decision-theoretic disciplines.  We use the model to explore when delegation is preferable to the more ""crowdlike"" structures of voting and averaging.  We show that delegation is the most effective only when there is diversity of expertise, when accurate delegation is possible, and when there is a good fit between the firm's knowledge and the knowledge required by the environment.  Otherwise, depending on the knowledge breadth of the firm, voting or averaging may be the most effective structure.  Finally, we use our model to shed light on which structures are more robust to radical environmental change and also to answer calls for a better understanding of the microfoundations of strategy.",organizational structure| decision making| knowledge

It uses a study conducted with 89 graduate students and a model that combines highly mindful  cognitive processes and routinized (less-mindful) behavioral responses to explain the performance of R&D resource-allocation choices. Three findings emerge from the data. First, cognitive control capabilities, i.e. the supervisory cognitive mechanisms through which individuals monitor and control their own attention processes, positively influence decision-makingperformance. Second, the degree of routinization of decision-making also has a positive influence on performance. Third, routinization fully mediates the impact of cognitive control capabilities on decision-making performance. Hence, both high and low levels of mindfulness are essential to maximize the performance of strategic decisions such as R&D resource allocation. Counterintuitively, however, higher cognitive control capabilities are  connected to higher levels of routinization, which in turn enhance performance. Also, combinations of high routinization/low cognitive control capabilities perform significantly better than their complements, giving routinization a more important role than cognitive control capabilities in explaining decision-making performance. These findings might contribute towards the development of an integrated theory of cognition, decision-making and learning.",microfoundations| routines| cognitive control capabilities

We have an observable measure of aspirations to validate our estimation of the weights for different components in aspiration adjustment; we estimate a set of such weights for each magazine, and we account for both internal and external reference groups (other magazines in the same content category and sister magazines under the same publisher).

The data show that individuals can reflect on experience in two different ways: through superficial and deep reflection. Deep reflection leads to complex causal cognitive models that describe how different elements in a system influence each other, whereas superficial reflection results in strip maps that lay out a simple set of action steps. We recognize three characteristics that differentiate deep reflection from surface reflection. Moreover, we find that even if an individual has reflected on experience in a deep way, he or she may store and communicate the lessons learned in the form of surface manifestations instead of deep structured knowledge. We argue that successful M&A capability development requires both deep reflection and the storing and communication of causal knowledge.",cognition| learning| acquisition

Knowledge that is easily transferred and replicated may also be easily imitated. However, this interesting dilemma of replication and imitation as flip sides of the same coin has not received enough research attention. We suggest an integrated framework to resolve this issue, highlighting non-teachability of knowledge and contextual idiosyncrasy as two key constructs in solving the replication-imitation dilemma. We argue that, in order to facilitate internal replication but to impede external imitation, firms should first increase ""non-teachability"" making both replication and imitation inherently difficult, then leverage ""contextual idiosyncrasy"" - coming from a combination of resource, capability, and organizational mechanism - as a mechanism to overcome such difficulty on the part of internal replicators but further raise the difficulty faced by outside imitators. This study highlights the joint consideration of the concept of inimitability and organization of VRIO framework and clarifies the previously weak complementarities between them.",knowledge-replication/imitation dilemma| non-teachability| idiosyncrasy

In this paper, we use an agent-based simulation model to address a basic trade-off: On the one hand, higher-powered incentives raise the potential gains if an employees project idea is implemented. On the other hand, higher-powered incentives fuel competition among employees and thus lower the chances that ones project will be selected. Our results make a case for the power of weak incentive intensity. While strong incentive intensity results in higher search efforts by employees and a higher number of projects, the additional gains of the overall search activities rapidly decrease, while the costs of the incentive system increase linearly. If organizational resources are scarce, higher-powered incentives create an excessive pipeline of good innovation projects that lie idle. A congested project pipeline further boosts competition among employees and reduces the agents motivation for search. Higher-powered incentives, however, can still be effective in small firms and if strong persistence is necessary to develop project ideas. Based on these findings, we develop a set of empirical propositions and discuss the broader implications of our results for the management of innovation, the boundaries of firms, and organizational adaptation and design.",organizational search| incentives| simulation

We test this tension by examining the effects of expertise at the CEO and top management team on the likelihood of technology change among the population of U.S. solar photovoltaic manufacturing ventures between 1992 and 2007. Surprisingly we find that firms led by experts at both the CEO and management team level are actually more rigid, decreasing the likelihood of change. Furthermore, we find that firms led by non-experts (at the CEO and management team level) are in fact more flexible and likely to change technology. To explore these theories more we also conduct an interaction analysis in which we contrast the value of complementary knowledge, as suggested by the knowledge-based view, against the role of team structure, as suggested by a cognitive flexibility perspective. Interestingly we find that knowledge complementarity alone is insufficient to increase change. In contrast, cognitively flexible team structures can reverse the negative effects of expertise or amplify the positive benefits of cognitive flexibility. Finally, we argue that because technology ventures inhabit dynamic internal and external environments, change should be beneficial to performance and we find a positive relationship between change and performance.",change| cognition| entrepreneurship

Evidence from M&A Advisors,1|Olivier Chatain|U. of Pennsylvania||2|Philipp Meyer|U. of Pennsylvania||,,"The matching of capabilities to tasks is one of the most fundamental decisions in organizations, and the outcome of this decision critically impacts on performance. Yet very little evidence exists on the factors that determine a firms decision to match its capabilities to tasks. This paper attempts to fill this gap by examining determinants of a firms decision to match individual-level capabilities to tasks. We relate the capacity constraint and characteristics of the firms individual-level capabilities as well as the task characteristics to the likelihood of a capability being matched to a particular task. We empirically study how UK M&A law firms allocate their lawyers to M&A mandates. Our dataset on lawyers (individual-level capabilities) and M&A mandates (tasks) allows us to observe which lawyers have and which have not been staffed on particular mandates. We find that more capacity constrained lawyers are significantly less likely to be deployed in new deals. However this effect is mooted by the quality and experience of the lawyer, suggesting that law firms leverage the value-added of these highly valuable resources across more deals and that more experienced and better lawyers are also more efficient in their capacity deployment. Furthermore, consistent with an efficient allocation, we find that a firms best lawyers are deployed in higher value deals; however we do not find evidence that law firms match their best capabilities to tasks of high future value, suggesting that clients do not appear to suffer from moral hazard due to law firms capability deployment decisions.",capability deployment| capabilities| mergers and acquisitions

We find that, within the constraints imposed by the formal structure, the affective value of social relationships in organizations stimulates task interaction and alters the interactions instrumental value, without being shaped by either. We conclude that the affective content of task-related ties is primal: it occurs at a more basic level than instrumental evaluations and it influences the structuration of task-related networks through a multiplicity of causal paths not accounted for by formal-structural requirements.",organizational theory| networks| affect

New connections form because of physical proximity, shared demographics, and the demands of a job; old connections disappear due to the finite nature of managers' time and the changes that they all experience. More recently, however, the proliferation of the internet and social networking sites has made it remarkably easy for people to reconnect their former ties. Yet we know very little about whether and why people reconnect for work; we also know very little about whether and why these reconnections might (or might not be) effective. To address these questions, we asked 117 Executive MBA students to reconnect two of their ""dormant"" ties. Our results suggest that the idea of reconnecting creates anxiety that leads executives to fall back on old familiar ties (i.e., people they used to interact with frequently or have known for a long time) as the primary basis for reconnecting. Ironically, these kinds of reconnections are significantly less useful, as they offer relatively few new insights. Instead, a more pro-active, future-oriented outlook provides more value: even though this is not their natural tendency, executives gain more when they reconnect with someone whom they expect will be trustworthy and willing to share. Thus, for the best reconnections, a backwards focus, however natural, is dysfunctional, and a forwards focus on expected relationship quality can be particularly effective at providing new and useful information.",interpersonal relationships| knowledge transfer| social capital

However, most, if not all, of the studies investigating the determinants of knowledge sharing are either focused on knowledge-intensive organizations such as consultancy firms or R&D organizations, or knowledge workers in regular organizations, while lesser knowledge intensive organizations or non-knowledge workers are rarely explored. This is a gap in the literature on social networks and knowledge sharing. Inthis paper, the relations between network determinants and actor determinants of knowledge sharing are empirically tested by means of a network survey in a less knowledge intensive organization, specifically employees of a Dutch department store chain. The results show that individual-level variables such as departmental commitment and enjoyment in helping others are the major determinants of individuals knowledge sharing behavior, but none of the social network variables play a role. The results thus present an important boundary condition to social networks effects on knowledge sharing: social networks only seem to play arole in knowledge sharing for knowledge workers, not for blue-collar workers.",knowledge sharing| intraorganizational networks| knowledge intensive firms

To empirically test our hypotheses, we conducted a survey of 2,230 firms from 16 European countries representing different institutional contexts in terms of socialist legacy, societal governance, and European Union membership status. Hierarchical linear modeling results indicate that these facets of institutional environments have different effects on the implementation of CR practices as well as moderating effects on the relationship between the implementation of CR practices and firms business outcomes. As such, this study contributes to a better understanding of the effect of institutional environments on the outcomes of firms implementation of stakeholder-focused CR practices across countries.",corporate social and environmental responsibility| stakeholders| institutional theory

Examining the joint distribution of an index of firms CSR behavior and an indicator of whether or not firms lobby reveals that firms at both the positive and the negative extremes of social responsibility are more likely to have been politically active.  Regressing the CSR index and a measure of lobbying intensity, individually, on Tobins Q allows me to test whether CSR and corporate political activity separately enhance firms value; regressing an interaction between the CSR index and the measure of lobbying intensity on Tobins Q, allows me to test whether they play complementary roles in enhancing firms value.  Higher CSR ratings, more intensive lobbying, and the interaction between CSR rating and lobbying intensity all appear to increase value when comparing firms; however, when each firm is studied over time, only the interaction between CSR rating and lobbying intensity appear to increase firm value.  Taken together this suggests that firms CSR initiatives work as a complement to its political activity rather than a substitutejointly the two types of non-market behavior increase a firms value, while independently each activity is more difficult to reconcile and perhaps may simply be symptomatic of some other inherently unobservable firm-fixed characteristic such as good management.",non-market strategy| corporate political activity| corporate social responsibility

This negative relationship may grow stronger when the firms image is closely associated with community engagement.

One approach to this has been to decompose variance in firm-level profitability into firm, supra-firm and industry components. This paper seeks to contribute to this literature in two main ways. First, in contrast to previous literature which has focused almost exclusively on listed corporations in the United States, we analyze differences in profitability between firms (both listed and non-listed), operating in all industries with the exception of the agrarian sector in 25 European countries. These data allow us to investigate the influence of country effects alongside firm, business group, industry and year effects. The size of the database allows us to use a repeated sampling approach in the analysis of the underlying population of firms along country, industry and size dimensions. Our second contribution is methodological. We propose a new method of variance decomposition, the Shapley Value method. Relative to methods used in prior studies, the Shapley Value method obtains more accurate estimates of the contributions of the different effects to the variance in firm profitability in the presence of covariance between effects. We show this by evaluating it against alternatives using Monte-Carlo simulations. Our empirical results suggest that business group effects are the second largest source of variance in firm-level profitability after firm effects, and that the importance of the business group appears to decrease with increasing group size.

Specifically, bold moves to capture these stakeholders help to realize the potential generated through entrepreneurial discovery.  Conversely, the absence of defensive stratagems, especially in factors markets, makes new entrants vulnerable to attacks and competitive escalation throughout their value chain.

Rather than viewing political ties as generic conduits for exchange, we suggest instead that different types of political ties (e.g. formal, family, and social ties) may make a focal firm politically embedded to distinct levels, and thus affect its entry decisions differentially. Using the largest 100 business groups in Taiwan between 1986 and 1996 as our empirical setting, we find that political ties generally facilitate business groups!- expansion into new industries, but this effect is contingent on the types of political ties. Moreover, the complementarity between different types of political ties further broadens the scope of business groups.",political tie| market entry| business group

We also propose that structural actions can partly mitigate the costs associated with BG affiliation. Specifically, we argue that public listing of a BG firm is a form of selective intervention that infuses elements of market control in a hierarchy, thus improving monitoring and performance incentives, and will positively moderate the relationship between BG affiliation and performance. We examine evidence in an unbalanced panel dataset of 10453 BG and non-BG firms from India during the post-liberalization period of 1994-2009 and find support for our arguments.",business groups| selective intervention| institutional change

We conceive of each affiliated firm as occupying one of three distinct structural positions in regard to maintaining operational control over a large number of affiliate firms: (1) controller, (2) intermediary, and (3) receiver. We develop theory and hypotheses linking the structural positions with economic performance. In addition, we examine whether the relation is contingent upon intra-group transactions, foreign ownership, and sensitivity to market uncertainty. Operationally, we identify each firm's positions in the equity network by using Winship and Mandel's (1983) role equivalence algorithm and test our hypotheses using the sample of Korean large business groups or Chaebols between 2005 and 2008. Our results suggest that group affiliates occupying the controller and receiver position outperform independent firms while those occupying the intermediary position do not. Finally, we find that internal transactions, foreign ownership, and sensitivity to market uncertainty moderate the relations between the structural positions and economic performance.",equity network| business group affiliation| structural position

Malik|Dongbei U. of Finance and Economics||,,"The literature on corporate acquisition strategies for related uncertainty reduction offers two perspectives. One perspective argues that strategic alliances can be uses as real options as a mechanism for uncertainty reduction and eventual acquisition. The other perspective suggests that the acquirer should offer low premium in highly targets. We offer an alternative perspective to reduce acquisition uncertainty. We propose that the flow of managerial resource from rival incumbents to the potential acquisition target signals high value, low uncertainty and eventual acquisition. Our findings indicate that the acquisition target is more likely to be acquired when it hires more senior managers, the managers are from the industrial leaders, and the mangers are high ranking officials. We also found that listed companies are more likely to be acquired than private companies. Thus, we conclude that the managerial flow can be a predicting mechanism for the acquisition.Paper is No Longer Available Online: Please contact the author(s).Conventional wisdom posits that successful parents produce successful offspring firms, generally through the migration of executives from the parent to the offspring.

While extant research often uses knowledge transfer and spillover interchangeably, our study distinguishes between the two based on the rivalness of the relevant knowledge.  We theorize that both knowledge transfer (proxied by the exiting employee team size) and knowledge spillovers (proxied by experience of the exiting employee team) will aid spin-out performance.  However, knowledge transfer, being more rival, will have a greater adverse impact than knowledge spillovers on parent firm performance.

In this study, we argue that acquirers incorporate expectations about potential employee mobility in a firm into their decisions regarding whether to bid for the firm, suggesting a negative relationship between the expected employee mobility in a firm and the likelihood of the firm being an acquisition target. We exploit an inadvertent change in the enforcement of non-compete agreements in Michigan as an observable, exogenous source of variation in employee mobility. Using a difference-in-differences approach and the population of listed firms in Michigan and a set of comparison states, we find causal evidence that constraints on employee mobility raise the likelihood that a Michigan firm becomes an acquisition target. We also find that the effect is stronger when the firm is exposed to greater risks of employee mobility, such as when the firm employs more knowledge workers in its work force and when it faces greater instate competition; by contrast, the effect is weaker when the firm is protected by a stronger intellectual property regime that can mitigate knowledge loss due to employee mobility.",acquisition| human capital| employee mobility

Some studies reveal that partner-specific alliance experience motivates the focal firm to enter into further alliances with the target firm, while others show that it increases the likelihood of its acquisition. Based on a review of prior evidence, we establish a better understanding of the PAX-governance choice relationship by adopting a transactional value perspective. We further include market uncertainty, rivalry and financial capacity as moderating variables in order to shed light on the circumstances influencing the effect of PAX on the choice between alliances and acquisitions. We empirically test our hypotheses using a quasi-experimental policy capturing design. Our results indicate that PAX enhances the likelihood of acquiring the target firm.

Tracy|Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute||,,"Previous research has either examined the effect of experience on the choice between Joint Ventures (JVs) and Acquisitions, or the impact of experience on the performance associated with these governance forms. We take a different approach and argue that experience with an organizational form tilts the balance and realigns transactions at the margin toward that form. To test this argument we focus on the appropriability hazards between a pair of firms combining their resources. Transaction Cost Economics (TCE) suggests as appropriability hazards increase, acquisitions will be preferred over JVs. In contrast we show experience has a moderating effect and increases the propensity that a transaction with given appropriability hazards would be conducted using that form. Thus in the presence of JV experience, transactions with relatively high levels of appropriability hazards (hazards that would have otherwise prompted an acquisition) would tend to be organized using shared governance. Conversely, in the presence of acquisition experience, transactions with relatively lower levels of appropriability hazards would tend to internalized. Utilizing a switching regression model we show that these moderating effects and the realignment of transactions thereof are consistent with value maximization. Our study implies experience and capabilities do not just influence performance or the propensity of choosing a particular form, but also the nature of the transactions conducted through that form.",acquisitions| alliances| organizational learning

In this paper, bounded rationality is construed as the negative link between activity load and performance. It focuses on the role of prior experience as a positive moderator of that link and the quality of such experience (e.g., the performance of past events) as a negative moderator. A sample of 7,267 investments made by 256 private equity funds offers support for the hypothesized effects. Surprisingly, the stock of prior experience has a strong, direct, negative effect on the performance of the focal acquisition, which contrasts with the positive, indirect effect arising from routinization and economization of scarce attention resources. These results have important implications for our understanding of attention processes in strategic decision making, and the effects of experiential and superstitious learning processes on performance outcomes.",buyouts| learning| attention

Our examination of the effects of pre-acquisition alliance duration on acquisition outcomes incorporates the concept of honeymoon period (Fichman & Levinthal, 1991). We hypothesize that an acquisition decision is vulnerable to bias and illusion if the decision is made during the honeymoon period of the pre-acquisition alliance. On the contrary, acquisition decisions made after the honeymoon period of pre-acquisition alliance is over reflect more exact information and a more sober understanding of the target. This hypothesis is examined in a panel database made up of acquisitions performed by French firms in the US between January 1988 and December 2006. We show that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between the duration of pre-acquisition alliance and the probability of acquisition failure. Our results also highlight that the non-monotonic relationship between the duration of pre-acquisition alliance with the target and the probability of acquisition failure is moderated by the degree of partner commitment to the alliance.",acquisition performance| pre-acquisition alliance| honeymoon period

Focus-increasing divestments are expected to lead to an increase in both R&D spending and innovation productivity, as well as a narrowing of the firms technological focus. Results from a cross-industry panel of US manufacturing firms from 1986 to 2002 shows that focus-increasing divestments are followed by increased quality of innovation output, especially where the firm has strong complementary resources. A reduction in corporate scope does not automatically map to a reduction in technological diversity, however. Firms with limited opportunities in their core business, or with access to markets for technology, may continue to pursue innovation in a diversity of areas even after they reduce their corporate scope. The paper thus provides novel insights into the evolution of firm technological capabilities post-divestment, and contributes to our understanding of the relationship between technology and corporate scope.",divestment| technological innovation| corporate scope

Firms are more likely to spin off their legacy businesses the less accurate the earnings forecasts analysts make about them, suggesting that external perceptions are an important motivation for legacy spinoffs.  However, forecast accuracy improves following the completion of legacy spinoffs, while remaining largely unchanged following all other spinoffs.  This improvement may be linked to the fact that analysts conduct more detailed research about the firms which spin off their legacy businesses than they do about companies which spin off non-legacy units.  Overall, these results suggest that legacy spinoffs may have changed the way these firms were perceived by relevant external constituents in the capital market.",spinoffs| analysts| corporate strategy

Using a resource-based view lens, I hypothesize about differential value creation among the four rationales. I find that the targets technological capabilities create more value when there is little technological overlap between the target and the acquirer and that the acquirers technological capabilities create more value when the acquirer is a technological leader. Further, I find that acquirers benefit most from combining the targets and the acquirers technological capabilities when both little technological overlap is present and the acquirer is a technological leader.

We test our hypotheses on a sample of 798 advertising agency-client ties, for which the client was involved in an acquisition. Our results show that, from the buyers perspective, an increase in competitive overlap has a negative effect on the likelihood of tie continuation which is moderated by the relative intensity of investment in the service provided by the focal suppliers. From the suppliers perspective we find that the negative effect of an increase in competitive overlap on the likelihood of tie continuation is moderated by the importance of the buyer to the supplier.

Dominant designs are thought to usher in a period of intense competition based on cost, and causing an often fierce industry shakeout. In this paper, we aim to challenge some of the foundations of the dominant design literature, and draw new insights about implications for competition that have yet to be explored. Whereas dominant designs are often described as originating outside the industry or arriving exogenously, we argue that they often emerge endogenously from the competitive process. In particular, we develop the argument that dominant designs often derive from the introduction of a particular product by a particular firm  a product for which demand turns out to be, unexpectedly, very high. This product is what we call the conpositio desiderata. A conpositio desiderata, not the establishment of a dominant design, we argue, is what often leads to industry shakeouts, and sparks associated competitive dynamics. We develop several implications of our arguments for the causes of exit and competitive responses of following firms to the introduction of the conpositio desiderata. We test these implications on population-level data from the early U.S. auto industry, in which we consider Fords Model T as a conpositio desiderata.Paper is No Longer Available Online: Please contact the author(s).",

We avoid the assumption of the independence of irrelevant alternatives by employing a simulated maximum likelihood estimator of a probit model. The main findings can be summarised as follows: (1) As efficiency increases, the firm is less likely to choose any mode of entry other than a wholly owned Greenfield investment. (2) As the international experience of the parent firm increases the likelihood of a wholly owned M&A project increases relative to a wholly owned Greenfield entry. (3) A high corruption level in the host economy shifts preferences of the parent firm away from M&A entries. (4) A long distance from Germany to the host economy decreases the likelihood of choosing a M&A investment; especially a wholly owned M&A investment.",mode of entry| multinational firms| mergers and acquisitions

However, not all types of diversification create the same opportunities for growth. We examine how different types of business diversification and international diversification influence growth option value. According to real options theory, uncertainty increases the value of a real option. We argue that for our sample of U.S. firms, international diversification into emerging economies is likely to result in higher levels of growth option value than expansion into advanced economies due to the higher endogenous and exogenous uncertainty of the emerging markets. Following similar logic, we argue that business diversification into unrelated businesses is likely to produce higher levels of growth option value relative to related diversification. We empirically test these arguments using a panel dataset of 430 firms from the S&P 1500 over a period of 9 years (1998-2006). Our findings suggest that international expansion into emerging economies has a positive influence on growth option value. Expansion into related business markets appears to have a negative influence on growth option value.

It starts with the premise that if the primary function of MNCs is to exploit arbitrage opportunities across institutional environments, then institutional differences create coordination costs as well. The choice of organization structure, such as the delegation of supervisory responsibilities to local units, is an important vehicle to countervail such coordination costs. Using data on the business activities and internal reporting relationships within U.S. multinational manufacturers from 1996 to 2008, I find that MNCs units in host countries with weaker institutions are more likely to report to a foreign, as opposed to domestic, supervisory unit. In addition, units in weak institutions are even more likely to be supervised by a foreign unit (a) if their activities are more interdependent with the rest of their MNC parents global operations, or (b) if their MNC parents operate in more diverse institutional environments. These findings confirm that differential delegation within a hierarchical structure is used by MNCs to achieve coordination among their global units.",organization structure| coordination| global strategy

The initial purpose and main application area of CPM was to support corporate management in the definition of the boundaries of a firm, the allocation of resources and the assignment of specific roles and targets for each business unit. Today, CPM is still regarded as a highly relevant aspect of strategic management in the corporate landscape, but little is known about the application of CPM instruments in corporate practice. Based on a global survey among 196 senior executives of the largest companies worldwide, we identified three distinct types of CPM users: Corporate Developers, Business Unit Steerers and Passive Portfolio Managers. These different patterns of CPM application can be traced back to a set of company characteristics which include the underlying market structure, portfolio structure and portfolio size. Moreover, we can demonstrate that the CPM user type has a significant influence on the characteristics of the implemented CPM processes as well as on the integration of CPM with other corporate processes.",strategic planning| corporate portfolio management| application clusters

In extreme cases where managers cannot be incented contractually (due to contract costs), private ownership is thought to be the primary organizational substitute.  In this paper we explore geographic clustering as an alternative strategy for controlling managerial agency costs within the chain form of organization.  Clustering may facilitate scale efficiencies in monitoring and control.  We test this hypothesis in the nursing home industry, which is characterized by significant managerial contract costs that result from multi-task models of production.  Our tests show that nursing home chains that cluster their unbranded units are able to achieve higher quality, conditional on labor inputs and patient characteristics.  The clustering effect is concentrated on reductions in minor or potential code violations, which are difficult to observe without close monitoring.  Additional tests reject organizational learning as an explanation for these results, leaving improved monitoring and supervision as the most plausible explanation of our findings.",clustering| monitoring| operational efficiency

Higher order profit enhancing goals and objectives typically supersede other non-profit enhancing goals such as environmental performance; therefore, I claim that profit enhancing goals and objectives drive environmental performance through secondary affects.

However, business responses to climate change continue within a discourse of traditional rationality in which emotion is discouraged and seen as an impediment to effective analysis and decision-making. In this paper we explore the role of emotions and the process of emotionality in terms of how managers and their organizations are responding to climate change. Through analysis of qualitative data from major Australian corporations, we distinguish between not only the ways in which emotions are constrained and encouraged within business organizations undertaking pro-environmental activities, but also how emotions are expressed and managed by both individuals and organizations. We distinguish four forms of emotionality evident in the business response to climate change; control, calculation, conversion and commitment. In contrast to earlier research on corporate greening we find significant emotional engagement by managers with the issue of environmental sustainability. We argue that the increasing prominence of climate change as a pressing business and personal concern has opened up new space for the authentic expression of emotions at work. Our paper also highlights the need to view emotionality as a dialectical phenomena, in that while organizations can seek to constrain and encourage emotional expression by employees, so too employees can use emotion to challenge and shape organizational practices and processes.",emotion| climate change| chnage agency

Certification programs have been studied as a mechanism for producers to communicate unobservable organizational attributes to exchange parties.  Such signals convey information about a producers environmental and labor practices, so that buyers/consumers factor them into their purchasing decisions.  Previous research on self-regulation has focused on whether firms adopt a single certification; however, the effects of having multiple certification programs competing in an industry are not yet understood.  I extend our understanding of self-regulation by analyzing how managers choose among various certification programs with different characteristics and deployed via different strategies.  This exploratory analysis suggests that signaling theory might not suffice to explain producers certification choice.  Other characteristics such as the promotion strategies of the certifying organizations and firms social connections seem to be influencing producers decisions.  Results also suggest that industries with competing certification programs might face a race to the bottom, where certifying organizations decrease the stringency of their standard and focus their efforts on marketing in order to increase their adoption by firms.  This unanticipated outcome is, in part, a result of consumers being unable to distinguish the quality of certifications.",self-regulation| voluntary environmental program| ecolabels

More specifically, we investigate how a firms key capabilities contribute to process compliance management activities (e.g., supplier development or auditing), ultimately achieving value chain partners compliance with the VSS.We run our exploratory research based on six comparative case studies within the retail, paper, medical textile, and information technology industry. Thereby, the research integrates theories of institutional entrepreneurship and the (contingent) resource-based view. While the first theory explains how companies can drive institutional change, the latter outlines criteria for organizational capabilities which enable the focal firm, i.e. the institutional entrepreneur, to achieve the targeted institutional change.Our analysis suggests five key capabilities enabling the focal firm to effectively implement the VSS in its value chain that is reflected by suppliers and sub-suppliers compliance with the previously defined VSS: (1) inter-firm dialogue, (2) risk management, (3) external stakeholder collaboration, (4) cross-functional integration, and (5) continuous improvement. Hereby, our research suggests that firms capabilities might be contingent on the prevailing power relationship between the firm and its suppliers. Furthermore, we propose that suppliers capabilities themselves have a positive effect on other value chain partners compliance with firms issued VSS.Resulting from our research, the organizational key capabilities identified might extend the theory of institutional entrepreneurship with concepts that facilitate the institutional change in value chains with respect to corporate sustainability.",compliance| voluntary sustainability standards| value chains

By integrating the Natural Resource Based View and Quality Signalling Theory, we argue that the firms strategic position is the critical element to understand why quality disclosure varies among companies. In particular, we defend that firms tend to disclose quality information when they allocate more resources in sustainable development strategies. Applying the principles that underline the concept of sustainable development to the firm level, we identify three types of sustainable development strategies that affect the quality of reporting. These are environmental integrity, economic prosperity and social equity. To test our hypotheses, we use a hierarchical model of disclosure on sustainability, computing three reporting indices: environmental, safety & health and human rights. We construct each index, using a hand-collected set of specific items identified previously in the literature. These items are extracted from the reports using as a primary tool the content analysis. We assess the level of detail in which firms reported. We test our hypotheses in the automobile industry for the period between 2000 and 2007. A total of 140 reports for 20 automobile companies were examined. Our results suggest that companies allocating a high proportion of resources promoting environmental integrity and social equity achieve the second level of disclosure on sustainability. However, the empirical evidences do not support that companies that allocate a high proportion of resources in promoting economic prosperity achieve the third level of disclosure on sustainability.",quality disclosure| sustainable development strategies| automobile industry

We have connected the literature on sustainability transitions to the body of literature on entrepreneurship and the strategic behaviour of firms. As a first step we have analyzed how strategies are conceptualized in the two main approaches in the sustainability transitions literature. Three main observations can be made: (1) Both approaches do not pay much attention to the emergence of novelty in the form of new technologies and entrepreneurs developing these technologies but assume the presence of a technology as the starting point of the analysis, (2) Both approaches focus on processes rather than strategies. (3) Not all kinds of interactions are taken into account; more specifically the role of competing technologies is not clearly conceptualized. We provide a literature overview that addresses how these strategies are conceptualized in the business literature.This link between entrepreneurial and incumbent strategies on the one hand and the literature on sustainability transitions on the other are a first step in understanding the micro-foundations of sustainability transitions.",sustainability transitions| incumbents| green entrepreneurship

We also find evidence of significant vertical entry spillovers a FDI in downstream (upstream) industries initiates entry in upstream (downstream) sectors via the presence of backward (forward) linkages. Our results also show that entry spillovers through forward linkages dominate both horizontal spillovers and spillovers through backward linkages. However, the spillovers vary substantially across industries: while service industries benefit from both horizontal and vertical spillovers, manufacturing industries do not experience significant positive entry spillovers of any kind.

In this paper we trace and analyze the 167-year history of collaborative leadership processes in the TMTs of a religious organization (The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints).  We delineate the collaborative leadership structure put in place by Joseph Smith in 1844 in a TMT, and describe the process by which it was preserved in the TMTs in the church across the 20th century to the present.  Based on our findings, we derive implications from this churchs experience with TMT collaborative leadership governance for the socialization, transmission, and maintenance of collaborative leadership processes for TMTs in organizations today.",top management teams| collaborative leadership| joseph smith

It first groups risk theories into narrow technocratic and broader critical/skeptical views and then constructs seven categories for the latter: (i) heroic firefighting, (ii) system accidents, (iii) high reliability and mindfulness, (iv) cultural theory of risk, (v) governmentality and normalization, (vi) risk society, and (vii) the new conservatism. Each category is a major theme around which there are many variations. All together, the paper uses this eight-category scheme as a roadmap for discussion of managing risk in contemporary societies for two purposes. First, it clarifies the current state of a complex literature, explores core contributions and the prevailing tendencies, and briefly examines limitations in each category. Second, the paper contends that, at the end of the day, despite their different perspectives on risk management, proponents of technocratic and critical/skeptical views hold one key assumption in common a to develop a practical framework for the reflective (not knee-jerk reflex type) practice of risk management under conditions of uncertainty, one that has been subjected to systematic critique by broader views. The broader critical views do not provide a coherent practical framework but they set the stage for such an attempt. The paper calls for a more detailed examination and elaboration of the nature of Knightian uncertainty, and its importance as a decisive factor for formulating a practical approach for the reflective practice of risk management.",risk| uncertainty| risk management

Relying on a set of different assumptions, rational negotiation scholars use a top-down approach to constructing theories whereas behavioral negotiation scholars use a bottom-up approach.

A challenge in these settings pertains to the need to share skilled resources across concurrent projects especially when project management is schedule-driven. To probe into this problem, we use a system dynamics simulation grounded on in-depth fieldwork with a high-performance truck developer. We simulate the effects of capturing resources allocated originally to one project so as to speed up another project that started late. Our central contribution is to illuminate how schedule-driven project management can lead to a vicious cycle that degrades the long-term performance of the multi-project organization. Whilst capturing resources can ensure that a tardy but business-critical project is delivered on time, if the organizations resource capacity is fixed, this practice delays other projects unless they can also capture enough resources. But as staff switches back and forth between projects frequently, productivity deteriorates and the organizations performance becomes irremediably degraded.",multi-projects| schedule-driven management| simulation

Based on this, we secondly measure to which extent different middle management actors are involved in PPM. Finally, we analyze how the involvement of the different actors affects portfolio performance. Derived from organizational control theory, our study uncovers the involvement of line managers as the critical component for the effectiveness of task execution in PPM. Building on multiple informants we further find a negative moderating impact of the degree of line managers involvement on the relationship between task execution and performance. This is surprising as literature generally outlines PPM as an explicit work for middle managers. Building on our findings, we argue that it is at least as much important WHO is involved in PPM as WHAT tasks are executed. Hence, we specifically plead for a more differentiated examination of middle management roles in future PPM research.",project portfolio management| middle management| organizational control

The study deploys rich quantitative and qualitative data sets by combining 108 government reports with 38 interviews. Preliminary conclusions suggest that as a response to the need to be competitive the solutions provider unbundles the bundle of integrated solutions by creating sub-units to handle distinct phases. The work highlights preliminary evidence for the PPP approach appearing to have disjointed objectives of bundling, risk transfer and innovation in immature markets. The paper questions whether bundling the different management and procurement phases of a major project into one contract is appropriate. Managers must weigh the transactional cost savings of dealing with a prime contractor against not only the transactional costs of dealing with distinct contractors for individual phases, but also the comparative ability of the two options to deliver. This study adds to the limited empirical understanding on the nature of long-term public-private interactions in integrated solutions provision and the emerging literature on public-private organizational change.

Yet, the exact mechanisms that lead to the optimum supply chain integration configuration and subsequently to improved performance remain ambiguous.  In this paper we use qualitative data from 70 manufacturers collected as part of the UKs manufacturing excellence awards, to argue that the configuration of supply chain integration is determined by a products newness and the manufacturers main process structure.  We define four key supply chain configurations based on these dimensions: bespoke integration; ramp up integration; recurring integration; and coordinated integration.  We discuss the implications of our findings and argue that future studies on supply chain integration should be more fine-grained to control for the variation in the configuration we report.

Consistent with technology acceptance models, the benefits from healthcare information technology (HIT) and related analyses are found to progress from adoption, to integration, to use.  However, we find that the integration of hospital information technology systems may not directly impact quality performance or patient outcomes.  Instead, the results indicate that the analysis of information for organizational decision making mediates the impact of systems adoption and integration on quality and patient satisfaction.  Additionally, we concurrently consider the relationship of the analysis of medical error data and the analysis of organizational data and their impacts on hospital performance outcomes.  The findings show a significant association between organizational-level data analysis and floor-level error data analysis but suggest that cultures that emphasize error data analysis may not directly impact care quality and patient satisfaction outcomes contrary to popular thinking.  The results are supported by analyses of a novel combination of three main sources of primary and secondary data:  information systems adoption data from the HIMMS database, survey data on information systems and error data analysis from 250 hospitals throughout the United States, and publicly reported hospital quality and satisfaction data.

Furthermore, we show that it is the high quality firms most valuable customers, those with the longest tenure, most products, and highest balances, who are the most vulnerable to superior service alternatives.  Along the way, we also show that firms trade-off price and service quality and that customers of firms offering relatively low service quality are susceptible to the entry or expansion of inferior service (price) competitors.

This paper outlines how the introduction of informed operations practices in industrial field services operations are valuable both directly, in terms of the immediate benefits of tracked instances, and also in terms of improved learning and standardization at the service system level. The findings are based on a systematic review of transcribed interviews from an exploratory field study of the use of, and need for, installed base information systems. Interviews were conducted with 111 knowledgeable informants in the industrial field services, supply chain management, product development, and general management operations of five original equipment manufacturers. Informed operations is introduced as a mode complementary to standardized operations in the context of industrial field services operations. The paper shows how informed operations increases value in contexts in which variability reduction and standardized operations are insufficient by conferring the ability to rationally shift operations between standardized and customized process so as to increase the reuse of skills, designs, processes, and instances.

Despite the widespread uptake of servitization, questions remain regarding the nature of servitization trajectories and the impact of servitization on various aspects of performance. To answer these questions, we investigate performance effects of core dimensions of servitization: investments in service business and service market exploitation, in terms of breadth and depth of service offering. First results suggest that tangible service investments- though often underestimated by manufacturers- represent a prerequisite for growth. With respect to profit performance, we find that increasing service breadth, measured in number of services offered, puts downward pressure on margins, while increasing service depth, measured in completeness of service offering, results in higher margins and an increase in market value. Furthermore, completeness of service offering has a positive effect on market value as well. Nevertheless, positive effect of completeness on performance, especially with respect to market value, does come at a certain price; the impact of the interdependence between product innovation investments and service completeness turns from positive to negative when highest level of service completeness is present. It seems that manufacturer has to either decide to limit his aspirations to moderate levels of service completeness, where service offering remains product-focused (e.g. total maintenance solution) or give up his product innovation strategy and fully focus on complete service solutions, rich in knowledge intensive services (e.g. consulting). Attempting to spread the competence base over full spectrum of product and service offerings may result in a loss of profitability as well as market value.",servitization| performance| service

This paper investigates whether and to what extent different LCCS objectives have an influence on consensus in cross-functional LCCS teams between purchasing and non-purchasing staff and how the deviation from the consensus within a LCCS team impacts the LCCS performance of their specific project.We use an explorative case study approach using qualitative research data from workshops to de-velop a LCCS consensus model and combine it with a survey-based study of multiple respon-dents of 23 teams to evaluate the identified relationships within our consensus model with quan-titative data and evaluate the relationships between the antecedents and outcomes of consensus within LCCS project teams. LCCS objectives and team consensus as well as team consensus and LCCS performance out-comes are strongly correlated. The deviation direction from team consensus changes depending on the chosen LCCS strategy. Moreover, negative deviation from team consensus, implying a more positive evaluation of the project management areas by the non-purchasing staff as com-pared to the purchasing staff, is associated with better LCCS project performance outcomes. A positive deviation from team consensus is shown to be correlated with worse LCCS project per-formance outcomes as compared to full team consensus.",low-cost country sourcing| consensus| cross-functional teams

Utilizing a sample (N=136) of global leaders of a well-known multinational, it was found that personal (languages, international business experience), psychological (level of psychological capital) and role complexity (level of management and type of experience) antecedents were related to the participants level of global mindset as measured by cultural intelligence and global business orientation.",global mindset| global leadership| antecedents

Using data from business school students in both mono- (n=133) and multi-cultural (n=112) contexts, the hypothesized relationship was supported. In a mono-cultural context, individuals are more likely to emerge as informal group leaders when they are high in brokerage centrality in either their advice or friendship social networks. In a multi-cultural context, by contrast, individuals need to be high in both advice brokerage centrality and CQ in order to successfully emerge as informal group leaders. Individuals whose CQ is higher than their advice brokerage centrality are more likely to emerge as group leaders than those whose CQ is lower. Implications for leadership research in multi-cultural contexts were discussed.",cultural intelligence| brokerage centrality| leadership

An empirical study was conducted to explore dissatisfied employees likelihood of retaliation through negative word-of-mouth using electronic modes of communication across generations. Based on a survey of 206 individuals, the findings support the notion that employees from younger generations are more likely to use electronic modes of communication, when spreading nWOM, than their predecessors. There was also moderate support suggesting that the younger the worker, the more likely they are to broadcast their opinions publically via commonly used social networking sites.

This moderated mediation model was tested with a sample of 283 Korean employees. Results showed that, among the three types of justices, the effects of distributive and interactional justice on OCB were mediated by OI. Additionally, we found the positive relationship between OI and OCB was stronger for both a low level of transactional and a high level of relational contract.

These topics were approached from a generational context as a new generation of employees is entering the workplace with a reportedly different approach to work. The hospitality industry has traditionally hosted a relatively young workforce, exposing it to this new generational context before other industries. Data were collected through face-to-face surveys on site from a sample (N=111) in seven hotels of an international hotel chain. Findings provide evidence of generational differences in the content of the psychological contract, as well as the process through which the psychological contract impacts organizational citizenship behavior.

To begin to integrate the literature, we conducted a grounded theory study in which we recorded, transcribed, and coded interview responses from 46 working adults regarding their experiences with colleagues they deemed to be difficult. Analysis of their responses yielded the following definition: difficult colleagues are those individuals (a) with whom one comes into regular contact in the workplace (including clients and employees of partner firms); (b) about whom there is some consensus among others that the person creates problems at work, because (c) they have a detrimental impact on ones own or ones units performance, and (d) they repeatedly violate normative standards of workplace behavior.  Six clusters of behavioral norm violations emerged: (a) interpersonal behavior; (b) communication; (c) control of information or work tasks; (d) emotional self-regulation; (e) self-interest; and (f) work quality.

This paper argues that the experience of bystanders is an area that warrants additional attention from organizational researchers.  Empirical evidence pertinent to bystanders is scant in the literature, but the findings to date suggest that the majority of individuals who witness workplace bullying behavior are not immune to its detrimental effects.  The underlying premise of this paper is that bullying behavior in the work environment is a threat to bystanders (as well as targets and the entire organization).  A conceptual model is proposed to further understanding of individual differences that may differentiate bystanders who speak up when they perceive bullying behavior from those who do not.  The cognitive-transactional stress theory, self-verification theory, and self-determination theory are used as theoretical frameworks.  Several implications for theory and practice are discussed.",bystanders| voice behavior| workplace bullying

This paper calls these assumptions into question and redefines employee voice to be reflective of verbal or written behavior that presents innovative suggestions or complaints to management with the intention of improving the status quo.  The essence of employee voice is promoting innovative ideas for change.  A conceptual map of the voice domain includes four important dimensions including: motive (prosocial/instrumental), content (suggestion/complaint), media (verbal/written), and method (individual/collective).  Each of these dimensions is explored in detail along with the impact of dispositional moderators of organization commitment and personality, situational moderators of organizational culture and LMX, and performance evaluations as an outcome measure.",employee voice| citizenship| innovation

However, organizational identification only reflects one part of how workers' organizational memberships are related to their sense of self and not all new organizational forms support the cognitive processes underlying organizational identification to the same degree as traditional organizations. In this paper we build on recent developments in social psychology that include feelings of pride and respect as essential elements of social identity in order to better understand how people relate to their work organizations. Examining this broader conceptualization of social identity processes in a non-traditional organizational form, we find that pride and perceived respect, and not organizational identification, are related to both in-role and extra-role behavior.

However, studies of groups involved in the creative act suggest that highly creative groups do not always follow this process. In this paper, we present an inductive, qualitative process analysis of twenty of the meetings of four healthcare policy groups tasked with producing creative output. We find that the groups use four different processes to generate creative output  brainstorming, sequential processing, parallel processing, and iterative processing. We propose that an iterative process, in which groups cycle back and forth between ideas over time, refining and evaluating them, facilitates collective engagement in the group task, and we link this process to creativity. This challenges the brainstorming model of group creativity, and suggests that idea generation and idea selection can be productively integrated in the creative process in groups.",creativity| groups| qualitative

However, previous creativity researches related to job characteristics have been predominately focused on exploring complex jobs in professional (particularly R&D) fields. Surprisingly, little attention has been paid to the potential effects of routinized activities on creativity in more diverse fields of work. Thus, in an effort to discuss how routinization might be associated with creativity, this study defined the different characteristics of routinization, and considered free cognitive resources as a possible mediating mechanism underlying the routinization-creativity relationships within the extension of skill acquisition and information processing theories. For further explanation of what makes employees allocate their spare cognitive resources to seeking new approaches to work, learning goal orientation and sufficient resources (job level factor) are chosen as predictors of the free cognitive resources-creativity relation. With data from two different job types, White and Blue-collar workers, this study goes beyond previous findings to present empirical evidence that routinization is positively - and not negatively, as was often assumed - related to creativity through the mediating role of psychological mechanism.

1580,,1|The Role of Supervisor and Network Ties in Newcomers' In-Role and Extra-Role Performance,1|Markku Jokisaari|Finnish Institute of Occupational Health||,,"Many scholars of organizational socialization have argued that the interaction between newcomers and more experienced members in the organization is a main channel for newcomers to learn their roles in the organization. In similar lines, leader-member exchange (LMX) theory argues for the importance of supervisors in newcomers' role performance. In addition, the social network approach proposes that the structure and content of the newcomers' network of informal contacts contribute to the newcomers' performance in the job. However, scholars have not yet investigated how both the newcomers' supervisor and network relations are related to the newcomers' role performance. Thus, this paper examined how the newcomers' supervisor (LMX) and network relationships (network density, strength of ties) related to their role performances during organizational entry. A sample of new employees completed questionnaires which included social network and LMX measures. Their supervisors rated their in-role (job, work group member) and extra-role (organization member) performances. The results showed that the structure of the newcomers' networks (i.e., sparse networks) related to supervisor-rated job performance, and newcomers' networks characterized by strong ties related to their work-group behavior. Finally, the results showed that the quality of the newcomers' supervisor relations (LMX) related to their extra-role performance.",organizational socialization| role behavior| social networks

Although research in social psychology has considered the decision calculus and other factors that precipitate the choice to participate in a collective act, it has yet to consider the role of individual differences in predicting a persons propensity to join (e.g., C.

This paper seeks to fill a gap in the research by recognizing the individuals role in group level action and attempts to build theory on the micro-underpinnings of organizational phenomena.

In this paper, we identify the helping process and the ways in which helping contributes to the coordination of work.  We show that helping is an essential process underlying emergent coordination by demonstrating that helping aids the resolution of problems based on both interdependencies and what we term asymmetric dependencies  dependencies that are non-reciprocal. Drawing on these findings, we develop a framework for how helping behavior constitutes an important part of coordination in modern knowledge-intensive organizations.",coordination| helping| dependencies

Previous research demonstrated that overall justice mediates the relationship between facet measures of justice and outcomes (Ambrose and Schminke, 2009) and that justice anticipations impact employees' reactions to change (Rodell and Colquitt, 2009). Our paper builds on these seminal works to extend them in two ways: 1) we explore the mediating role of overall justice at an event-level in a change context and 2) we explore anticipations of justice. We hypothesized that the concept of overall justice was distinct from justice facets in an anticipatory context and that anticipatory overall justice of the change (AOJC) partially mediated the relationship between specific anticipatory justice perceptions and outcomes, and that anticipatory procedural justice (APJ) was the strongest antecedent of both anticipatory overall justice perceptions of the change and outcome. Based on an empirical study carried out during the early phase of a merger, our results support the construct validity of AOJC and to the primacy role of APJ.

The Role of Group-Level Justice on Individual Reactions to Injustice,1|Yumi Seo|Cornell U.||,,"The present research posits that individuals in a group use group-level justice as a reference point for their own evaluation of unfair events. While group- level justice is achieved through sensemaking and social influence (Roberson & Colquitt, 2005), it also works as a standard for individuals to make fairness judgments, so that individual members' affective and behavioral reactions are affected by pre-existing team justice in a group. Developed from referent cognition theory, fairness theory (Folger & Cropanzano, 2001) posits that individuals evaluate behaviors based on counterfactual thinking, generating alternatives about what would have happened if the behavior had not occurred, whether the perpetrator could have behaved differently, and whether the perpetrator should have behaved the way he or she did. In the present research, group-level justice climate provides a strong basis for this line of thinking. Since perceptions of unfairness intensify in situations where the perpetrator could have avoided an injustice but did not, affective reactions following an experience of injustice will vary by group-level justice climate. Therefore, the present research explores this link between group-level justice and individual-level reactions. Building on the affective events theory framework (Weiss & Cropanzano, 1996) and justice and emotion literature, the role of group- level justice in shaping affective and behavioral reactions to work events is examined.",justice| emotion| teamjustice

Whilst extensive research has focused on the dark side of individual reactions to an injustice (such as retaliation, sabotage, theft), there has been a paucity of research examining reactions that do not culminate in negative implications for the individual or the organization.  This paper seeks to fill this gap by introducing a model of talking as a victim-centered intervention, and asserting propositions that explain the chain of events leading from the perception of a workplace injustice through to the outcomes that this phenomenon affords victims, assisting them with recovery from the effects of an injustice.  Nesting the talking phenomenon within a theoretical paradigm that draws on dissonance theory and attachment theory respectively, it is argued that a workplace injustice triggers a state of cognitive and emotional dissonance which in turn activates the search for an attachment figure (a significant, supportive other) with whom social contact is sought, followed by talking.   It is argued that two components of talk, namely emotion and cognition, lead to separate socio-affective and meaning related outcomes; together, they lead to recovery which is the alleviation of the memory of a negative experience, as well as a sense of closure for the victim and reduced retaliatory intentions. This paper seeks to give voice to the victims of injustice by proposing that victims can take an active and constructive role in their recovery, which does not accrue costs for themselves or their workplace.",injustice| victim| talking

Finally, although intrinsically motivated individuals were less likely to be exhausted in general, the salutary effects of intrinsic motivation were reduced when pre-work exhaustion was high.

The results reveal that, among employees who have not taken short-term sick leaves in the previous year, the perception of a well-articulated organizational vision and the belief that the organization places importance on values of quality and innovation moderate the relationship between burnout symptoms and prospective short-term sick leaves.

Meta-analysis was utilized to test the relationships between occupational stressors (challenge stressors and hindrance stressors) and safety outcomes.  Significant associations were found between overall job stress and involvement in workplace accidents.  In relation to safety performance, it was hypothesized that hindrance stressors would have negative effects on both safety compliance and safety participation, whilst challenge stressors would have positive effects.  The hypotheses relating to hindrance stressors were supported, suggesting that hindrance stressors lead to a significant reduction in both compliance with safety rules and participation in safety-related activities.  However, the hypotheses related to challenge stressors and safety performance were not supported.  Challenge stressors had a non-significant, near-zero association with safety compliance, and a significant negative association with safety participation.  These findings would suggest that the motivational effects of challenge stressors are insufficient to cancel out the negative effects of these stressors in terms of anxiety and strain.  The theoretical and practical implications of the meta-analytic findings are discussed, as well as avenues for further research.",occupational stress| safety behavior| accidents

Testing different models showed a full mediation model was superior, with POSC predicted POS, which in turn predicted outcomes with collectivism. In addition, the potential moderation effects of collectivism were tested and results indicated that those individuals with higher levels of POSC and higher levels of collectivism had higher job and career satisfaction.

At the same time, employees face considerable work pressure, which might undermine their creativity. This paper theoretically integrates various theoretical perspectives (e.g., the job demands-resources model, dual pathway to creativity model and appraisal theories of job stress) with functional approaches to leadership to develop a new conceptual model of the effects of pressure on creativity in which leadership behavior plays a key moderating role. Our Pressure-Leadership-Interaction model proposes a double-mediated process in which experiences of pressure trigger either a challenge or a threat appraisal which, in turn, influences creativity by shaping employees cognitive flexibility or persistence, respectively. Further, we cast leadership as a key moderator for the linkages between pressure and challenge/threat appraisals (viz., appraisal function of leadership), on the one hand, and between such appraisals and cognitive flexibility/persistence (viz., catalyst and buffer functions of leadership), on the other. We outline several specific leadership behaviors that may serve these functions. The resulting model leads to a number of testable propositions, and it contributes to a better understanding of the pressure-creativity relationship by explicating, in an integrative manner, both generative mechanisms and boundary conditions underlying this linkage.

Despite this common assumption, the organizing properties of leadership has not yet been clarified or empirically demonstrated. In this study such organizing properties are shown through a detailed analysis of one single work episode, drawn from an ethnographically inspired study of leadership in a bank. Based on conversation analytic methodology, the analysis focus on interpersonal influence processes that enables and facilitates an organizing process. The results show that leadership sets this process in motion through opening and keeping an issue open; enabling emergence of a new interpretation of the task at hand; and through construction of a situated task-based social identity, within which future actions are constructed and committed to. This extends existing theories of organizing by showing not only accomplishment of, but also resistance to, closures as an important organizing property of leadership. The results also suggest that interdependencies, as the core of an organizing process, might be constructed between identities as well as between behaviors and roles. Further, the results add to the understanding of identity in relation to leadership and organizing by showing the influence as well as organizing function of situated social, as opposed to individual, identities-in-interaction.Paper is No Longer Available Online: Please contact the author(s).This study examined the psychological processes that might underlie the relationship between charismatic leadership and individual- and group-level multi-focal organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs).

In addition, although intergroup contexts may increase the value of representativeness, we predict that vision dominates representativeness in determining leader emergence and effectiveness for single-group situations characterized by high levels of collective stress (e.g., a natural disaster). Five studies demonstrated that visionary leaders (i.e., those who offer novel solutions to their groups predicament) attract more followers, promote group identification and intrinsic motivation, mobilize collective action, and effectively regulate group members emotions and reactions to crisis more than prototypical leaders.

Accordingly, whenever the leadership perceptions of an individual do not conform (i.e., they are hierarchically inconsistent) with those of other group members, he/she is induced to reduce such inconsistencies by aligning his/her own leadership perceptions.

Because older age is one possible prerequisite of status and power, it is important to understand which leadership behaviors are successful when the supervisor is younger than the team. While previous research has shown that transformational leadership is effective for older leaders, we propose that relatively younger leaders will need to show contingent reward behaviors to effectively influence their team. We tested this idea in a sample of 96 teams from the customer service industry focusing on (in)voluntary turnover of the team members. Results showed that when the team leader was markedly younger and levels of contingent reward were low, voluntary turnover was higher. By contrast, in case of high contingent reward leadership, relatively younger leader age was associated with higher involuntary turnover. Both effects were mediated by the teams' satisfaction with their leaders. These findings point to the importance of adapting leadership behaviors that fit the challenges of relatively younger leaders who are leading older teams.",contingent reward leadership| leader age| team member turnover

The curvilinear relationship between group efficacy and performance was hypothesized and tested using two different samples of 35 and 56 real-life teams in different organizational settings. Results demonstrated that group efficacy had an inverted U-shape relationship with performance. Furthermore, group cohesiveness had moderating effects on the curvilinear efficacy-performance relationships in both samples.",group efficacy| group performance| group cohesiveness

By undertaking a pluralist reading of compensation phenomena from Marxian, managerial and post structural theoretical viewpoints, nine variables are formulated to propose a process view of compensation. Compensation governance contexts are constituted by executive perceptions of economy, competition and adaptation to market changes. This influences compensation governance components constituted by finance, performance linked pay and strategic HRM practices. This influences compensation governance outcomes constituted by executive satisfaction with material needs and organizational practices, and executive adoption of instrumental orientations. This study uses structural equation modeling to test the proposed hypotheses. The results are discussed from the perspective of the conditions, nature and limits of organizational collectives emerging from choices made regarding compensation governance contexts and components.",compensation| governance| structural equation modeling

Since the committee members, as well as the chairperson, show mimetic behavior when they make a decision on the executive pay structure, we propose that executive pay dispersion be diffused across firms through the mechanism of the compensation committee; this is based on the social influence perspective.  In addition, we propose that the strength of diffusion be greater when the compensation committee members gain longer tenure.  We found general support for the diffusion of pay dispersion.  When we used only base salary for the analysis, the pay dispersion of the compensation committee members!- tied firm is associated with that of the focal firm.  In addition, the tenure moderates the strength of diffusion, where longer tenure of the compensation committee members, as well as the chairperson, leads to a stronger diffusion of executive pay dispersion.  This discussion on the executive pay dispersion opens up a new perspective on the role of the compensation committee as the catalyst in the diffusion of executive pay dispersion across firms.",pay dispersion| compensation committee| executive compensation

Yet, empirical studies have been ambiguous about the directionality of the effect. We develop a comprehensive framework that assesses the effects of two distinct types of CEO pay standing; the pay standing of CEOs relative to their top management team members (internal pay standing) and relative to their peers in the industry (external pay standing). Using 14 years of executive compensation data and up to four subsequent years of firm performance, we find that while a CEOs internal pay standing is unrelated to firm performance, external pay standing is negatively related to market-based firm performance measures in the long-run. Furthermore, external pay standing is associated with actions that are likely to reinforce a CEOs high external pay standing (i.e., earnings management and mergers and acquisitions), which also mediate some of external pay standing-firm performance relationships.",ceo compensation| pay comparisons| pay standing

Based on the analysis of a sample of 260 family firms and a sample of 265 non-family firms over a ten year period (1998 to 2007), empirical results indicate that workforce downsizing is positively associated with longer term firm accounting performance, but negatively associated with short-term firm capital market performance for both family and non-family firms. While the disparate relationship between workforce downsizing and firm accounting/capital market performance is consistent across both samples of family and non-family firms, empirical tests further reveal that effect sizes are significantly stronger for family firms than for non-family firms.  Furthermore, we find that firm performance and firm leverage - two measures of firm financial distress - moderate the relationship between workforce downsizing and firm performance. In sum, results thus contribute to extant research on workforce downsizing by suggesting that workforce downsizing may have disparate influences on short term and long term firm performance and by highlighting that the strength of this influence differs depending on firm ownership structure (i.e. family vs. non-family firm).",workforce downsizing| family ownership

This occurs due to a combination of beneficial effects of knowledge-transfer and a state of competitive arousal driven by perceived pressures for proving their loyalty to the recipient organization, scrutiny of their performance during the event, and occasionally by anger and a desire to extract revenge against their prior employer. This paper elaborates theory by moving beyond a singular focus on knowledge-transfer during employee mobility and drawing attention to the complementary role of cognitive factors.

We collected data from full-time employees (N = 215) at Time 1 and followed up with them after 12 months (N = 67) to inquire about their employment status. Consistent with the theoretical predictions, the results of structural equation modeling based analyses demonstrated that overqualified employees enact externally-oriented career behaviors such as mobility and refrain from furthering their careers inside the organization. Managers respond to these career self-management behaviors by suspending organizational career help, which, in turn, exacerbate voluntary turnover of overqualified employees.",overqualification| career| voluntary turnover

We suggest that the simple measures used in peer assessment (in-degree centrality) do not capture the complexity of the social reality and are therefore limited in their predictive validity power. Using a longitudinal research design, we compared the validity of the existing measures with other, more complex measures derived from social network analysis (i.e., egocentric network density and reciprocity). A sample of 249 soldiers, divided into 18 groups, assessed each other at the end of a selection process for an elite military unit on two networks: friendship and instrumental contribution to the team. Commanders from the unit also interviewed the soldiers and provided a supervisory assessment of their ability to succeed in the unit. In addition, more than six months later, the commanders of the 132 soldiers that were selected to the unit provided evaluations of their performance on three dimensions: performance under stress, engagement, and leadership. We found that while in real-time, supervisor assessment was strongly related to in-degree centrality, it did not predict performance longitudinally. However, the new more complex measures did predict performance: Non-reciprocity predicted all three dimensions of future performance in the friendship assessment measure, and a combination of egocentric network density with in-degree centrality predicted future performance in the assessment measure for contribution to the group (in both networks).

This paper models the diffusion of the practice of shareholding through Kenyan society as a process of social contagion, with social networks carrying information about profitability of previous investments from current to potential investors. I create a unique, individual-level database showing the timing of first share purchase and town of residence for 83% of all Kenyan investors, estimating how potential investors react to positive profits earned by geographically proximate previous adopters and how levels of ethnic homogeneity among distinct tribal groups in each town enhances or retards the townas susceptibility to the social contagion process. After controlling for IPO-specific effects and underlying traits of each town, I find strong evidence of a contagion process, with potential investors reacting positively to profits earned in previous periods by other in the network.  Susceptibility to this contagion process, however, is strongly mitigated in ethnically homogeneous towns. A secondary analysis finds that town-level exposure to IPO advertising campaigns produces a similar effect of reducing town-level susceptibility to network contagion.

For our theoretical foundation, we build on the heterogeneous diffusion model of social influence from the sociology literature. We characterize specific open source licenses as discrete practices that are at risk of being adopted by new open source projects. Specific hypotheses are proposed and tested on a sample of 5,307 open source projects hosted at SourceForge. Our findings suggest the likelihood a new OSS project adopts a particular license type increases with the number of OSS projects in the managers social network that had previously adopted such a license. Moreover, we find that prior adopters of a particular license are more infectious in their influence on the license choice of a new project as their size and performance rankings increase. We also find that managers of new projects who have been members of relatively successful prior OSS projects and who have greater depth and diversity of experience in the OSS community are less susceptible to social influence. Finally, we find a project manager is more likely to adopt a particular license type when her project is more socially proximate to other projects that have adopted the same license. Beyond contributing to OSS research, these results have implications for research on economic governance and innovation diffusion.",open source software license| social networks| adoption and diffusion

Using unique data on mutual fund foundings between 1979 and 2005, I examine whether organizational size and age, typically associated with lower rates of entrepreneurial activity, also lead to lower individual rates of intrapreneurship. Findings show that, while organizational size and age reduce the rate of entrepreneurship, individual rates of intrapreneurship increase for larger and older organizations. The results suggest that the negative association between large and old organizations and entrepreneurship arises due to high rates of intrapreneurship and that the stifling influence of large and old organizations on an employees propensity to enter entrepreneurship matters far more than has been generally assumed. More broadly, the study emphasizes the need to incorporate the competing alternative of intrapreneurship into the extant models of entrepreneurship.",entrepreneurship| organizations| bureaucracy

We argue that centrality in the networks of outward personnel mobility, resulting from employees leaving firms, can have both positive effects on firms creative performance by facilitating access to heterogeneous information and by enhancing legitimacy of the firms creative ideas, and negative effects due to disruptions to firms operations. This produces an inverted U-shaped relationship between a firms centrality in a network of personnel outflows and its creative performance. We also conjecture that this relationship is moderated by a firms centrality in a network of inward personnel mobility, a firms age, and its status. Analyses of a unique longitudinal dataset containing information about career mobility of designers across fashion houses and creative performance of these houses between 2000 and 2010 support our predictions.",mobility| networks| fashion industry

Departing from prior research, we explore the role of midrange effects that result from firms membership in network communities. Network communities are defined as dense structural groups within the network in which actors are connected more to each other than to other actors in the system. Focusing on firms innovation performance, we first highlight the role of the structural characteristics of network communities, such as their size and centrality in the global network architecture, as well as the role of community membership dynamics. By shaping the scope and diversity of the communitys knowledge base, these features can significantly affect the resident firms innovation potential. We then explore the role of a firms movement across communities in determining its exposure to diverse and heterogeneous knowledge inputs. Our findings suggest that larger and more centrally positioned communities enable resident firms to innovate at a higher rate. We further find that the level of membership turnover in a firms community and the extent of a firms movement across different communities affect its innovation rate in an inverse curvilinear pattern, wherein the firm reaps the greatest innovation benefits at moderate levels of membership turnover and community hopping. Our empirical analyses use the evolving community structure of a network of interorganizational partnerships in the global computer industry over 1985-2001 to predict computer firms patenting rates.",partnerships| networks| community

However, despite major consistent efforts, very few globally successful ICT clusters have emerged in the United States in the last three decades. Most economic developers and policymakers believe this is the result of not deciphering the genetic code of Silicon Valley. We disagree. We argue that the true puzzle is the exact oppositeexplaining the almost universal failure of the best efforts led by the finest minds to achieve sustained success anywhere else within the United States. We contend that the answer lies in the fact that while attempts to develop clusters are locale-specific and each cluster is analyzed as an independent unit, they are part of an international system. Firms located in aspiring clusters must weave themselves into the communities of the more established clusters, and this long-distance embeddedness results in self-reinforcing social fragmentation of the industry in the aspiring regions. The paper elaborates on the theories of industrial clusters, focusing on social capital, networks, and embeddedness arguments, developing the logic of these arguments to fit in a world with an exceedingly dominant cluster region and hypothesize specific predictions from these models. We then offer an extensive analysis of the history of Atlanta, Georgia ICT industry as an empirical observation, to sharpen our conclusions.",innovation| clusters| networks

Rooted in the notion of inclusive capitalism, this approach argues for the simultaneous pursuit of profit and social welfare by creating markets for the poorest sections of the population. However, much reporting on BoP strategies takes the perspective of corporate actors rather than that of the community. It does not ask whether BoP projects led to capability creation within these communities. Nor does it follow up on whether particular strategies increased or decreased various types of social capital in these communities. As Amartya Sen (1985; 1999) suggests, addressing capabilities is essential if inclusive capitalism seeks to be considered a viable development model. At the same time, social capital, in particular bridging social capital increases the potential that capabilities will be created among the BoP. In this paper, we take the communitys perspective, and by drawing on seminal work on capability development and social capital, critically examine the emergence and evolution of the BoP approach. Leveraging insights from these streams of research, we suggest a more socially embedded and community-centric approach that privileges BoP empowerment without denying the pursuit of business profits.",bottom of the pyramid| social capital| capabilities

Clusters generally follow a life-cycle of emergence, growth, decline, and potential renewal. In this paper, our main focus is on cluster emergence. We emphasize Ostroms work on rule-making as a key factor in overcoming the organization problems that stand in the way of emergence, contrasting her approach to that of Williamsons transaction cost economics that has focused on governance structure. Our propositions are in the spirit of Ostroms institutional analysis and design framework that posits that the rules necessary for cluster formation relate to cluster boundaries, the allocation of costs and benefits, the resolution of conflict, monitoring and sanctioning mechanisms, mechanisms for bringing about change, and various design principles that are associated with these rules. We argue that the capacity to create the rules and to implement the design principles is a factor in cluster emergence which has not been sufficiently recognized in the prior management literature.",cluster| decentralized organization| ostrom

While we know that homophily results from both individual preference and uneven opportunity, there is little empirical research describing how these two mechanisms interact to affect the structure of intra-organizational networks.  We argue that formal organizational structure and geography delimit opportunities for interaction, but that within the constraints of business units and offices, actors have discretion to choose their interaction partners.  We further argue that women, in seeking social support from socially similar others, are more likely than men to break through these constraints.  We test these arguments using a unique dataset of organizational communication, consisting of millions of e-mails exchanged among thousands of employees in a large information technology firm.  Consistent with this theory, results show a significant interaction between the communication rates between same-sex dyads and within business unit or within office dyads.  Furthermore, we find that mens communication is consistent with homophily as discretion within constraints, but that women communicate differently: they seek out interactions with other women outside their own business unit or office, but do so through functional channels.

This analysis represents the first empirical application of Collins intriguing but heretofore untested theoretical propositions about the role of emotion in social stratification. After demonstrating how feelings of excitement and emotional energy generated in interaction serve as crucial mechanisms of candidate evaluation, I then extend Collins work by proposing a theoretical model of emotional energy development in job interviews. I highlight the mechanisms and characteristics that tend to produce, sustain, and inhibit feelings of emotional energy in interaction as well as parse out the various phases at which energy gains and losses are most consequential for influencing hiring outcomes and inequalities. I conclude by discussing the implications of my findings for both interaction ritual theory as well as recent research on organizational inequalities.",hiring| emotion| inequality

Formal and informal agendas, the aggregate sets of issues to which decision makers allocate attention and effort, prioritize amongst these multiple concerns and evolve over time.  Some issues gain more attention from organizational decision-makers, while others lose attention. I used simulation models to evaluate the role of interactions (Collins 2004) between organizational decision makers in agenda evolution. I build off of the garbage can model (Cohen, March, and Olsen 1972) to analyze the role of interactions and organizational hierarchy on attention stratification, volatility, and problem-solving.  I found that interactions lead to stratification of attention as various issues compete with each other within the simulated organizations. Higher levels of successful interactions lead to greater attention volatility and decrease total problem solving; however, interactions direct greater problem solving towards the issues that have the highest levels of attention.   Hierarchy results in more focus on the few issues that are of most interest to those leaders in the upper echelons of the organizational hierarchy.

Although status homophily hypothesis argues that firms with a similar status are more likely to associate with each other, there exists a high tendency for high-status and low-status firms to form an alliance. Extending a social exchange perspective, this study identifies several critical conditions for the exchange relationship between asymmetric partners to occur. Specifically, we move beyond implicit assumptions of status homophily by highlighting a reciprocity rule in this exchange relationship. We argue that firms are motivated to seek complementary resources from asymmetric partners and the formation of this relationship is subject to the influences of exchange contexts such as network density and technological uncertainty.

Building on the literature on embeddedness, which argues that resource flow depends on ties being either relationally or structurally embedded, we build an analytical model that incorporates the diversity and flow benefits of ties, as well as the cost of having them. The solution of the model points to instances where the expected cost savings from structural embeddedness, when combined with the benefits of enhanced flow, are material enough to direct agents to reduce the number of structural holes in their networks. We conclude that by simultaneously making use of both brokerage and cohesion together, actors can be better able to maximize their social capital. Moreover, our model enables us to draw the boundary conditions where this is possible.

Drawing on cognitive perspectives on social networks, we develop a sociocognitive model of brokerage to generate predictions about the existence of brokerage structures and brokers performance based on the variation in actors knowledge of social ties within a triad. We propose that brokers are able to occupy and profit from their position because of a knowledge asymmetry in a brokerage triad. Using organizational and classroom data on cognitive networks, we show that the probability that an actor occupies and profits from a brokerage position increases with his or her accurate knowledge of a non-tie between two alters. Conversely, brokerage structures are more likely to exist and generate higher returns when alters do not know about a tie between a broker and another alter. We further examine the mechanisms that underlie knowledge asymmetry and find that both brokers and alters rely on information derived from observation of and communication about social interactions to form their knowledge of ties. However, while brokers perceptions are reinforced by the general knowledge about an alter-alter tie held by other members of the network, alters perceptions are less likely to lead to accurate knowledge when such general knowledge increases. We attribute these differences to a constraint on alters interpretation of his or her perceptions and argue that such constraints arise as brokers act to control alters knowledge of brokerage tie.",networks| brokerage| cognition

Our findings could be peculiar to dynamic kinds of work  such as the banking studied here  but within that unknown scope condition one thing is clear: network stability has a corrosive effect on the competitive advantage typically associated with network status and access to structural holes. Volatility seen as a by-product of a banker taking risks, such as accepting a lower-status job that might lead back to an even higher-status job, or choosing to manage the release of a new service offering or head-up an office in a new geography, can be seen as a sign of vitality. Compensation is significantly higher for bankers whose networks are volatile in certain ways. There is no direct effect.  Rather, volatility affects the strength of the compensation association with network advantage. We examine why this is so by distinguishing different sources of volatility.  In addition, we clarify a role for network volatility in current theories of advantage, extending the literatures prevailing focus on the stable and enduring aspects of social structure.",network volatility| status| structural holes

In this paper, we present network analysis as an alternative for developing a suitable methodological approach. Based on a discussion of existing network approaches to organization and communication, we develop a new network approach that encompasses the fundamental assumptions of the CCO perspective. The proposed network approach places communication at the center of the analysis by turning the prevalent network perspective inside out, so that the vertices of the network represent communications and the edges represent individuals.

We argue that categories that are vertically related to the same superordinate category, and hence share with it a set of clearly identifiable features, are more likely to influence each other. By absorbing elements from other related categories, categories that share the same basic level category can evolve their meaning while maintaining their label. Empirically, we look at the influence of Spaghetti Westerns on Western movies produced in the US from the 1960s onwards. In the analysis, we demonstrate how the meaning of the Western category in the US evolved as a result of that influence, and discuss conditions and mechanisms underlying this evolution.

While combining elements of recognized specialties in new ways can produce novel inventions, longer lists of combined specialties make evaluation harder for experts in established fields. To cope, we argue that people seek simplifying structure in such combinations, especially by recognizing and naming recurring patterns--that is, by categorizing them. In the patenting context, the willingness to make new categories is supported by standards that frown on imitation and, with nanotechnology, the emergence of norms favoring interdisciplinary research (IDR). Thus, we expect the cognitive impetus for categorization to combine with a pro-IDR institutional logic to explain growing recognition of nanotechnology. Empirically, we test this argument using nano patents. Results show longer pending time and fewer forward citations for patents that build on a larger number of patent classes, but these effects are moderated by both typicality with the emerging nanotech category and the institutionalization of a pro-IDR logic. These findings contribute to theory and explain how innovation is recognized by linking the value of conformity to cognitive limits and a logic of evaluation that prizes novelty.",innovation| categories| institutions

In this paper, I investigate if and when one particular type of bias, namely, preferential endorsement of ethnic creative innovations, occurs in the population of situation comedies aired on the US networks until 2008. Results show that although ethnic and non-ethnic comedy pilot projects do not confront differential selection by the networks, ethnic sitcoms are 1.7 times more likely to receive endorsements by New York Times critics than non-ethnic sitcoms. Further, preferential treatment of ethnic sitcoms increases as the performance of New York Times improves or the newspaper displays lower editorial propensity to endorse political candidates in elections than its peers.

Funk|U. of Michigan, Ann Arbor||",,"We connect ideas about signaling and certification drawn from network research with institutional concerns about legitimacy and distinctiveness in an effort to explain the market value of high technology firms from five different sectors. This paper demonstrates that different sectors are characterized by distinct combinations of activities and partners and that deviations from those broad network portfolios influence market value. Our theory suggests that firms with network portfolios that deviate from the average of their sector make distinct claims to value, but too much distinctiveness makes attribution of category membership by external evaluators problematic. We therefore expect an inverted U-shaped relationship between market value and the distinctiveness of a firms network portfolio. We use loglinear models to establish significant differences across sectors regarding firms combinations of tie types and partner types. We thereafter find support for our claims about network distinctiveness and market values in a panel analyses. Our findings suggest that important extensions of structural approaches to markets result from the integration of network and institutional theories.",networks| legitimacy| high-technology

Leung|U. of California, Berkeley||2|Brian Philip Reschke|U. of California, Berkeley||",,"This paper examines the consequences to being miscategorized in an ambiguous category. Social objects are often labeled, thereby providing information as to its identity to an external audience. For example, movie titles may communicate what type of movie to expect.  We define an object as being miscategorized when its label contradicts the formalized category to which the object is assigned. This miscategorization vis-a-vis an objects implied category membership should disadvantage it because it will confuse an audience. However, in situations where the category is ambiguous, miscategorized objects purportedly belonging to clearly understood categories may actually be advantagedboth over other objects in that ambiguous category, as well as comparable correctly labeled and categorized objects. This occurs for two reasonsfirst, these objects are more clearly labeled than their peers in the ambiguous category; these clear labels convey more information, resulting in increased appeal compared to the other objects in the ambiguous category. Second, they do not suffer as much competition as their correctly categorized peers who vie for attention among a group of similar others.

Contrary to expectations that greater variation in choices allows a buyer to optimize their transactions, I find evidence in a labor market for freelancing services which suggests otherwise. In particular, the less categorical overlap of past experiences of freelancers bidding on a job, the less likely a buyer will choose any of them and the longer it takes the buyer to do so if they eventually do make a decision. Because categories serve to demarcate like-experiences, greater categorical overlap of the past experiences of freelancers makes them easier to compare, thereby facilitating a decision. However, more experienced buyers of services should be more attuned to what skills are valuable for their task. Therefore, I predict that this effect is moderated by increased experience. These hypotheses are tested with data from www.elance.com. Support is found for the two main effects and partial support is demonstrated for the moderation effect.",categories| markets| commensuration

Previous research has shown that the effect of category spanning on audience appeal depends on the degree of category contrast. This study aims to go a step further by examining interaction between category spanning and the degree of category contrast. The interaction is crucial, authors argue, since category contrast intermediates how multiple category membership affects the audience segment's perception, thereby market outcomes. This study also distinguishes two dimensions of category contrast: potential and actual. Potential category contrast is the extent to which all the other organizations in a category join other categories. On the other hand, actual category contrast refers to the extent to which audiences, buyers or intermediaries, agree with assigning a producer or a product to particular categories. It is argued that such consensus is the category contrast that audience actually perceives in comparing and evaluating different producers. By examining actual category contrast, authors measure how the effect of multiple categories affect market outcomes. It is shown that such effect is contingent upon the extent to which each product presents a relatively focused identity to their audiences. It is also argued that the number of categories and the degree of potential category contrast contribute to actual category contrast, which would measure directly the extent to which category membership of producers affects their audience appeal.",category| niche width| grade of membership (gom)

We find that leagues in young sports whose teams tend to be in cities with large numbers of other sports suffer from higher mortality rates while leagues that are in older more established sports are less likely to fail under these circumstances. The results suggest that new organizational forms reap the greatest benefits by isolating themselves from populations with related identities while older populations can benefit from such interactions. We also find that leagues that employ a mixed strategy (locate in cities that have high variance in the number of sports) also suffer higher mortality rates, particularly under conditions of high competition. Because cities with few sports and many sports represent very different resource spaces that require different strategies, leagues that try to compete in both types of cities simultaneously are less likely to perform well. Finally, we provide evidence that older leagues benefit to a greater extent than younger leagues by being in larger markets (e.g. having access to a larger potential audience).

First, observers frequently suggest that chain retailers are more likely to survive than other kinds of retailers.  Yet, there are more independent retailers than chain retailers in the US.  Following recent work on organizational forms, I posit that there is not one tradeoff between simplicity and complexity of form, but rather multiple tradeoffs.   Retail organizations trade off between chain or independent organizational forms and between multiple-product-category and single-product-category forms.  I hypothesize that the main effect of chain organizational form increases the likelihood of survival; that the effect of being a multiple-category retailer moderates this effect of chains on survival; and finally, that there is a threshold to this positive effect.  My research site is the retail industry in California between 1990 and 2004.  I estimate survival rates for more than 450,000 establishments using event history modeling.

I propose that founding conditions (e.g. density in population and the accumulated failures of others) impact organizational failure by influencing organizational change in relation to market change. By revisiting resource partitioning theory, this paper argues that change compatibility improves survival chance and occurs when an organization expands (contracts) its niche width when the market concentration shifts from high to low (from low to high). Data on the Norwegian general insurance industry shows that change compatibility decreases failure rate. Consistent with the findings in previous studies, density at the time of founding increases failure rate; however, it does so via change compatibility. I find that the accumulated failures until founding reduce failure rate and this also occurs via change compatibility. Finally, the effects of density at the time of founding (failures until founding) on the level of change compatibility are weaker (stronger) for specialists than for generalists. Overall, the present study shows that understanding the role of the interaction of change in niche width and change in market concentration yields a more unified depiction of organizational life course.",niche dynamics| organizational change| organizational failure

We suggest that the degree of coupling among firms within a group affects the performance of groups and firms differently. In a tightly coupled group, affiliated firms can obtain efficient support from one another when they are exposed to an external shock. Such mutual assistance is likely to increase firm survival chances and reduce the variance of firm profitability over time. However, tight coupling also allows performance problems at affiliated firms to diffuse rapidly throughout the whole group, thereby increasing the probability of group failure. We test these predictions on group and firm performance in the South Korean context after the Korean economic crisis in 1997.

In response, coping strategies that provide fertile ground for formation of organizations such as religious congregations and home owner associations are employed.

Consider that an accident at Love Canal has led to one of the most fundamental reforms in environmental protection in the U.S., while other similar events have not led to any comparable change. Organizational institutionalists are ambivalent about why events lead to change. Some theorists argue that shocking events break the status quo but what constitutes shocking is unclear. Others argue that those who seek change look for events merely as a tool to publicize a problem and recruit support. The central goal of this paper is to develop a theory to explain why events lead to significant institutional change by using a comparative case method and grounded theory building. The findings show the direct role of events in institutional change processes; that there is a pattern of claims and activities associated with events that lead to significant institutional change but absent in other events; and that a problem provider plays a key role in the change process. Furthermore, the findings contribute to a clearer idea of what institutional entrepreneurs do, and that is to define deviant practices that are deemed problematic thus compelling significant institutional change.",social construction| institutional entrepreneurship| public policy

To examine how NFC maintained its institution, we examined the discourse surrounding the reform efforts. We found that NFC enacted two strategies; the right to officiate its own reform and controlling the practices that were a part of the reform. In addition, NFC was able to frame the debate over the reform as one of imposition versus negotiation and competitiveness versus decorum.

We investigate how technical innovation enabled a contested cultural institution, the death penalty, to adapt and survive over four centuries in the United States. In particular, we draw on a dataset of the 15,269 executions performed in the U.S. from 1608 to 2002, together with a secondary dataset of articles from The New York Times archives and key political and legal documents from pivotal points in the debate, to demonstrate how the death penalty sustained its legitimacy through three key phases. Each phase is defined by the dominant technology used for the majority of executions at the timedeath by hanging (1608-1887), electrocution (1937-1967), and lethal injection (1977-present).

Calhoun|Georgia Southern U.||2|Joseph Weatherford|Georgia Southern U.||,,"This paper introduces and explains institutional decay, relying on analysis of the U.S. health care institutional field as an example of the condition. Institutions are created to serve a purpose and develop structures in the form of processes and procedures intended to (1) serve the intended purpose of the institution; (2) develop reliability and legitimacy for the institution; and (3) insure the survivability of the institution. Over time, the environmental context in which the institution was born changes, institutional power may shift and expectations and social pressures associated with the function of the institution change. Tension builds and stress placed on the institutional structure provokes a response. While there is a wealth of literature on changes within an institution, there is often a presumption change benefits institutions goals, legitimacy and survivability. However, todays society has many examples of ineffective institutions. Institutional decay is the condition where the institutional structure no longer serves the intended purpose of the institution and no longer promotes institutional legitimacy. Institutional decay exists when the institutional structure is primarily focused on survival of the institutional structure. Analysis of the U.S. health care system aids in explaining the construct. Additional analysis of the genesis of health care decay facilitates consideration of a phoenix rebirth process. The phoenix process involves restoring balance between the institutional structure and the current context and a direct attack on institutional deficiencies, which for health care might involve a incorporation of a business process such as supply chain management.",institutional theory| institutional change| health care

We find that the formation of a new organizational field goes through a process in which field cohesion is first based on existing identities, stressing similarity and need for legitimacy to gain access to resources, then as different from the field that the new organizational field tries to distinguish itself from, drawing boundaries, before uniting around new practices and common issues and focusing on a unique field objective that is not shared by other fields. Transition from one stage to another is enabled by creating relational spaces of interaction. We unpack the notion of relational spaces and show that they must first be inclusive to encourage participation and creativity, and then intimate and safe for actors to develop new practices and unite around common issues.",collective identification| field formation| mechanisms of cohesion

While much is known about the value of schemas, explicit theoretical models of how they develop are lacking. Our study of the insurance industrys development of the computer schema from 1945-1975 addresses this gap.

Moreover, the specific elements of symbolic management have been under-theorized.  This study addresses both of these issues by theorizing and testing the notion that firms that engage in symbolic management across four key questions (why, who, how, and what) can generate positive bankruptcy outcomes.  Specifically, we hypothesize and find that that bankrupt companies can mitigate bankruptcys stigma by i) strategically attributing blame for their failure, ii) publicly acknowledging their alignment with and concern for crucial external stakeholders, iii) proffering specific plans to address their organizations weaknesses, and iv) framing the bankruptcy as a deliberately chosen strategic opportunity.  We argue that these sense-giving strategies can be effective in accentuating managements competence and control over the organizations fate, thus making crucial audiences more inclined to continue supporting the organization post-filing.  We test our hypothesis with data on 250 bankruptcy cases spanning three years, employing a careful content analysis of these companies rich language surrounding the bankruptcy filing.  Our supportive results highlight the importance of active impression management for bankrupt firms, adding to our knowledge of symbolic management and the bankruptcy process.",bankruptcy| sensegiving| impression management

We develop a theoretical model which describes the processes by which theology, as the discursive logic of the institution of religion, constitutes both religious identities and an awareness of the marginalized.

I argue that the concept of dialogue complements the dialectical view on institutional change by describing the interplay of institutions during a process of institutional change. My empirical account describes the pluralistic institutional demands manifest in municipal strategy work in a municipal organization. The article is based on a longitudinal in-depth case study of the municipal strategy process. An ethnographic approach was used, concentrating on the implications of pluralism in daily talk, and their institutional outcomes.Dialogue presented itself as an important arena of negotiation that linked different views on the strategy and the municipal field more generally. The institutional constructs were invoked in dialogue in several different ways, and related to practical problems faced by participants in the strategy process. The participants interleaved and made compromises between institutional requirements that stemmed from very different conceptions of the municipal sector, creating new, local adaptations of these logics. These outcomes influenced choices made later - both during the formal strategy process and after it.The process described in this article differs from most previous accounts of institutional change. The adaptation between different views is continuous, flexible and subtle. Discussants combine aspects of different institutions and mix elements of different institutional logics. The resources and views represented by discrete institutional logics come together and are formed into plastic, local and shared meaning systems that combined elements of different institutional frames.",institutional change| discourse analysis| dialogicality

Through an inductive study of more than 60 university-industry projects spanning the fields of public science and business, we found that the institutional distance between fields created the opportunity for actors to engage in institutional arbitrage and allowed them to reap three types of benefits: resources, legitimacy and ideas. We also found that obstacles to institutional arbitrage increased with increasing institutional distance.

Combining longitudinal interviews with historical archival data, we explore how the shift from central planning to socialist market logic, and eventually to the market logic with a high level of state institutionalization, happens amidst the corresponding shift in the state logic. Our results indicate that the market logic emerges and develops as a result of localized experimentations by the local governments and private enterprises, adaptation by entrepreneurs, recursively interacting with political theorization by the Party elite over time. The mechanisms underlying these three processes are reinforcing because they operate in three interrelated domains  structural, cognitive and normative  of institutional logics. We develop a grounded process model of shifts in societal level institutional logics.

Then using qualitative data from Congressional websites, we developed deeper understanding of the differences in logics we had tested quantitatively.

Moreover, the results suggest that not every dimension of the patriarchal logics is equally potent in their effect. We also find that family and profession patriarchy respectively mediate the impact of religious fundamentalism and state patriarchy on MFO establishment.

In this study we examine an alternative form of impression management that overcomes this crucial limitation - impression management support (IM support) by others on behalf of the beneficiary actor. We examine the determinants and consequences of IM support in communications between CEOs and journalists, where CEOs of other firms provide positive statements about a focal CEO's leadership and strategy and/or external attributions for low performance at the focal CEO's firm. Drawing from social exchange theory, our theoretical perspective suggests how IM support may result from norms of reciprocity among corporate leaders. Three distinct reciprocity mechanisms are explored: i) direct reciprocity in which CEOs who have received IM support from another CEO in the past tend to reciprocate by providing their benefactor with similar such support when given the opportunity; ii) generalized reciprocity in which CEOs who received IM support in the past pay the support forward to another third-party CEO; iii) fairness-based selective giving, wherein CEOs reciprocate IM support to fellow CEOs who they believe have given similar support to other CEOs in the past. Our theoretical perspective also draws from the social psychological literature on persuasion to suggest why IM support for another CEO may have a more positive influence on the tenor of journalist coverage about the firm!-s leadership than impression management by the CEO about his/her own leadership and strategy.

Yet, organizational scholars also point to many examples of problems that are successfully identified and resolved.  Using data from a five-month ethnography in three petrochemical plants, I ask: when and how is the normalization of potential problems more likely to be uncovered or resisted?  To answer this question, I consider a crucial point where normalization often begins.   Specifically, I compare cases where knowledge is abstracted and transferred across organizational boundaries.  As we would expect, abstraction is most effective when authority is granted to the front lines, when physical boundary objects are used to translate knowledge, and when processes provide a mechanism for individuals to raise doubts.  At the same time, even under ideal circumstances, normalization still proceeds in some cases.  I find that normalization proceeds when there is disagreement or uncertainty regarding the correct application of a rule, or when rule bending appears advantageous.  Thus, while managers and policy makers can reduce instances of normalization through good process design, organizations will always remain vulnerable to the normalization of some deviance.",risk| safety| normalization of deviance

We distinguish between alternative mechanisms to develop routines for adopting innovation (trial and error processes and problemistic search versus idea champions) and between early versus later stage routines. We also identify founding conditions and corporate culture as antecedents for AC routines in the context of management innovation.  In line with Lewin et al. (2010)s typology of routines that make up a firms AC capabilities, we studied two cases characterized by similar AC meta routines expressed through very different AC practiced routines. Our research shows that the equifinality of certain routines does not necessarily hold for the mechanisms that guide the emergence and refinement of AC practiced routines. Specifically, the cases suggest that idea championing would be a less time consuming, and therefore more efficient, mechanism to guide the development of adequate AC routines than the problemistic search of such adequate routines.",absorptive capacity routines| management innovation| global sourcing of business services

We argue that falling into success trap is more destructive at early ages than at later ages because greater competence takes longer time to develop.  In order to investigate the antecedents and consequences of early success trap, we develop a model that examines how and when success trap occurs and results in different consequences depending on the time of initial success.  The results from the simulation of our model indicate that (early) success trap is a product of interactions among organizational learning of competences in exploitation and exploration and adaptation of historical and social aspiration levels.  It is shown that success trap occurs when implementing a strategy requires exploitative competence and organizations pay attention to their social positions in adapting aspiration level.  Moreover, success trap becomes detrimental especially at early ages when developing exploratory competence helps searching for a better alternative strategy and organizations learn rapidly from their recent comparative performance within the population.  We suggest that future research find ways to develop exploratory competence that sustain the survival of individual organizations in the short run and the prosperity of the whole population in the longer run.",early success trap| exploration and exploitation| organizational learning

1683,,1|Organizational Scholarship as Emergent Collective Behavior,1|Thomas Will|Agnes Scott College||,,"The collective attributes of organization science have been analyzed extensively. Scholars have described and debated such field-level phenomena as paradigm diversity, the research-practice divide, and theory obsession. However, organizational scholarship is produced by individuals, not a collective. Therefore, in order to understand why the field has the structure and attributes that it has, one must ask how individual scholars make the research decisions that they make. Distinctions between individual activities and collective outcomes are unimportant if one assumes the former to be independent and normally distributed. Existing treatments of knowledge production in organization science implicitly make these Gaussian assumptions. In contexts where the whole differs from the sum of its parts, however, analytic distinctions between levels of analysis are critical to understanding how feedback amplifies and dampens localized events and interactions into collective outcomes. Agent-based modelsalso known as flocking modelsare suited to analyzing such complex contexts because they capture the global behavior of large numbers of interacting autonomous agents. This paper draws on agent-based modeling frameworks to conceptualize organizational scholarship as emergent collective behavior. Representing flock members as organizational scholars and flock movements as patterns in organizational scholarship, I examine how scholar-scholar interconnectivity endogenously drives the fields development. I propose that flock-like collective scholarly behavior emerges from modernist ontological/epistemological assumptions, while swarm-like activity emerges from symbolic-interpretivist and postmodernist assumptions.",emergent collective behavior| philosophy of science| self organization

We compare these on their rationales for social capital as a category, where it is located, the analytical forms they adopt, domains of their inquiry and how it relates to other forms of capital. We observe their allusions to the complex properties of social capital and distil their arguments further to present social capital as a complex process that is transient, emergent, non-homogenous and irreversible, contextually rooted and respectful of historicity. In doing this we make use of how the Austrian school of economics treats capital  as non-homogenous and emergent. It provides us with further conceptual grounding for treating social capital as a complex process, wherein, from an agency perspective, the primacy is on incremental actions which are largely tentative and uncertain of outcomes.

In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework in which organizational identity moderates the impact of experience, so that organizations learn differently from the same experience.    Specifically, we propose that identity serves as the lens through which organizations notice, interpret and systematically respond to experiences, which in turn can influence performance.   We test our theory on a sample of start-up organizations located around a large research university. We hypothesize that identity moderates the impact of the experience of winning Small Business Innovation Research awards on the length of time it takes the start-ups to commercialize their underlying technology or service.  We find that science-oriented identity at founding does moderate  the  impact of winning SBIR awards on commercialization: a strong scientific identity increases the time to commercialization. In contrast, having a business-oriented identity at founding does not moderate the impact of the experience of winning awards.    This research contributes to theories of organizational learning by introducing identity as a moderator of key learning processes. It also advances the literature on organizational identity by underscoring its potential impact on learning activities and outcomes.

Our theorizing focuses on socio-political pressures and how in China, privately controlled firms who are in a lower legitimacy position than state-owned firms are more likely to issue CSR reports. In addition, we hypothesize that factors reflecting the degree of socio-political dependence of the firm such as executive service on political councils, political legacy and financial resources also influence reporting as well as moderate the effect of private control on issuing CSR reports. Secondly, we focus on the symbolic nature of CSR reporting and how variance in the risk of stakeholder monitoring through channels such as bureaucratic embeddedness and extent of local government development influences the extent to which CSR communications are decoupled from substantive CSR activities.  Our database includes all CSR reports issued by Chinese publicly listed firms during the period of 2006-2009, and our hypotheses are generally supported.  We discuss contributions to viewing legitimacy as a strategic resource for corporations, how different types of governmental connections expose companies to different types of legitimacy pressures, and finally how variation in decoupling strategies may be identified by unpacking the different levels of stakeholder monitoring risk.",csr| institutional theory| china

We answer this question through an inductive analysis of how investment banks applied FAS 157, or the Fair Market Rule which required firms to categorize their financial assets and liabilities into a three level fair value hierarchy.  Introduced in 2007, this rule has been closely associated with the recent economic crisis. Surprisingly, investment banks did not converge to a common application of the rule, rather differences in allocation decisions persisted.  Yet they acted in a coordinated way.  We argue that there are qualitatively different market structures and introduce the concept of comparability as a more general way to capture market order.  Through regression analysis, we show that investment banks were more likely to apply FAS 157 in similar ways if they were in the same peer group or were evaluated more closely by key audience members. Collectively, our analysis reveals that the structure of the established market order partially depends upon who the focal actors consider in the process of establishing market order.

We do not find statistically significant differences among manufacturers with respect to the decrease in productivity. After controlling for the endogenous choice of launch plants, we identify several possible ways to mitigate this productivity decrease. Product  flexibility in the body shop is found to mitigate more than a third of the productivity loss. Furthermore, aplant's previous experience with product launches and a plant's experience with the product platform are found to mitigate productivity losses even further. But while the positive impact of platform experience persists over time, the experience with launching other products in the same plant fades quickly.

The findings suggest that organizational politics is clearly a primary source of initial struggle and challenge for new managers. Nevertheless, managers recognize the importance of developing interpersonal relationships with others in their environment (e.g., subordinates, clients, and upper-level management) and become more skilled at using organizational politics and establishing their influence base over time. Contrary to previous literature that largely highlights the negative impacts of organizational politics in organizations, the findings suggest that public managers may still hold themselves to high ethical standards and engage in political behavior primarily on behalf of their organization and in the best interest of the taxpayers rather than in the pursuit of self-interest. Based on these findings, this study argues that the concept of organizational politics should be redefined and expanded to reflect its positive impacts on organizational objectives and organizational life.",organizational politics| managerial role transition| social networks

It plays an important role as societies are facing diverse (social) problems, such as obesity, HIV, violence, or climate change. Restricted public funds, discussions on the social responsibilities of governments and the current financial crisis enhance the interest for effective social marketing campaigns contributing to the reduction of existing social problems. Thus, scientific findings on social marketing effectiveness are particularly relevant. Against this background, this paper aims at developing a midrange theory of social marketing effectiveness out of a systematic analysis of existing research in order to make a theoretical contribution to the field. The developed midrange theory enhances scientific progress in social marketing and is the basis for further academic research as well as for the improvement of practical interventions in terms of social marketing campaigns. Thus, the paper provides managerial implications that are of great relevance for public and nonprofit management as social marketing impacts on the work and mission of public and nonprofit organizations.",midrange theory| social marketing effectiveness| social problems

Taking an inductive method approach, the analysis identifies factors that have not previously been identified as influential on public sector entrepreneurship: geographic location, co-operation, boards power group, and fit between strategy and structure. Public entrepreneurship appears to be differently influenced in the local government corporation compared to the local government administration. In the former, public entrepreneurship is influenced by a set of different factors, such as the board of directors, strategy and structure, employees, and the external environment; but in the latter, public entrepreneurship is influenced mainly by strategy and structure.

Findings from an OLS regression suggest that job flexibility, the quality and reputation of the organization, and those who view work as the most important aspect of their lives are positively related to both public and nonprofit innovation climates. Personnel flexibility (or inflexibility) negatively affects the innovation climate in both the public and nonprofit sectors, and other variables, including advancement motivation, vary by sector.",public management| nonprofit management| organizational innovation

In this paper, we combine the economic theories of nonprofit organizations and theories of incentives to identify the challenges of designing adequate incentive schemes for management control in nonprofit organizations. Employing insights from both economics and behavioral sciences, we broaden the common notion of incentives and draw attention to the analysis of incentive packages and possible interaction effects between different incentive mechanisms in use. Building on contingency-based research on management control systems, we argue that the critical question is not whether incentives are good or bad for nonprofits but, rather, how to design adequate incentive packages that correspond to the nonprofit nature of the organization, serve the specific control needs in nonprofits, and adequately take account of interaction effects between the employed control mechanisms.Paper is No Longer Available Online: Please contact the author(s).In an effort to understand how the proximal work environment shapes job attitudes, this study examined the shared perceptions of 739 professional and technical employees regarding organizational climate and the strength of affective commitment in 51 geographically dispersed offices of an agency of state government.

With these three independent variables, a 4x3x2 factorial design was employed.  Four dependent variables were used to measure the results of the decision-making process: decision success rate, defined as the percentage of forums that reached a decision; the average number of iterations it took the successful forums in each condition to make a decision; the mean level of acceptability (across agents) of the alternative chosen in a successful forum; and the standard deviation of the level of acceptability (across agents) of the alternative chosen in a successful forum to measure the overall equity of that decision. From the results of the computational model, we found more democratic decision making rules are sensitive to forum size. When combined with deliberation process, more democratic decision making rules encouraged participants to reach a decision with higher quality and equity, while slightly improving success rate reaching a decision. We also found unique interactions of unanimity with deliberation process.

We also generate hypotheses related to these two characteristics and outcomes of participation for the adopting firms. Using survey data from Spain  the country reporting the highest volume of business participants in the GC - we find that early and late adopters are motivated similarly by the perceived opportunity of achieving image gains, while late adopters are motivated more by economic gains than early adopters.  Hence we did not find evidence for the two-stage model of institutional theory. The results also show that companies with more intangible resources are motivated more by image gains than those with fewer resources. Our findings offer evidence that both theories have merit in explaining adoption behavior. Our findings also suggest that firms with more intangible resources and those participating in the Spanish Local Network implement the GC principles, gain access to external networks, and improve their CSR understanding more than those firms with fewer intangible resources. Thus we find that GC adoption provides more positive outcomes for active network members and for those possessing better resources.",un global compact| corporate social responsibility| csr initiatives

Therefore the purpose of this study is to better understand the factors that encourage firms to adopt CSR strategies. More specifically, we develop and test a theoretical argument that industry characteristics play an important role in a firms decision to adopt CSR strategies. Using multilevel modeling and longitudinal panel data from 2003 to 2009, we find that industry membership is a significant determinant of engagement in CSR. As hypothesized, we find that firms are more likely to engage in CSR when their industrys economic environment is high in dynamism and when their product environment is high in differentiation, and firms were less likely to engage in CSR when their product environment was high in capital intensity. Contrary to our expectations, we find a negative association between industry profitability, competitive rivalry and questionable industry involvement, and adoption of CSR strategies.

In doing so, we develop two primary contributions: First, we expand the stakeholder group concept into a stakeholder tetrad that includes how managers perceive the issues and requested actions that stakeholder groups bring to the firm via a request tactic  which we term the accordion effect. Second, we build on Mitchell and colleagues (1997) suggestion that power, legitimacy and urgency attributes define the salience of stakeholders for managers by reallocating these attributes along the newly formed stakeholder tetrad, and by exploring in greater depth the relationships that exist between these attributes, which lead them to compound and/or interact in certain applications  which is captured in the snowball effect.

This paper examines how a firm may be able to use the processes of entrepreneurial orientation; autonomy, innovativeness, risk taking, proactiveness and competitive aggressiveness; to behave more entrepreneurially towards their social responsibilities.

Such economies are underpinned by functioning institutions, where compliance with regulation is assumed. Recently however, the capacity of this traditional CSR approach, to take account of the different economic and institutional arrangements found non-western contexts, has been challenged. It has been argued that CSR research needs to be more contextualised, and that the western interpretation and assumptions about what CSR is and how it is enacted needs to be broadened and challenged to take account of different stages of economic development. With this in mind, this paper presents a contextualised critique of CSR undertaken in the Russian Federation. Based on a qualitative study involving managers within privatised Russian firms, this paper explores the type, nature, and scope of CSR undertaken and the attendant motivation of firms to engage in CSR practice. In so doing, this paper adopts not only a beyond compliance definition, but also seeks to contextualise the CSR experience within Russian firms by taking account of the historical and cultural antecedents of both the Soviet Union and the transition period itself. In so doing we reveal that while the market is driving conventional forms of CSR within some Russian firms, the historical legacy of the both the Soviet and transition period also influences the type and nature of CSR undertaken.

This paper focuses on the ability of firms to learn political knowledge, and on how such knowledge shapes political strategy. We develop a conceptual framework that distinguishes between four types of political knowledge: generic, institution-specific, firm-specific and firm-institution-specific political knowledge. We propose several hypotheses that relate the role of vicarious and experiential learning to the development of the different types of political knowledge. We find support for our hypotheses in a statistical analysis of the initiation of regulatory proceedings by firms in the U.S. electric utility sector.",political strategy| lobbying| learning

However, the model of deliberative democracy as generally referred to in business ethics is only appropriate for conceptualizing interaction between business and society that occurs within a context that is more or less institutionalized. It cannot account for unregulated interaction between business and civil society. We argue that we need to resort to the so called critical strand of deliberative democracy if we want to conceptualize interaction that happens without the involvement of decision-making institutions as political action in a deliberative sense. By adopting this approach we argue that deliberative principles are meaningful for judging unregulated interaction between business and civil society and that there are cases in which unregulated interaction is preferable over institutionalization.",csr| ngo-business interaction| political role of corporations

Accordingly, in this paper, we analyze the constructs associated with unethical supervision from a normative perspective and find a heavy emphasis on violations of dignity, autonomy, and justice.  We then propose a definition of unethical supervision grounded in the implicit normative theories of past research.

We build on the corporate governance, rational choice, business ethics and reputation literatures to develop a model of reputational penalties that includes both contextual and firm-level variables.  Reputational penalty is the loss in market value after accounting for the direct costs of the prosecution, such as fines and fees.  Overall both the annual number of prosecutions under the FCPA and amount of fines have increased during this time period with 17 companies being fined $1.3 billion in 2010.  On average the population of 134 public firms that were investigated under the FCPA from 1978 to 2009 lost an average of $286.3 million for a total market loss of $39.5 billion.   We then tested five proposed moderating effects on the relationship between bribery and reputational penalty to examine probable sources of reputation loss and opportunities to mitigate it. We find significant reputational penalties for corporate corruption investigations.  However, surprisingly the amount of the bribe was negatively related to the reputational penalty.  In addition we find that firms, who bribe in less corrupt countries, who are investigated by more regulators, and who voluntarily disclose their investigation, suffer greater reputational penalties for a given level of bribery than their peers.  We find that board or management involvement decreases the penalty.

Yet, little is known about if or how privacy expectations change across technologies  when a conversation, or information exchange, is moved from a private room to email or even to Facebook.  In fact, a common misconception suggests privacy expectations are diminished or absent in locations where information is physically more vulnerable  more easily accessed or less easily controlled, thus leaving proverbial privacy vacuums without norms to govern information exchange with certain technologies.  This study examines if and how privacy expectations change based on the technological platform.  The research design isolates the effects of locating the information exchange across physical rooms, email, and Facebook.  I found a technology gap where privacy expectations significantly differed when the exchange was located on Facebook and in a private or public room.  Furthermore, this gap is best explained when modeled by a shift in privacy expectations rather than fully technology-specific privacy norms; therefore, the expectations on email and Facebook were connected to the privacy expectations offline with a different base expectation.  Surprisingly, out of the five locations tested, respondents consistently afforded information on email the highest privacy protection  even greater than when locating the same exchange in a private room.  In addition, while undergraduate students differed from non-undergraduates when assessing Facebook as a location, no difference was found when assessing email.

(WITHDRAWN),1|Elisa Giuliani|U. of Pisa||,,"It is only very recently that management scholars directed their attention to business models of firms in emerging economies, notably in Asia. This has been justified by the fact that these countries are taking the lead in international competition and thus require more careful consideration and analysis. However, the study of corporate behaviour and accumulation of technological capabilities in emerging economies has been a subject of research by development and innovation scholars, who, since the end of the 1970s have produced a wealth of empirical evidence about how firms in Asia as well as Latin America become able to upgrade and compete in international markets. Within this stream of literature, most of the focus has been directed at understanding how domestic firms in emerging and developing countries could learn from multinational firms from the west, essentially how and whether the local context can improve its technologies and skills through the combination of local learning processes and global connections. More recently, scholars have extended their perspective, and have become interested in understanding how multinational firms from the west could contribute to the social development of the emerging economies in which they operate, promoting or hampering local human rights conditions. Attention to social development processes is in fact becoming one of the key debated issues, as technological advancements reached without justice and improvement of people living conditions is considered not to be the right way to progress. As suggested by J. Stiglitz in his Nobel Prize lecture (2001), academics have the responsibility to ensure that the world of the future be one in which there is not only greater economic prosperity, but also more social justice.This paper addresses this issue. It explores the conditions under which multinational firms can both create the opportunities for technological learning in host emerging and developing countries, while also respecting the local communities human rights. It also shows that there are several sets of circumstances in which technological learning from advanced countries multinationals is unlikely to occur, while the presence of global business operations may impact negatively on local communities human rights.

Therefore, we argue the need for a new, more transparent type of hedge fund that would operate side-by-side with todays more opaque variety.  While offering 10 categories of additional information to investors, as detailed here, these new funds would continue to operate in the hedge fund industrys current, lightly regulated environment.  We suggest a voluntary, principle-based method of implementation that would allow investors to self-select into investing in these slightly less risky hedge funds that would yield slightly lower returns.  The availability of this more transparent hedge fund option is intended to help ameliorate the recent degradation of trust both in the hedge fund industry and in our financial system as a whole.",corporate governance| investors| hedge funds

Wheeler|U. of Rhode Island||,,"In this paper, we investigate a particular type of account, underestimation of loss, which has become a prevalent strategy among organizations when responding to a crisis. Underestimation can mitigate negative feelings among stakeholders, diffuse responsibility, and reduce the risk of litigation, but it can also have unintended consequences if the initial accounts of loss prove unreliable. In these instances, an underestimation account will magnify current levels of stakeholder disapproval because it fails to correctly reframe stakeholder expectations, instead letting them fester through constant re-evaluation. As an alternative approach, we develop theory suggesting a more realistic estimation of loss may enhance an organizations responses and stakeholders reactions to a crisis. Realistic estimation limits stakeholder discourse, allowing stakeholder perceptions to coalesce around a new frame. In turn, this leads to greater stakeholder approval and less damage to the offending organizations legitimacy. Our theory fills an important void in the organizational and communications literatures on managing stakeholder expectations in the aftermath of a crisis.",crisis management| expectancy violations| legitimacy

Madsen|Brigham Young U.||2|Zachariah Rodgers|Brigham Young U.||,,"The primary theoretical lens applied by contemporary work to the link between corporate social performance (CSP) and corporate financial performance (CFP) is stakeholder theory, which suggests that certain stakeholders value certain types of CSP (such as philanthropic contributions to particular causes) and that these stakeholders may reward firms that engage in these forms of CSP or punish those that do not. However, several key external stakeholder groups typically learn of firm social activities only through intermediariesprimarily the mass media. Consequently, if CSP constitutes a calculated purchase of advertising services, as Knauer (1994: 425) asserts, the value of the advertising purchased is largely contingent on the amount of media attention a firms CSP activities attract. In this paper, we explore the antecedents of mass media coverage of CSP by integrating stakeholder theory with media agenda building theory, a prominent theoretical view on mass media attention from the mass communication literature. We then test the resulting hypotheses on a sample of public companies that directed philanthropic efforts to the relief effort following the Haitian earthquake in January 2010, finding that mass media coverage of firm contributions to the relief effort were driven by several aspects of firms, of CSP activities, and of the approaches firms use to communicate their CSP activities.

Even more, most research has focused on American firms and has used cross sectional data. Unfortunately, very few studies have empirically examined this link with firms across several countries and with longitudinal data, which greatly enhance causal inference. In this paper we try to fill this gap by initially justifying CSP as a strategic decision and hence as endogenous. Then, we empirically test the impact of CSP on CFP with a panel of 224 firms across several European and American countries, over a period of 6 years. We employ SAMs ratings for the measurement of CSP and the GMM system estimator to properly account for endogeneity. Our results show that the link between CSP and CFP is neutral. Hence, we argue that CSP is not a causal factor of CFP but should rather be viewed as an indicator of overall quality management.",corporate social performance| corporate financial performance| endogeneity

Beyond functioning as guides for decision making, the corporate social responsibility values of middle managers directly influence the attitudes and opinions subordinates feel toward the manager. Although studies of corporate social responsibility emphasize the examination of values held by managers, the mechanism by which managers communicate their values to subordinates is still unclear. Based on value-based leadership theory, this study adopted the dual-focus transformational leadership model and proposed that group-focused transformational leadership may be the mediating process that connects the corporate social responsibility values of middle managers to the perception of those values by the subordinates. Using dyadic questionnaires, the final usable sample in this study comprised 252 employees and 43 leaders from 28 small-sized private firms in the pharmaceutical industry.

Specifically, at high levels of board crosscutting diversity, we find a J-shaped relationship such that firms experience low, declining performance from zero to low levels of managerial diversity but rapidly increasing positive performance from moderate to high levels of managerial diversity. While firms with homogeneous management and a homogenous board observe average performance, firms exhibit the lowest performance when they have incongruity between level of management diversity and board diversity. In addition, our study shows that these interaction effects are stronger for firms that utilize formalized mentoring practices as a managing diversity mechanism such that the highest performance institutions were configured with high managerial diversity, high board diversity, and formal diversity mentoring for minority managers.

While Islamic scholars generally agree that women and men are equal because both are created by one God, there are two competing interpretations with respect to the principle of gender diversity. The first is an egalitarian interpretation which advocates affirmative action in women's favor, and the second is a patriarchal interpretation which supports women's subordination to men. This paper presents this normative discussion and uses it to review the legal framework of equal opportunity at work in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Our aim is to theorize equal opportunity in Islamic ideology and culture. The review suggests that equal opportunity laws in Pakistan are characterized by the same ambivalence which is found in the normative interpretations of gender diversity. While there are laws which support women's equality to men and also support affirmative action to protect and advance women's rights, there are also laws which tend to have adverse implications for women's participation in employment and other areas of public life.

Edelman et. al., (2001) conceptualise this shift as the 'managerialization of law' whereby the rise of diversity rhetoric occurs in tandem with a decline in the popularity of the legally driven principles of AA and EEO, creating a 'see-saw effect' (Bacchi 2000). Although this was demonstrated to have occurred in the professional management literature, Edelman, et al., (2001) acknowledge they did not investigate the extent to which this 'managerialization' occurs in organizations.  This paper presents three case studies of how organizations across Australia's economic sectors potentially managerialize the country's EEO legislation.

Study 1 demonstrated this effect with a sample of men who participated in an online experiment. Study 2 extended the finding to interacting groups, showing that men evaluated a woman in their group as contributing less leadership and having fewer skills when there were two women in the group than when there were one or three. We also found that men viewed groups with two women as less cohesive than those with one or three women. The results shed light on duo status, being one of exactly two members of a social category in a group, and on critical mass, the smallest number of category members in a small group required to reduce stereotyping from the majority. We discuss the implications of these effects for managing diversity in groups and organizations.",subgroups| gender| stereotyping

Although many studies investigated a broad range of issues such as occupational gender typing, tokenism and pay inequity, they document the experiences of women who have spent a few years in their careers, and ignore the individuals early career experiences in organizations. Organizational socialization forms a significant part of the individuals early work experiences, and socialization can set the tone for the individuals progress through the organization and in her career. Gender biases in organizational socialization practices known as socialization tactics could potentially influence newcomer adjustment, affect her performance, commitment and career expectations. This paper addresses two questions pertaining to organizational socialization and gender. First, the study investigated if female newcomers to organizations receive the same amount of socializing influences as their male counterparts. Secondly, the study investigated the moderating effect of gender and occupational field on socialization practices and socialization outcomes. The study was conducted using a sample of business graduates of a Southeast Asian university. Results show that female newcomers receive less social support in the form of serial tactics and investiture than their male counterparts. Results also show the gender moderates the effects of socialization tactics on role outcomes. Female newcomers tend to benefit more through the mentoring and interaction provided through serial tactics and investiture while male newcomers seem to benefit from the structured learning of fixed and sequential tactics.",gender and organizations| organizational socialization| women in organizations

Study 1 suggests that motivated diversity construals emerge when participants are exposed to an organization characterized by racial inequality. Specifically, anti-egalitarians broaden their diversity construal to include non-racial heterogeneity, whereas egalitarians narrow their construal to exclude non-racial heterogeneity. Study 2 suggests that when an organization achieves racial equality, participants revert to non-motivated diversity construals, presumably because motivated construals cannot be used to affect inequality in an egalitarian context.

This paper offers a third perspective, one that suggests a harmonic reconciliation between the two perspectives.

We theorize that the gain and loss of resources are orthogonal constructs, which separately mediate the paths of work-family enrichment and conflict.

Helping professionals, such as social workers who are trained to give care to others, may be vulnerable to overdevelop an identity around the role of a caregiver.  Preliminary research in social work suggests a relationship between an overbearing caregiver identity and distress.  We used a sample of 215 social workers to further test a hypothesized curvilinear relationship between caregiver role over-identification and distress based on control theory and the theory of conservation of resources.  Furthermore, we tested self-esteem and social support as potential moderators in this curvilinear relationship.  Results show a curvilinear relationship that distress increases exponentially as caregiver identity increases.  Additionally, social support (as an external resource), rather than self-esteem (as an internal resource), is important in moderating the impact of social workers caregiver role over-identification on distress.  This is the first study to empirically examine the effects of role-based professional identity dysfunction of helping professionals, and the moderating role of self-esteem and social support.

Through analysis of these 57 cases, we identified four ways in which Baby Boomers report being affected by organizational change in late career. The change can lead directly to termination of their job, to a change in the nature of their work, to perceptions of a breach in values, or as a capstone for the end of the career. While multiple theoretical perspectives can help us understand these responses, we analyze these findings through the perspectives of narratives and psychological contracts.

In turn, organizations are saving millions of dollars in real estate costs, while employees are saving time and money associated with commuting to work. Employees also praise remote work assignments for their flexibility and autonomy. Further, because of this flexibility and autonomy, it is often believed that the work-family balance of remote workers is facilitated. However, the little research on the work-family conflict of these workers has shown inconsistent results. While some suggest that remote workers report low levels of work-to-family conflict, others have suggested that the integration of work and family associated with remote work can breed conflict.

Using longitudinal data (2000-2008) from 656 publicly listed firms in Taiwan, we find that firms opted for a (1) rapid pace, (2) a narrow scope, and (3) an irregular rhythm of internationalization when they were high level of the family ownership. We also observe that R&D investment intensity (indicated that gives owners managerial discretion and power to make decisions) positively moderates the relationship between family ownership and processes of firm internationalization (internationalization pace, internationalization scope, and internationalization rhythm). These findings highlight that the ownership structure and managerial discretion have the significant influences on a firm!|s internationalization processes. This research contributes to the literature linking corporate governance and corporate strategy in terms of firm internationalization.

We focus on the cultural concept of power distance to test these competing perspectives. First, we deconstructed the concept and measures of power distance and develop scales that reliably and validly differentiate between the societal level values and workplace practices.  Next, drawing on these measures, we test the congruence-vs.-superior practices hypotheses in seven countries spanning the emerging economies of the East and developed countries of the West, and find support for the superior-practices perspective. Employees and teams across these culturally diverse seven countries responded favorably to less autocratic supervision and greater autonomy, resulting in better employee attitudes, team trust, collaboration, and innovation.  Lastly, trust in global teams was found to mediate the relationships between power distance and these outcomes. Findings from this study not only contribute to our understanding of the cultural value of power distance, but also provide insight into the central question of when and how management practices should be adapted to local cultures. Results of this study have implications for transcending the East versus West divide to facilitate greater integrative thinking and practice across contexts in regard to power distance.",power distance| cultural values| trust

By analyzing a panel dataset of 1,098 publicly-traded manufacturing firms in the United States from 1993 to 2006 using fixed-effect panel modeling we find that risk-taking increases as the values of exercisable stock options fall below or rise above the reference point, although the reference point does not play a significant role for unexercisable options.

It is argued that in addition to the traditional factors surrounding management consultant use (e.g., expert advice, time compression diseconomies, and social capital), top managers hire management consultants to mitigate risks involved with implementing the difficult change.   Management consultants provide expert sensemaking to the organization that can be crafted to support the agenda of top management.  Additionally, management consultants are expendable to the client organization, and this allows them to be used to effectuate experimental and risky organizational, technological, or strategic change.  Finally, given that management consultants are expendable, they provide excellent scapegoats to top management if the desired outcomes are not achieved.  Moreover, management consultant teams (MCTs) and management consultant firms (MCFs) are minimally affected by a client firms scapegoating.

The results show, furthermore, the importance of training employees in the required new behavior if one is seriously intending to upgrade ones service quality and/or change the culture. Longitudinal social-capital studies are recommended that focus on better headquarter collaboration with those who have detailed local service knowledge or insights into what service employees see as barriers and opportunities for service enhancements.

Since high turnover rates are related both to costs and diminished organizational performance due to an outflow of knowledge, an effective retention strategy for professional services employees is needed. This research focuses on integrating the external factor, i.e. the client, as a determinant of employee retention. Concretely, we assess client satisfaction as a determinant for professional services employee retention, mediated by employee satisfaction. In order to rule out the reversed effect of employee satisfaction on client satisfaction, a robust research design focusing the causality of this effect is applied. Therefore, we surveyed professional services client employee dyads with a time lag and evaluate the data with structural equation modeling. With this dyadic field data, we investigate the effect of client satisfaction on employee satisfaction in detail by integrating the mediating variable perceived appreciation.Our data supports both a strong direct and a mediated effect of client satisfaction on employee satisfaction and retention.

In order to reveal how actors address these sensemaking gaps, the study examines the reform process of the Lutheran Church in Germany. Our empirical analysis reveals how the members of the Lutheran Church introduce, extend and focus the beacon metaphor to frame their efforts of assigning meaning to the change. Our findings show that during the phases of the sensemaking process, the beacon metaphor enabled the actors to bridge the sensemaking gaps and helped to reconcile the incompatible interpretive processes into a shared meaning. As the sensemaking process finally came to a shared understanding, the metaphor became obsolete. We contribute to the literature by extending current work on sensemaking in strategic change, by providing a better understanding of the role of metaphors in sensemaking processes, and by adding on to recent studies on stability and change.

The present research contributes to the literature in the following ways: 1) by providing a longitudinal analysis of the relation between the pattern of change in work values and the pattern of change in globalization; 2) by using a measure of globalization to examine the globalization phenomenon in this analysis, and 3) by bridging the domain of economics and psychology by bringing together two concepts from this different fields.",globalization| work values| change

Psychic Distance Revisited,1|Sanjay Bhowmick|Auckland U. of Technology||,,"Psychic Distance as a concept, earlier conflated with cultural distance between countries, is now understood as an individual level construct. It is argued that direct subjective data from entrepreneurs rather than analyses of external factors would be useful in assessing psychic distance as an individual perception construct of psychic distance in entrepreneurial internationalisation. In-depth empirical data from entrepreneurs in 2006 and 2010 present a longitudinal perspective, across the global downturn period, of their decisions or intention to enter specific foreign markets. The paper finds that psychic distance is alive but is a more complex and nuanced phenomenon in entrepreneurial internationalisation than what has hitherto been framed by a normative inverse relationship of psychic distance and internationalisation action of large firms. Entrepreneurial psychic distance as an individual level construct is found to be better understood in conjunction with offshore opportunity perception of entrepreneurs. The idea of opportunity distance is proposed, with entrepreneurs individual perceptions of psychic distance-opportunity combination defining a threshold for international action / intention decisions. Further, despite action / intention decision to enter a foreign market the entrepreneurs report a consistent decline in the opportunity distance perception for all markets during the widespread economic downturn. This decline, despite the growing eastern markets of India and China, confirms that entrepreneurs still having psychic distance fears that are at least partly based on cultural differences with foreign country markets. Limitations and further research possibilities of psychic distance in entrepreneurial internationalisation are discussed.",psychic distance| internationalisation| entrepreneurial opportunity

Internalized goals or Injunctive Norms,1|Krishna Savani|Columbia Business School||,,"We examine the claim that acting deferentially in the presence of authority figures is more pervasive in Indian than in Western cultures, and explore two psychological mechanisms for this cultural difference: internalized goals and injunctive norms. Study 1 found that after reflecting upon an authoritys expectations, Indians but not Americans accommodate in their clothing choices but not in their evaluations of various clothing options. Study 2 found that merely activating the concept of authority figures, without highlighting specific expectations, was sufficient to influence Indians choices of various courses but not their evaluations. Examining a more basic distinction underlying internalized goals vs. injunctive norms, Study 3 found that authority primes influenced Indians ratings of what they should do but not what they want to do. Study 4 found that the effect of explicit authority primes did not increase after brief delays, thus inconsistent with the internalized goal mechanism. However, participants who were less likely to accommodate to the salient authority experienced more guilt across delay conditions, thus supporting the injunctive norms mechanism. The findings suggest that managers might be more successful in manipulating deferential behaviors in Indian settings by changing the injunctive norms prevalent in the organization rather than by changing employees personal values.",accommodation| norms| culture

How this relationship manifests itself in the case of the Multinational Corporation (MNC) remains under-researched. The popular view of the Integration-Responsiveness (IR) paradigm suggests TMT members in the MNC need to understand and respond to global efficiency pressures and local area differences when formulating strategy. By combining UE and IR theory we investigate how IR moderates relationships between TMT composition and performance in the MNC. Using a sample of 115 US MNCs, we uncover three ways in which IR moderates this relationship: (1) larger TMT sizes boost return on sales in responsive - but not integrated - industries; (2) higher average TMT ages boost sales growth in integrated  but not responsive - industries; and (3) responsive industries are more sensitive to diversity in TMT tenure than integrated ones. Our contribution is to demonstrate the usefulness of Upper Echelons theory within the IR paradigm, and suggest that the IR framework needs to be extended beyond a focus on structural and differentiated fit to incorporate cognitive elements of those who set strategy.",top management teams| integration - responsiveness| mnc performance

In addition, we suggest that firm orientation towards organizational design as part of an offshoring strategy and offshoring experience moderate the relationship between complexity and hidden costs negatively i.e. reduces the cost generating impact of complexity. We develop three hypotheses and test them on comprehensive data from the Offshoring Research Network (ORN). In general, we find support for our hypotheses.

Cross-border mergers and acquisitions provides a useful context for studying the role of superior information in acquirer value capture because of the profound information costs affecting international trade and investment.  Firms can capture value from acquisitions either by leveraging their unique resources and capabilities or by exploiting superior information. Nearly all prior work on mergers and acquisitions has focused on the unique resource means of acquirer value capture.   A multinationals network of subsidiaries is one source of insight relevant to evaluating  target firms.  As actors gain experience in a target country, some of this market knowledge spillsover locally to the multinationals subsidiaries.  Acquirers with a subsidiary network across countries that have extensive ties with the targets country will therefore have access to the superior information they need to capture value from their acquisitions.

Levin|Rutgers U.||2|Helena Barnard|U. of Pretoria||,,"We examine an under-researched mechanism for cross-border knowledge flows: interpersonal contact, such as via phone or email. Specifically, we explore the idea that expatriates, especially those who have moved from developing to developed countries, can serve as a broad-based knowledge resource for managers back home, providing new and useful insights. However, while a manager back home may have connections to compatriots living and working abroad, accessing this ""distant knowledge"" from another context comes at a cost. In particular, expatriates who are asked to share their knowledge may (1) find it difficult, (2) be unmotivated, or (3) know little that is new. To test these ideas, and to better understand the possibilities and limitations of managers obtaining knowledge from expatriates, we prompted South African middle managers (who were part-time graduate-level business students) to seek advice on an important work project from two fellow South Africans outside their usual advice network: one locally and one in a developed country. As predicted: (1) having longer conversations with expatriates was not as valuable as it was with locals, indicating the logistical complexity of communicating long distance; (2) stronger ties to expatriates yielded more useful knowledge, indicating that expatriates may be motivated to help some managers back home more than others; and (3) expatriates were mainly useful only when the manager needed new-to-the-industry knowledge, indicating that seeking knowledge locally can sometimes be as good or better than looking abroad.

Extant literature on isolating mechanisms, however, focuses largely on intrinsic characteristics of knowledge that engender causal ambiguity and uniqueness, ignoring geographic scope as a source of causal ambiguity and uniqueness. This paper posits that geographic scope can be an independent source of isolating mechanisms because embeddedness of knowledge in the multiple layers of nested networks within a country can increase causal ambiguity and uniqueness to those who do not have membership in the networks, independently from intrinsic characteristics of knowledge. Therefore, causal ambiguity and uniqueness can originate not only from intrinsic characteristics of knowledge but also from the geographic scope. On this basis, this paper maintains that, independently from and jointly with intrinsic characteristics of knowledge, geographic scope can increase overall causal ambiguity and uniqueness of knowledge to be imitated, thus creating isolating mechanisms. Empirical analyses with patents in the semiconductor industry filed to the European Patent Office (EPO) during the period of 1978 ~ 2009 corroborate the arguments. This paper contributes to the literature of international business and strategic management in two ways.

The overseas subsidiaries in China, on the other hand, tend to rely upon international internal and external knowledge inputs in generating new technological knowledge, which has been mainly used to build subsidiary-level competency.

Specifically, we took advantage of an unusual experiment put in place by a multinational firm, Irdeto, to shift from a single-location HQ in Amsterdam to a dual-core HQ in Amsterdam and Beijing. Using a quasi-experimental research design, we examined the specific consequences of this shift and we found that it led to an enhanced presence in product markets, and improved access to factor markets, in Asia, without any negative impact on its position in Europe.

It was proposed that corrupt values and beliefs (i.e., greed, savvy, bravery, and wariness) and perceived crime risk would moderate the relationship between social stigma consciousness and deviant and withdrawal behavior. We found that some corrupt values and perceptions of crime risk interacted with social stigma associated with the occupation such that corrupt values would influence the deviant and withdrawal behavior of police officers. First, people who perceived higher stigma left their jobs. However, this relationship depended upon the degree to which officers held values of greed and savvy.

Such learning in fact allows young firms to change their path dependency while older firms in the same economy find such change more difficult.

1985,,"2|Reforms, Multinationalization, and Profitability",1|Luis Alfonso Dau|Northeastern U.||,,"Building on Knowledge-Based Theory, I study the relationship between pro-market reforms, firm internationalization strategy, and firm profitability in developing countries. I argue that pro-market reforms augment firm profitability because they increase the competitiveness of local markets, allowing firms to increase their market experiential knowledge and ultimately their profitability. However, I also explain that the effects of reforms on firm profitability may be enhanced by the international strategic choices of firms because such choices may increase the potential for absorptive capacity and learning. I propose that developing-country firms that operate in international markets increase their market experiential knowledge by learning how to compete at international levels, which makes it easier to be competitive in their home market in response to reforms. This effect is especially pronounced for developing-country firms that establish subsidiaries in advanced economies, as it forces them to develop their market knowledge to the highest international levels. It is also stronger for firms that become multinationals before the start of pro-market reforms implementation because such firms have a head-start over other local firms by learning how to compete at international levels before the local market becomes more competitive. In short, I argue that the different aspects of a firms internationalization that help increase its market experiential knowledge enhance the benefits of pro-market reforms on firm profitability because they make it easier for the firm to compete successfully in a market where such reforms are implemented. Using a panel of the largest 500 companies in Latin America from 1989-2008 and data from multiple sources, the analyses provide robust support for these arguments.",pro-market reforms| firm internationalization strategy| firm profitability

The distinctive feature of INVs is to internationalize from inception. This conceptual innovation was rapidly followed by a substantial number of empirical studies of the phenomenon. Yet, empirically, the exact timing of INVs' internationalization is still open to debate. In order to address this gap and in order to (in)validate the specificity attributed to INVs, this article systematically reviews INV empirical research from 1994 to 2010. This paper contributes to the international business literature by helping resolve the definitional ambiguity pointed out by Oviatt and McDougall themselves. The originality of this research lies in that we assess the specificity of INV along three criteria: the measurement of inception (how old are INVs at the time of their first international step), the relevancy of inception as a particular characteristic of INV, and the distinctiveness of INV internationalization model. Our review of empirics leads us to call for more research on the locus of internationalization, precisely at the organizational and individual levels, as well as on the actual applicability of the Uppsala stage model, yet rejected by the INV protagonists.",timing of internationalization| uppsala model| international new ventures

Varying the structure of these wholly owned subsidiaries is one such strategy.  However a review of past research exploring this issue yields a paradox; previous results find higher levels of political hazards to be related to the use of both wholly owned Greenfield ventures and acquisitions. In an effort to resolve this paradox we theorize and empirically examine the notion that capabilities developed by the firm from past product diversification and international business experiences mitigate the transaction costs related to political hazards and consequently influence the establishment mode decision.  Using data from a large sample of Nordic firms we find empirical support for this theory.  Our analysis indicates that firms prefer Greenfield ventures when they enter politically hazardous markets and possess product diversity-based capabilities and/or international business-based capabilities but prefer acquisition modes when they lack such capabilities. These results provide support for the use of establishment mode choice as a strategy for dealing with political hazards.,establishment mode| entry modes| political hazards

Based on organizational ecology theory (OET), our study considers the tension between legitimation and competition pressures. This is a significant step beyond institutional theory, which only accounts for the former pressure. 	Based on a sample of Japanese MNCs, we find that there is an interaction effect between subsidiary size and FDI legitimacy on both subsidiary ownership and expatriate staffing levels. With increasing FDI legitimacy, smaller subsidiaries tend to increase their ownership and expatriate staffing levels, whereas larger subsidiaries tend to reduce their ownership and expatriate staffing levels. The results hold both across host countries and over time. 	Our findings have significant theoretical and practical implications. MNCs are advised to give full attention to the dual pressure of legitimation and competition when determining subsidiary control strategies. Caution is advised when applying the institutional theory based prescription that MNCs should assume higher ownership and expatriate staffing levels in their subsidiaries with increasing FDI legitimacy.",fdi legitimacy| subsidiary control| organizational ecology theory

In contrast to the literature, our analysis, using the longitudinal data of CAC40 firms in France from 1998 to 2005, reveals that both newly adopted shareholder-oriented and socially characteristic governance mechanisms are partly meaningful for performance improvement. However, more importantly, noteworthy is that the performance of firm activities, measured by market capitalization, Tobins Q, and R&D intensity, is substantially facilitated through the interaction of contrasting governance mechanisms such as independent directors and state ownership. We thus argue that the coexistence of contrasting governance mechanisms reflects a firms strategically compromised response to the competing rationales of global and domestic pressures for performance improvement, formulating a path-generating trajectory of organizational change beyond the dichotomy.",corporate governance| france| state ownership

The French case is particularly well placed to study the diffusion of shareholder value in new contexts given the high degree of legal protection for workers in France. We investigate the extent and conditions under which French firms implement asset divestures and/or employee layoffs. We present three important findings. First, the impact associated with the arrival of institutional investors in France is mediated by the institutional framework of employment protection and ownership structure of firms. Hedge funds and stock option incentives had a positive impact on asset divestiture, whereas the effect of hedge funds on employee layoffs was positive and significant only in the case of ownership diffused companies. CEO stock option incentives do not work as an incentive mechanism in the case of employee layoffs. Second, layoffs in French companies are !degdefensive!+- - i.e. driven by the strong operating performance of firms rather than constituting a mechanism for earnings management designed to please financial markets. Third, the impact of foreign funds varies according to the types of institutional investors. While the investment allocation of all types of foreign investors was not significantly associated to restructuring activities, we found hedge funds were significant and positive.

However, the patents filed by emerging country subsidiaries are less likely than home-country patents to be cited by firms external to the MNC network.  We also find that over time, emerging economy subsidiaries simultaneously become more globally integrated and more self-reliant, and begin to develop knowledge that is divergent from the rest of the MNC network.

Connecting and broadening these research streams, the present study develops a theoretical model of the influence on IO of top managements transformational and transactional leadership and examines to what degree these effects are subject to the national cultural context. Data from 790 firms from six western and Asian countries validate the theoretical model empirically. Findings show that transformational and transactional leadership have a positive impact on IO, but are culturally dependent: transformational leadership has a stronger effect on IO when cultural individualism is high and power distance is low, while transactional leadership is not moderated by individualism. However, when the moderating effect of power distance is integrated into the model, transactional leadership influences IO only when power distance is high. The research highlights the importance of top managements leadership style to organization-level IO across national cultures and thus encourages top management not to underestimate their role in fostering an organizations IO and to reflect carefully on their activities in this regard.",leadership| innovation orientation| national culture

We empirically estimate how the strength of patent regime influences the extent to which MNEs involve foreign scientists from a geography with weak IPR in a R&D. project.  Using a unique natural experiment that relates to the recently enacted patent reforms in India, we show that stronger patent laws do facilitate a greater division of labor of innovative activity -- stronger patent regimes increase the involvement of Indian scientists on a multinational R&D. project, conditional on the R&D. project being off-shored to an Indian R&D. subsidiary. Interestingly, strengthening patent protection has differential effects on different types of R&D. While a weak IPR at a foreign location encourages greater foreign scientist participation on a non-incremental R&D. project relative to an incremental R&D. project,  it encourages greater foreign scientist participation on a proprietary R&D. project (a project that is of high private value to the MNE but not to the participating foreign scientist) relative a non-proprietary R&D. project.

On the basis of the expansion of intellectual property rights in the last few decades which affects international business through market protection, market domination and market monopolization, the framework suggests that international business strategy is a combination of market and nonmarket approaches adopted by different firms. The use of the government as the resource would be at the macro level of the strategy formulation whereas the use of market factors would at the firm or corporate level of international business strategy. The framework can be used to understand and formulate international business strategy in cases related to different aspects of international business strategy such as the use of government subsidy in export oriented countries, role of international monetary system in international business or even in determining the entry modes of a firm and the role of governmental control on foreign direct investment.",international strategty| resource based view| roel of government

I find that spillovers driven by absorptive capacity, versus by demonstration effects, are more likely contentious as: domestic leadership is higher; outcomes are more sensitive to host country policies; and the firm dynamics, such as entry and exit, due to the spillovers are harder to observe. Thus baseline expectations of which firms lead an industry depend on the types of spillovers.",spillovers| firm and industry dynamics| entry and exit

I argue that foreigners must simultaneously handle the implications of their assets and liabilities compared to domestic counterparts. Firms that are able to internationalize have an additional deployment benefit within host markets, whereas the initial lack of embeddedness places foreigners at a relative disadvantage with regard to information gathering activities. Early attempts by foreigners to reduce their lack of embeddedness through information gathering, however, generate an additional deployment benefit for these firms. I test the analytical framework using a broad set of foreign and domestic manufacturing firms competing in Spain. The framework contributes to the internationalization strategy literature by taking a fine-grained view of specific actions intended to cope with the organizational implications of foreigners liabilities and assets simultaneously, and related changes over time. This perspective also adds new insight to the market adaptation literature by demonstrating that a changing market environment not only implies that firms adaptation abilities are important for firm success in a new market environment but also makes important the relative competitiveness of each of its adaptation activities.",deployment| foreignness as an asset or a liability| information gathering

This paper examines the tacit-rich textile and clothing industries in Italy, and argues that firms concentrations of tacit knowledge did, for some time, lead to retention of market share and jobs.  Globalization strategies, including direct ownership of facilities abroad and vertical integration at home, can be understood as new solutions to the problem of building and sharing tacit knowledge.

Do diaspora-owned firms enjoy a competitive advantage in the COO, and if so, what accounts for this?  This paper uses data from an original survey of 174 foreign-owned firms in Georgia to explore mechanisms of diaspora difference, focusing particularly on how firms use social networks in business.  I find that diaspora-owned firms use social networks more than other foreign firms in the acquisition of real estate, and that social networks are more important to their location decisions and overall profitability.  However, I find no evidence that diaspora-owned firms use social networks to resolve legal disputes.  This indicates that social networks provide important competitive advantages to diaspora-owned firms, but that most diasporans do not use these networks to substitute for formal contracting institutions (i.e. courts).  This paper also engages a literature in economic sociology that suggests that diaspora investors may be motivated by non-pecuniary incentives like patriotism and that diaspora-owned firms may therefore engage in more pro-development behaviors.  I find no evidence that diaspora-owned firms are more likely to prioritize the hiring of locals, pay above-market wages, contribute to local charity, or engage in other behaviors reflecting greater motivation to contribute to development in the COO.  However, because diaspora-owned firms use social networks in business more than other foreign-owned firms, it is possible that the level of knowledge and technology transfer from diaspora-owned firms to their local counterparts is higher than for other foreign firms.",diaspora| foreign direct investment| social networks

The data was collected from 154 SMEs and then analysed using multivariate regressions; the models used the firms export intensity at the regional, national, and international level as dependent variables. Five models were run: the first one analysing the industry where SMEs operate, the second and third ones studying state funding and ownership, and the last two analysing the internal and external barriers hindering firms expansion as independent variables. The results show that SMEs operating in Manufacture, a labour-intensive industry, have better access to international markets, that ownership and/or funding by the state does not play an important role in this expansion, and that 12 barriers related to weak management skills and knowledge are hindering the expansion of Anhuis SMEs. The findings are then analysed vis-a-vis recent works on Chinese firms from which conclusions are drawn.",china| emerging economy firms| smes national and international expansion

They generally build upon the ownership-advantage perspective. Firms can leverage their specific advantage to expand in less developed countries, where they can exploit knowledge and experience in the institutional-void business environment. However, to expand in an advanced economy, such a firm-specific advantage may lose its value when transferred. Hence, a theoretical extension is needed. This study introduces a mechanism that explains the international expansion of emerging-market MNEs to advanced economies. We propose a path-breaking change as a complementary view that aims to explain the international expansion of these firms. We argue that path-breaking change is a prerequisite step before emerging-economy firms build and leverage ownership advantages. We investigate 855 firms with 2342 observations in 18 emerging economies. These firms did not possess any foreign subsidiary in advanced economy at the beginning period of our observation. By employing multilevel analysis, we find partial empirical supports that path-breaking changes of an emerging-economy firm positively correlate with international expansion in advanced economies.",emerging-economy mnes| path-breaking change| international expansion

However, particularly East Asian studies demonstrate that organizational commitment does not evolve automatically and that the national business context significantly influences employees organizational commitment. Elaborating on the national ethical business context, we argue that national business contexts vary in their prevalence of compliance and values-based ethics. In detail, we argue that both, the level of compliance-based ethics (i.e. corporate governance) and the level of values-based ethics (i.e. humane leadership) positively influence employees organizational commitment. Even further, we argue that both types of ethical systems cross-fertilize. Based on data of 12,175 employees from 21 nations, we find support for our two main hypotheses. Testing for interactions, however, demonstrates substitutive effects between the compliance- and values-based ethical business contexts, pointing to potentially conflicting ideas behind the two approaches. As such, compliance-based approaches seem to follow a pessimistic view of mankind, while values-based approaches seem to base on a positive view. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. Elaborating a global model of national ethical business contexts, we contribute to this years conference theme by pointing to commonalities between Eastern and Western business contexts.",compliance-based ethics| employees organizational commitment| values-based ethics

I present an alternative sociopolitical approach to gaining stakeholder support. Drawing from network theory I outline three mechanisms of change in the relations between stakeholders and foreign firms. First, network ties serve as prisms that enable third parties to cognitively ascribe characteristics of known stakeholders to an unknown foreign firm with whom that known stakeholder associates, thus who the firm initially associates with, the substance of this association, and differential value of firm initiated and stakeholder initiated relations, impacts subsequent firm-stakeholder relations. Second, as ties are conduits for information about actors in the network, ties to stakeholders that maximize the volume, diversity and richness of information afforded the firm enable the firm to improve its relations. Third, the interrelationships and interdependencies among stakeholders that facilitate pretransitive (friendship) dynamics and influence dynamics improve firm-stakeholder relations. I test these hypotheses using a novel database of 38,000 stakeholder relations manually coded from 20,000 articles covering 16 foreign gold mining companies operating 21 mining projects in 16 largely emerging countries. I find support for the impact of characteristics of the stakeholder with whom the firm is tied, the firms access to voluminous information, as well as pretransitive and influence relations on firm stakeholder relations.",stakeholder strategy| multinational management| network

Developing country multinational companies (DMNCs) have gained notoriety in recent times because of their bold acquisitions in advanced economies. However, it is unknown how these acquisitions fare in comparison to acquisitions by advance economy multinational companies (AMNCs), thus limiting our ability to extend theory. We build on the resource-based view to propose that the country of origin of the firm induces it to develop particular resources at home that later affect its performance abroad. Specifically, we argue that DMNCs that buy target firms in advanced economies achieve higher performance, because they obtain sophisticated capabilities that help them upgrade their home operations. Consequently, we argue that target firms acquired by DMNCs in advanced economies have lower performance, because DMNCs extract capabilities and transfer them to their home country, while in other acquisitions target firms instead receive capabilities from the acquirer.",m&a| developing country| performance

Laamanen|Aalto U.||,,"Prior research has found that acquisitions of private firms tend to on average outperform acquisitions of public firms. It has been argued that one of the main reasons for this is that the privately held firms are not as efficiently valued as publicly held firms. Private ownership may, however, also create challenges as information asymmetry may lead an acquirer to buy lemons. This can effectively eliminate the gains from lower valuations. We regard this lemons problem particularly problematic in connection with cross-border acquisitions where information asymmetry can be high. Based on a dataset of 6763 cross-border acquisitions, we show that acquisitions of privately held firms outperform acquisitions of public firms also in the cross-border context. The magnitude of this effect is, however, moderated by two country-specific determinants. The level of financial development and the degree of transparency in the host countries increase the relative gains from acquisitions of privately held firms.

Acknowledging the tension between formal and informal institutional dimensions, we propose a relational typology of institutional distance based on the difference in any given two countries institutional profiles, considering the degree and simultaneity of both formal and informal institutions. In addition to conceptually developing our typology, we empirically test how this newly proposed relational typology affects dyadic relationships between countries involved in cross-border economic activities, more specifically, the pre-merger negotiation processes.

In terms of the drivers of international expansion, our results suggest that the degree of internationalisation varies with industrial diversification and business age in a non-linear fashion.

Adopting a field perspective of markets, in my analysis of qualitative data from interviews with organizations from the entire field, I find that institutional voids are a source of ambiguity in the creation of new markets in Tajikistan.  The results suggest that organizations that employ strategies lying in the same domain as the institutional voids are less likely to succeed in overcoming institutional voids.  Meanwhile, the incorporation of different institutional elements and utilization of existing networks in the organizational field contributes to successful new market creation.

Political institutions operate at both levels, with regulatory efficiency in improved property protection and contract enforcement aiding the profitability of technology investments, while trade and investment policies promote additional network ties.

In addressing this research gap, the present study develops a theoretical model of the influence of IO on firm performance and studies to what extent this effect is subject to national culture and the stage of socioeconomic development. The study uses 783 firms from six Western and Asian countries to validate the theoretical model empirically. Findings reveal that IOs impact on firm performance is consistently positive and that national culture does not moderate IO. Yet, the positive relationship between IO and firm performance is dependent on the stage of socioeconomic development such that the effect is stronger in countries in a more advanced stage of development. The present study shows that the positive effects of IO outweigh the negative outcomes, leading to better firm performance, so the research encourages firms, especially those operating in countries at a high level of socioeconomic development, to establish an IO.",innovation orientation| cross-cultural| firm performance

Provincial governmental owners were less likely to privatize their firms with the existence of strong local competitive but their willingness to privatize increased with large foreign direct investment projects in the province. We also found that privatization was influenced by the relative fiscal power of the provincial government.",privatization| resource depedence theory| china

The dynamism of international business dictates that firm strategy should scrutinize the viability of existing operation modes (i.e. entry mode in host markets). Predominantly the literature has been concerned with the question whether firms have adopted appropriate entry modes in host countries. Consequently, inquiry in to the continuation of an existing mode of operation or adopting a different mode of operation is limited.  Utilizing the literature on institutional theory and strategic rationale for internationalization we seek to address the following question in our paper:  What are the factors that inform operation mode change or continuation? Evidence from our case study indicates that local industry institutional environment and strategic motives for entering host country influence the firms decision to continue or change its foreign operation mode.",institutional theory| entry mode| emerging economy

With data of Chinese listed firms from 1993-2009, we investigate the net effects of cross-listings relative to domestic-listings during post cross-listing period. In order to avoid the endogeneity problem inherent in the decision of cross-listing, which might confound their post cross-listing performance, we employ the propensity score matching method. Additionally, we argue that cross-listing can be perceived as an advanced stage of internationalization, among other incremental steps of internationalization process. The findings confirm this argument by showing a U-shaped relationship between the degree of internationalization and the performance of cross-listings.",overseas listing| internationalization process

This paper addresses this paucity by integrating literature from international economics, political economy, international business and linguistics to examine the transaction costs of languages under three different measures of language closeness, Same Language, Direct Communication, and Language Distance.  While we recognize that language is both a tool in international economic transactions and a vehicle to transmit cultural values, our results point out that this tool is employed differently in international trade and in FDI.  Communication costs, for both FDI and international trade, show a hierarchy, with English the most inexpensive among major trade languages, but we find that communication costs are much more important in FDI than in international trade.  We empirically test these ideas in gravity equation models.",trade| language| foreign direct investment

Our study argues how home country national cultural dimensions can matter for the mode of entry sought by managers in cross-border acquisitions, by employing state-of-the-art frameworks on when does culture matter. By characterizing the context of the entry mode decision as a situational-moderator, we argue that the home country national culture is a determinant of the managerial perception of transaction costs. We hypothesize that each of Hofstedes national culture dimensions influence the mode of governance sought in the entry. Analyzing 1671 cross-border deals, with target country as India, shows that home country power distance is positively associated, and long term orientation is negatively associated, with the managerial seeking of hierarchical over hybrid modes.",national culture| entry mode sought| situational moderator

In this paper, we investigate specific characteristics of IJVs and the host countries in which they are embedded as determinants of directors' involvement in IJVs.  We theorize that characteristics of IJVs and their host countries shape the boards involvement due to their impact on its information needs and monitoring costs.  Empirical evidence indicates that board involvement is influenced by the number of partners involved in the collaboration and by whether the IJV is a greenfield versus an acquisitive joint venture.  We also show that IJV board involvement is lower in the presence of cultural differences and significant environmental uncertainty in the host country.  The paper concludes by providing several avenues for future research on IJV boards as an underdeveloped facet of IJV governance compared to other formal (e.g., contracts) and informal (e.g., trust) governance mechanisms.",international joint ventures| corporate governance| boards of directors

Regional cluster networks are analyzed with regards to their demographical and structural network characteristics. More specific, we investigate the formation of international ties of German dedicated biotech firms as a result of demographical network characteristics, such as the number and diversity of the network members, and structural network characteristics, such as the degree of network coalescence. We study our propositions on a longitudinal dataset of the entire population of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in the German biotech industry.

Hence, an important part of research has put an emphasis on success in terms of survival and respective key success factors for managing IJVs. Less prominent, however, are studies that see IJVs as flexible investment forms that might be changed or even be terminated once strategies and objectives of partners have changed. Moreover, stock-taking of what is currently known about the measures, contexts, and determinants of IJV exit is missing. Thus, by drawing on IJV research that either applies IJV termination or IJV longevity as a measure of IJV exit, we provide a structured overview of the contexts and determinants that influence IJV exit and discuss major implications of our findings. Amongst others, we find that research on IJV exit is dominated by associating IJV exit with failure, thus widely neglecting the underlying objectives of the partners, and that IJV exit is predominantly associated with the view of the foreign partner. We also find that only few studies differentiate their IJV exit measure into different modes of IJV termination (e.g., sell-off to a third party), which makes it difficult to precisely apply the findings in practice.",international joint venture| exit| termination

Defensively, they are compelled to increase offshore autonomy to leapfrog or avoid their weak ability to manage sophisticated foreign activities. Offensively, they delegate autonomy congruent with subsidiary information processing requirement. Our survey of 149 market-seeking EM MNEs shows that three dimensions of subsidiary information processing requirement (differentiation orientation, established network, and interdependence among subsidiaries) and two indicators of parent weakness in managing cross-border  business ( coordination capability and overseas investment stage) collectively determine the degree of  subsidiary autonomy delegation.

Our typology suggests that a subsidiary may assume one of four forms of identity, which have different degrees of divergence and salience of the identities. Subsequently, different forms of identity have implications on the parent-subsidiary relationship. For example, when there is more convergence between a subsidiarys parent-derived identity and local identity, the subsidiary is more likely to have a cooperative relationship with the headquarters.",parent-subsidiary cooperation| mutliple identities| mnc

The most recent manifestation of interest in this area is, arguably, the rapid growth of the literature on regional multinationals (RMNEs). These studies provide considerable empirical evidence of a strong home-region bias by large multinational companies. Nevertheless, these same studies are largely silent about the motivations and factors that led the managers of these firms to choose particular foreign locations in which to expand their operations. In part, this omission is due to the methodological approach favored in this literature, which consists in classifying firms into various categories depending on their footprint at a given moment in time. Our study contributes to the literature on RMNEs by carrying out a detailed analysis of the international expansion of a Fortune Global 500 company over 20 years, from its first international foray until the present. Based on this case study we develop a model that explains the prevalence of RMNEs as a result of co-evolutionary dynamics between environmental factors, managerial agency and the firms geographic scope.",co-evolutionary dynamics| geographic scope| regional multinationals

We then extend the model to include diasporans perceptions of investment advantage. We test our model and examine the degree to which financial, emotional, and social-status motivations and perceptions of diaspora investment advantage drive investment interest.

Using the varieties of capitalism viewpoint, we examine strategic options open to multinational firms operating simultaneously in liberal market economies and coordinated market economies. A holistic perspective is achieved by implementing an original ratio of institutional impact. Data are drawn from a survey of the subsidiaries of German firms in the UK and subsidiaries of British firms in Germany. Our results suggest that at the micro level the primacy of national institutions and institutional complementarity as determinants of the organizational behavior of MNCs could be overstated.

Due to the differences in the antecedents of internationalization between EM MNEs and their developed nation counterparts, EM MNEs experience the problem of legitimacy and knowledge transfer differently. These differences suggest that EM MNEs, and their subsidiaries in particular, will experience the influence of institutional distance in a way not previously addressed.

Using a unique hand collected panel dataset of publicly listed firms trading on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges in China and employing a multilevel estimation approach, we find that both the host country institutional environment and the supportive policies of the home government are directly and significantly related to the number of entries into a foreign market. We also show that a host countrys institutional environment and the home governments guidance of OFDI are substitutes.

However, research in international management has yet to examine how the subsidiary management confronts the strategic challenge posed by the condition of institutional duality. Reinterpreting the classic global integration-local responsiveness tension from the subsidiary perspective, we argue that the subsidiary possesses a hybrid identity, i.e., an identity framed by the synthesis of two distinct, often conflicting identities  an MNC identity and a host country identity. Further, we propose that changing subsidiary identity claims reflect the ongoing process whereby the subsidiary responds and adapts to the dynamic balance between multinational organization pressures and home country pressures. Using qualitative procedures, we examine the evolution of identity claims made over a period of nearly half a century by the subsidiary management at Hindustan Lever - the Indian subsidiary of Unilever Inc., one of the worlds leading MNCs in the fast moving consumer goods industry. Employing grounded theoretic techniques, we develop a process model that highlights how the coupling of manifest and latent aspects of subsidiary identity provide subsidiary managers the flexibility to respond to the dynamic character of institutional duality. An important implication for practice lies in the revival of the country manager and the possibility of subsidiary identity management becoming central to the role of the country manager.",institutional duality| organizational identity| subsidiary management

Recent research has shown that R&D expenditure volatility is positively related to firm performance, suggesting that higher levels of R&D expenditure volatility indicate effective firm-level governance of the R&D function.  Building upon that finding, this paper shows that the relationship between R&D expenditure volatility and firm performance is stronger within firms that have higher levels of information asymmetry between the firm and its investors.  This suggests that investors interpret R&D expenditure volatility as an indication that the firm is actively managing its R&D function, and that this form of information takes on more significance in the absence of better sources of evidence.  Firms may reconsider the conventional wisdom suggesting that consistent R&D expenditure conveys to investors an emphasis on R&D-based innovation.  Instead, firms can communicate to investors that R&D expenditure volatility indicates that management is proactively managing their R&D projects, and combating R&D overinvestment.",r&d expenditure volatility| information asymmetry| corporate governance

To the best of our knowledge, there are few studies that have evaluated this aspect of in-licensing and internal R&D. This research gap is surprising since the combination of the external know-how and internal R&D investments have been emphasized extensively in the technology strategy literature. We suggest a two-step model: we first test a nonlinear CES-Translog innovation production function to estimate the proper functional form among Cobb-Douglas, CES and Translog. Second, we use the estimated specification in a profit maximization model to measure the degree of complementarity or substitutability. The analysis is based on a panel data set of 94 global pharmaceutical firms active in developing new drugs between 1997 and 2005. The model is estimated using a unique and proprietary dataset built from a variety of sources. Our results suggest that internal R&D and technology in-licensing are complement activities; moreover the degree of complementarity increases over time and it is accentuated for those firms with higher level of absorptive capacity, economies of scope and past licensing experience.

Focusing on the two sets of competencies referring to corporate research and Intellectual Property (IP) we study the organizational forms connecting them in terms of their effects on patent value. Investment in internal IP counsel is found to drive value more strongly than does engagement of external IP counsel. Patent value also is found to be enhanced when firms take the level of interaction between R&D and IP to a high level of intensity. The ability to maintain and exploit high interaction intensity represents a firm-specific organizational capability. We test and confirm that when combined with high quality of firm-internal research these organizational capabilities give rise to complementarities positively affecting patent value.,organizational capability| intellectual property| science

A Resource-based Analysis,1|Ulrich Lichtenthaler|U. of Mannheim||,,"Extant research has highlighted the critical role of slack resources in internal innovation processes. In recent years, however, many firms have continued to open up their innovation processes to actively collaborate with external partners. In light of a limited understanding of the determinants of open innovation, we provide new theoretical arguments and survey data from 134 manufacturing firms to study the relationship between organizational slack and open innovation. Specifically, we build on a recent conceptual framework for open innovation and examine the impact of unabsorbed slack resources on internal and external knowledge exploration, retention, and exploitation processes. The data underscore the critical role of excess resources in open innovation. In particular, internal resource slack does not only affect internal innovation processes, but also innovation processes across a firms organizational boundaries. As such, the study also points to the complementarity of intrafirm and interfirm processes in open innovation. The results further call for breaking new ground by highlighting the need for a fine-grained examination of the impact of slack resources in innovation processes. Besides positively affecting interorganizational activities, slack positively influences internal knowledge exploration, but it negatively affects internal knowledge exploitation. Accordingly, innovation managers face an important trade-off in building up slack resources, and they need to counterbalance potential negative effects of organizational slack on internal knowledge exploitation. The findings are partly surprising, and they clarify our understanding of the role of resources in innovation. The results are particularly important in light of a renewed interest in essential enablers and barriers to opening up firms innovation processes.",open innovation| organizational slack| exploration/exploitation

However, the use of customer knowledge also has an important downside as customers may often be conservative (for many good reasons), forcing producer firms to search for new solutions along established paths, while shying away from truly new and promising opportunities. In this paper these two forces are reconciled through an argument stating that there is an inverse U-shaped relationship between the intensity of the use of customer knowledge and innovative performance. We hypothesize that the negative effect at high levels of intensity of the use of customer knowledge is offset by firms broader search strategies in terms of the breadth of external search among other sources of innovation: If firms search more broadly among several sources of innovation, they are much more likely to enjoy the benefits of customer knowledge, while avoiding important negative aspects. Overall, we find empirical support for these conjectures.",customer knowledge| external search breadth| innovation

Results suggest that the performance of open source is surprisingly robust, even in seemingly harsh environments with free riders, rival (subtractable) goods, and homogeneous participant needs. Specifically, while low rivalry improves performance, high performance is possible even with high rivalry as long as participant needs are heterogeneous. Even with a tiny core of cooperators, reasonable performance is possible as reciprocators can substitute for them. In most realistic situations, free riders matter little. Finally, heterogeneous needs are an advantage, but even homogeneous needs can be satisfied in many cases.

The term has been used to refer to commercially controlled and created proprietary software that switches partially or fully to open source licenses  an early example being Netscape and the Mozilla browser. Recently the term has come to take a different meaning, implying a deeper link between the open source movement and the tradition of IT/IS outsourcing. Thus open-sourcing has been defined as outsourcing to a global but largely unknown workforce or the servicitization of products by resources external to a company. Accepting a substantial link between open source software and its development processes and outsourcing of IT/IS activities, we analyse the characteristics of various styles of open-sourcing, and suggest when and why companies might adopt the approach. The paper presents a framework of eight open-sourcing models drawn from the open source domain and the broader literature on open source adoption. These models incorporate both the products of open source and its processes (services). We analyze our eight umbrella models through a lens of business model literature. Focusing on the varying and rather deeper emphasis of a certain kind of value creation  use value  coupled with a need to harness and manipulate operant resources (community, externalities, ecosystem strength) we clarify how open-sourcing business models differ from a more generic understanding of the role of a business model.

However, much of the prior work in this area ignores the fact that most firms protect their core inventions by using a wall or thicket of patents.  In this research we investigate the assumption that dense thickets are associated with increased value and argue that in certain contexts, porous or sparse thickets will be associated with increased value.  We hypothesize that the recency (or age) of the knowledge underlying the patent thicket and the competitiveness of the technological environment will moderate the thicket densityfirm value relationship.

Positive sales effects start to occur in sufficiently uncertain market environments only, because greater resource allocation breadth shows to carry organizational costs. However, we do find that firms can expect a net performance benefit from greater breadth if they also weed out innovation projects over time. Such selectiveness is crucial for flexibility, as it minimizes the costs of greater breadth and increases innovation performance.

Stricter enforcement of such contracts may induce firms to undertake riskier R&D projects, leading to technological breakthroughs or dead ends. Specifically, non-competition agreements reduce the risk that the firm loses the fruits of inventive activity by its employees, such that when the enforcement of non-compete covenants is stricter, firms grant corporate inventors more freedom to explore risky but high-potential research paths. This study uses data about U.S. patent applications between 1990 and 2000 to identify the impact of non-competition agreements and considers both cross-state and longitudinal variation in the enforcement of non-compete clauses.

Analyzing sources of heterogeneity, we find that the required wage premium increases with a scientists preference for publishing but decreases with the preference for money. Scientists who value publishing primarily as a currency in the labor market require a smaller wage premium, ceteris paribus, than scientists who value publishing as a mechanism to advance scientific knowledge, presumably reflecting different degrees of substitutability between publishing and pay.

The results, based on an empirical study for 270 Chinese firms, suggest that both government R&D subsidy as well as technology transfer from universities and public research institutions enhance new product development. Our results also show that although government R&D subsidy and technology transfer from universities and public research institutions has a direct impact on new product development, learning capability does mediate the relationship. Moreover, unlike direct impact on new product development suggested by prior research, our study finds that other external technology sources have a indirect impact on new product development. Particularly, this study finds that the effects of external technology sources on new product development are weakened when they receive government R&D subsidies.

Far from being simply technical in nature, such policies are often ideological innovations. This paper examines three economic policy innovations (privatization, central bank independence, and pension reform) and shows how the diffusion of these policies depended not only upon the mobility of American-trained PhD economists to adopting countries, but also the state of agreement among economists on the value of these policy innovations.  By estimating hazard models for adoption times, the effects of mobility and policy agreement are shown to explain the adoption patterns.  The implications of this analysis are to treat the creation and diffusion of economic policies within the domain of the study of innovations in general.",diffusion| innovation| economists

The use of online consumer communities has been well described, including studies of the type of consumers most likely to contribute, when collaborative or competitive approaches are most beneficial, and the type of insights offered.  However, a given approach is unlikely to be beneficial across all phases of the technology lifecycle, but there is little research that ties the potential benefits of online communities to the unique challenges at each phase.  To address this gap, we draw on prior research but set it within a context of technological evolution, so to elaborate how different arrangements of online collaboration are suitable at different phases of the lifecycle.  We further describe how firms require both community management and knowledge integration capabilities specific to each phase.

The empirical research suggests that innovative performance of these technology sourcing strategies is contingent upon various environmental factors.

We explore the innovative performance of temporal combinations of internal and external technology sourcing strategies along the era of ferment and the era of incremental change of the industry life cycle. We use the knowledge-based view in conjunction with an environmental and temporal perspective to develop our theoretical framework.  We propose that firms that internalize technology development during era of ferment and acquire from outside during era of incremental change have greater innovative performance than firms that use other temporal combinations of internal and external sourcing along the industry life cycle. Further, preadaptation during pre-era of ferment positively moderates the relationship between temporal combinations of technology sources and innovative performance.

In this paper, we extend the line of research on brand communities to the field of entrepreneurship studies by examining the conditions under which new firms emerge out of these social networks. Our empirical setting is the global LEGO brand community. As a well-known pioneering firm that is constantly experimenting with new ways of collaborating with its fan and customer base, LEGO recently invited lead users to start up new companies under its brand name. In this study, we use an explorative multiple case study design to identify patterns in this new firm creation process. Our findings show that each party derives specific returns in this entrepreneurial process: The LEGO company benefits from the identification and exploitation of attractive business opportunities and the reduction of entrepreneurial risk. At the same time, the entrepreneurial lead users benefit from brand transfer and from the crucial support of the brand community in the entrepreneurial process. Moreover, the LEGO brand community enjoys a broader range of LEGO products and services. Our findings reveal the emergence of a hybrid organizational form in which new business ideas are neither exploited solely within the boundaries of the focal producer firm, nor pursued by fully independent new firms alone. We observe that this form has not emerged from a deliberate strategy on the part of the LEGO company, but rather from the proactive and entrepreneurial behavior of entrepreneurial lead users and the brand community.",lead user| entrepreneurship| brand community

Using a sample of semiconductor firms, this research adds a new dimension to characterize partners resource profiles that identifies directly the level of knowledge complementarity of the knowledge resources, based on the usefulness of their joint use. The purpose of the study is to analyse the effects of both knowledge diversity and complementarity on innovative performance. While the study confirms a moderate level of knowledge diversity to ensure both mutual understanding and access to new knowledge, it suggests that given the level of knowledge diversity, complementarity of knowledge assets provide partners with innovative advantage.

The results show that ambidexterity is useful; simultaneously achieving high product quality (through the exploitation of existing knowledge) and high product innovativeness (through the exploration of new knowledge) is indeed possible when cross-functional new product development (NPD) teams are encouraged to learn and share knowledge concurrently. In a field study, data were collected using an online survey. Data obtained from 105 NPD teams were analyzed using structural equation modeling in SmartPLS. The results show that in a NPD context, team learning, which has traditionally been associated with exploration, has significant positive effects on both new product quality and innovativeness. Furthermore, knowledge-sharing seems to positively affect quality in a NPD context. Knowing that it is possible to develop high-quality products that are also innovative, project managers should encourage NPD team members to engage in learning and knowledge-sharing processes.",new product development| knowledge-sharing| learning

A process research study of 352 events in product innovation processes in five small firms revealed multiple logics. Quantitative analyses revealed early effectuation logic, which increasingly turns towards causation logic over time. Further qualitative analyses reveal the processes of effectuation in action: small firm product innovation processes were resource driven, stepwise, and open-ended.

This study uses a stage-wise approach to NPD cycle time to test the main and interacting effects of FFE, development and commercialization cycle times on new product performance using objective data for 399 NPD projects. The results reveal that NPD performance is only increased when all three stages of the NPD process are consistently accelerated.

Ten years!| panel data with 374 firms was collected from Taiwanese firms in the electronic industry which were publicly listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TSE) from 2000 to 2009. Our finding showed that firms do adjust their explorative and exploitative innovation activities in response to different kinds of performance feedback. In particular, when firms!| performance is above their aspiration level, they prefer to maintain their exploitative innovation and reduce their explorative innovation. We also found the majority of Taiwanese firms are risk averse, and that when their performance falls below their aspiration level, they are likely to increase their exploitative innovation activities when the performance shortfall is small. In addition, we also found that financial slack not only has a direct effect on both explorative and exploitative activities, but also has a positive moderating effect on performance feedback when the level of performance exceeds the aspiration level.The evidence from Taiwanese electronic companies corroborates and extends the behavioral theory of the firm and not only allows us to test this theory in a new empirical setting, but also enables us to incorporate important factors not considered in previous research.",aspiration level| financial slack| explorative and exploitative activities

Performance feedback theory suggests that decision makers tend to engage in riskier behaviors, such as the exploration of new knowledge, when their performance is low relative to relative to their goal or aspiration level, whereas they are inclined to build on existing technological knowledge when performing above aspirations. An analysis of the semiconductor industry from 1980 to 2002 supports these predictions and, in addition, indicates that performance feedback predictions are reinforced when performance is consistent and when firms face low variance in performance feedback formation (i.e., the variance originating from a firms peers is low).",performance feedback| behavioral theory of the firm| technology search

This study focuses on the decision process while 137 R&D managers must decide whether to abandon the previously chosen course of action or to continue in the face of probable and increasing losses in a stage gate system. Results show that visual decision aids and the advice of a consultant reduce to continue funding a losing course of action.

Consensus Formation in Multi-Firm Technology Consortia,1|Ram Ranganathan|Wharton School||,,"The ability of firms to systematically control or direct technological change is a crucial aspect of dynamic capabilities that has received limited research attention. Voluntary technology consortia that develop technical standards by consensus have become increasingly popular inter-organizational venues where firms have opportunities to shape such change and avoid costly standards wars. However, the reality of firms private and divergent interests implies that some firms may view the emergent standards as beneficial whereas others may view them as detrimental. In this paper, I take an important first step toward understanding decision-making and consensus formation within these consortia by studying the antecedents of firms strategic choices in these committees. I integrate prior research on the structure of technological knowledge and alliance networks in order to explain firms decisions to support or oppose progress towards consensus standards. By jointly analyzing the effect of two networks  technological and relational - I bring a unique pluralistic perspective to explaining a firms choices in multi-firm settings. In a prototypical technical standards consortium, my empirical inquiry reveals that although firms who have advantageous relational positions have a tendency to vote against the consensus, this effect is reversed by the extent to which the firm is technologically integrated within the community.

Vertical groups consist of stable sets of suppliers and buyers that interact regularly in a persistent pattern of exchange relations.  Such collaborations shift boundary decisions from a rivalrous choice by a single firm acting alone to a collaborative decision by the entire group.  This raises the level of analysis to the group level, and questions the validity of prior, rivalrous theories of the firm.  To examine this, we applied traditional theories of the firm to a collaborative setting. Using archival data on bridge construction project networks, we examine how project characteristics affect vertical group structure.  Specifically, we predict and find that more diverse projects led to less embedded vertical groups, with a greater number of partners and few prior relationships, whereas more uncertain projects led to highly embedded vertical groups with fewer, better known partners.",governance design| vertical groups| alliances

This exploration is of particular interest in the case of SMEs, as compared to large firms, since external links might compensate for the limitations imposed by size and lack of resources. The internal coordination capacity of the firm may also interact with formal or informal networks. We address these issues empirically, using data for 4,003 SMEs in Colombia, a developing country where many firms report zero innovations. We account for these zeros using Zero-Inflated Poisson models that allow us to identify the determinants of the probability of firms choosing a strategic innovative position, and the amount of self-reported innovative outputs. Given the extent of imitation activities in developing-country firms, a distinction is made between product innovations based on invention and on imitation.

2061,Technological Discontinuities|| Architectural Innovation|| Radical Innovation,1|Organizational Responses to Technological Discontinuities:  The Case of The ACR,1|Ricardo Gabriel Flores|UNSW||,,"A long history of organizational research has shown that organizations are affected significantly by changes in technology, especially during disruptive or discontinuous ones. Studies have repeatedly shown that incumbent organizations tend to suffer deep performance declines (and even complete demise) in the face of such changes. Researchers have devoted much attention to identifying the organizational conditions that are responsible for this persistent and widespread pattern of adaptation failure. This paper, examining the response of the American College of Radiology (ACR) to the emergence of nuclear magnetic resonance technology (NMR), aims to contribute to this literature in three distinct and significant ways. First, it focuses on a fundamentally different type of organization, a professional association (rather than the technology producers examined in most prior research). Although technologies are well known to be embedded in communities including technology producers, suppliers, customers, governmental entities, professional societies, and others actors, most prior research has focused on the responses and ultimate fate of producers alone. Little, if any research has explored the responses of professional organizations specifically. Second, the study employs a refined process methodology that identifies the individual events that make up the organizations response to technological change, as well as the overall sequence through which these events unfolded. This process approach helps to develop unique insights on how adaptation ultimately unfolds (or fails to do so). Finally, the project presents an exploration of an arguably successful case of adaptation to technological change. Though nuclear magnetic resonance imaging posed a serious threat to the ACR and its main constituents, this threat appears to have been successfully managed and overcome. Although the unique nature of the organization and the technology under study place some important limits on the generalizability of this research, its findings nonetheless provide a number of significant insights about the process through which social organizations can successfully adapt to discontinuous technological changes.",technological discontinuities| organizational adaptation| professional associations

The paper also suggests that while much emphasis has been placed on business performance as the dependent variable, a firms potential for creating new architectural knowledge can be stimulated by variations in organizational performance, and that it may be far more dependent on discontinuous and purposeful managerial interventions than is currently suggested.",architectural knoweldge| loosely coupled systems| firm performance

In this paper we unravel the concept of innovation radicalness and investigate whether there is a relationship between the dimensions of radicalness. Accordingly, we assert that novelty and impact are the two dimensions, which capture the concept of radicalness. Then, innovation novelty refers to the newness of an innovation, whereas innovation impact refers to the actual impact of an innovation on subsequent innovations. Furthermore, regarding the novelty dimension of innovation this paper distinguishes two perspectives on innovation novelty. First, the pioneering perspective on radicalness states that novel innovations do not build on prior technologies. Second, the recombinant perspective puts forward that innovation novelty is based on the recombinant nature of innovations, which is captured by the amount and diversity of technologies that the new innovation builds upon. Subsequently, we hypothesize for recombinant innovations that novelty is related to impact in a curvilinear (inverted-U shaped) manner. Next, pioneering innovations are hypothesized to result in a higher level of innovation impact as compared to non-pioneering innovations. The results, based on the analysis of patent data from the telecommunication industry, confirm the hypothesis that the recombinant novelty is curvilinear related to innovation impact. However, in case of the biotechnology patents, there is a positive relationship between novelty and impact. Furthermore, some significant differences are found between the impacts of pioneering innovations as opposed to recombinant innovations.",radicalness| novelty| impact

In order to explain why suppliers become involved in only certain of these activities this paper provides a case study analysis from the knowledge-based view of the firm (KBV). The paper shows that the opportunity to take on some certain responsibilities is based on the ability to generate and creatively combine knowledge, which in turn provides the firm with a knowledge advantage over its customers. Suppliers identify and start to exploit their opportunity because they have formulated a valuable problem for their customers, associated with sets of problem-solving approaches or solutions, which the supplier expects to be able to handle. The suppliersi?1/2 decision to act is explained by their perceived ability to exploit these new combinations of knowledge while the organization of the search depends on the complexity of the problems.

We explore this question through a framework that weighs the emergence challenges that need to be confronted by a new technology to achieve its commercial potential against the extension opportunities that are available to the old technology for performance improvements. We suggest that this balance is critical to understanding when a new technology substitutes the old technology.  In accounting for emergence challenges and extension opportunities we consider not only the focal competing technologies, but also the external technology ecosystems in which the focal technologies are developed and used.  We apply this framework to analyze the ten episodes of technology competition that have occurred in the semiconductor lithography equipment industry from 1972 to 2009. We find that our framework provides a robust explanation for the observed differences in the pace with which the new technology substituted the old one. Finally, we explore the ways in which industry participants have managed the interaction between the emergence of a new technology and the extension of the old technology to shed light on the puzzling observation that, despite many misses and delays in the commercialization of new lithography technologies, semiconductor manufacturers continued to make steady progress along the performance trajectory predicted by Mooreas law.

Observing that supplanted technological performance levels continue to be sustained by the industrys organizational populations across time, we propose two additional measures of technological evolution at the industry level, in addition to the traditional S-curve. Firstly, we propose a measure that denotes the successive increases in the lowest levels of performance supported by the industry across time, which we name the trailing-end of technological evolution. Consequently, we refer to the traditional S-curve of technological progress as the leading-end of technological evolution, as it denotes the successive increases in the highest levels of performance in the industrys general direction of technological development. Secondly, we propose the changes in the number of technological performance levels sustained by the industry, in other words the industrys overall niche width, as a further measure of technological evolution. In turn, we illustrate the applicability of the leading and trailing-end measures, as well as the changes in the industrys niche width in an empirical study of the PC game industry. Our empirical results show that in contrast to the leading-end, performance increases at the industrys trailing-end remain marginal for a long period of time. This importantly suggests that various organizational populations compete at the industrys trailing-end by manufacturing products that integrate the lowest levels of technological performance available in the industry. Following earlier research on technological evolution, we in turn draw several strategic implications for organizations that compete at the trailing-end of industries.",technological evolution| organizational niche| s-curves

The present authors examine ownership structure in terms of concentration and closeness, and its relationship to widening and deepening technology accumulation patterns resulting from R&D investment. The concentration is the ratio of large shareholder over total share, and the closeness is the degree of separation between owner and manager. The results are consistent with the ambidexterity viewpoint that widening and deepening patterns together have a positive effect on the firm performance. The concentration is negatively related to both widening and deepening perspectives, but the closeness ownership is positively related to widening technology accumulation patterns.

Three types of learning: formal classroom learning and informal self-training and task characteristics learning, were examined. A structural effect model with multiscale measures delineates the proposed learning opportunities, based on career stage and work characteristic models. The interactive effect measures are derived from implicit belief and self-efficacy theories, which stress how personal beliefs help translate external data. Tests among six technical firms in Taiwan reveal that: (1) Management development is both skill and mentality involved such that it requires proper learning effect measurements to provoke both; (2) Job position provides a measure of task characteristic learning opportunities, as well as a moderator of overall learning effects; (3) Different types of learning contribute different amounts of interactive learning opportunities and benefits; (4) The best collaborative learning occurs after engineers practice management at work, in which self-training engenders the most benefits, while the creation of these benefits depends on the task characteristics of the on-the-job learning opportunities offered by organizations; formal, off-the-job classroom training should focus on young engineers who have not had chances to learn management on the job.",interactive learning| engineering| management development
2066,Learning|| Cognition|| Technological Development,2|Effect of Technology Development Mode on Firm Performance in Emerging Economy,"1|Indrajit Mukherjee|XLRI School of Business & Human Resources, India||",,"Roles played by various modes of developing technological knowledge differ across emerging economy firms and developed economy firms. These modes are therefore expected to have different implication on performance of these two types of firms. Extant literature on technology management has developed theoretical insights on developed economy context but has hardly addressed the emerging economy context. Addressing this gap, this paper explores how different modes of technological knowledge development in emerging economies influence firm performance for an extended period of time. The multi-industry longitudinal study of 3026 manufacturing firms in India reveals: payoffs from investments in different modes of technological knowledge development occurs over an extended period of time, but are different in nature (positive vis-a-vis negative) at different points of time. The pattern of payoff depends on the dimensions of performance and on the mode of technological knowledge development. The research contributes theoretical insights into the relationship between technological knowledge development mode and firm performance in emerging economy by investigating some modes which are important in emerging economies. It also systematically explores the effect of technological knowledge sourcing on different dimensions of performance over an extended period of time. It attempts to bring out theoretical difference between the two different types of investments in R&D: capital and current, especially as it applies in emerging economy. The results also indicate that decision of shareholders follow institutionalized norms rather than rational evaluation of technology investment by firms. This may have important implications for corporate governance in relation to technology management.",technology management| emerging economy| r&d
2066,Learning|| Cognition|| Technological Development,3|Cognitive Flexibility and Technology Change,1|Nathan Furr|Brigham Young U.||,,"Although technology evolution often creates many new opportunities, both established firms and young ventures face challenges in changing their technology. As a result, although some firms are able to change their technology, many others do not. Currently there are two primary explanations for technology change: capabilities and cognition. The capabilities explanation highlights the hindering role of capability rigidities and suggests that dynamic capability can lead to greater flexibility and technology change. The cognition explanation also highlights the role of rigidity, specifically cognitive rigidity, in the failure of many firms. However, the cognition literature has not robustly explored how cognition can facilitate change. In response, this paper proposes the concept of cognitive flexibility and investigates the impact of three constructs that contribute to cognitive flexibilitycognitive variety, novelty and framingon when firms change their technology. The effects of cognitive flexibility on making major (architectural) technology change are investigated in an empirical study of the population of U.S. solar photovoltaic ventures. The results of this investigation suggest that all three cognitive flexibility constructs: variety, novelty, and framing contribute to technology change. Furthermore, this study also investigates the link between making technology changes and performance and finds that a firms willingness to make major technology changes results in improved performance.",change| cognition| entrepreneurship

Based on social network theory, the knowledge-based view, and organizational learning theories, this study examines how a firmas knowledge-processing capability affects knowledge creation that results from bridging structural holes in a network. The theoretical model was tested on a sample of 191 firms across various high-technology industries. The dependent variable, the rate of knowledge creation, was measured by the number of patents. Results show that when a firm spans multiple structural holes, its technological diversity facilitates knowledge creation. However, spanning structural holes is related to less knowledge creation when a firm already possesses a well-developed knowledge acquisition capability, suggesting that spanning structural holes and internal knowledge acquisition capability are substitute mechanisms for the firmas external knowledge search.",social network| the knowledge-based view| innovation

Lawrence|U. of California, Los Angeles||",,"How do innovators acquire formal organizational support for their early stage ideas? Innovations rarely fit well with an organizations strategy, structure, resources or institutionalized patterns of thought (Chandy & Tellis, 2000; Dougherty & Hardy, 1996). High potential ideas are often weeded out at nascent stages because they challenge existing thought. Previous researchers have suggested that innovators succeed when they influence how audiences understand the meaning of their innovation (Dougherty & Heller, 1994; Hargadon & Douglas, 2001). Shaping how audiences understand the meaning of an innovation can be accomplished through several methods such as framing (Benford & Snow, 2000; Goffman, 1974) and general influence tactics such as assertiveness, ingratiation and coalitions (Kipnis, Schmidt & Wilkinson, 1980).  Here we explore how innovators construct meaning by engaging in sensegiving (Gioia & Chittipedi, 1991) to move their innovation from ideation to adoption.	To address our research question we use data collected from innovators and senior managers within Silicon Valleys high technology industry. Data were collected from 14 firms ranging in age from 12 to 114 years, with annual revenues for 2008 from approximately $5 to $105 billion and an employee base of 10,000 to 150,000. In contrast to previous research, which suggests that successful innovators either conform to (Hargadon & Douglas, 2001) or alter meanings (Dougherty & Heller, 1994), we find that innovators promoting nascent ideas present their projects as completely aligned yet different from their organizations extant schema. They present their innovations as optimally distinct (Brewer, 1991) through the use of narratives, symbols and timing of their sensegiving strategies.",nascent innovations| sensegiving| meaning management

We use both bibliometric and article content analysis of 199 items of management literature and 5060 references in them published between 1990 and 2009 to find out the reasons for this persistent divide. We observe that there are three distinctive schools of thought (innovation, network, and core business element) who use the concept of business model in different ways.

Different authors conceptualize the ecosystem in different ways and for different purposes, resulting in conceptual differences in ontology and semantics that are a potential source of confusion, and can hamper the comparability of studies.  This paper seeks to make those differences explicit and provide a vocabulary for clarification and further discussion.  We find that authors employ the business ecosystem concept in one or more of three conceptually different ways: (1)i?1/2as a metaphor for shaping managerial thinking and action, (2)i?1/2as a label to classify or describe a category of management phenomena, or (3)i?1/2as an analogy for theory-building.  Next, we discuss the ambiguities, contradictions, implications, and contribution of each of these three forms.  Finally, we find that ecosystem constructs in the literature may differ along at least four dimensions: (1)i?1/2conceptual space, (2)i?1/2anchor point, (3)i?1/2boundaries, and (4)i?1/2elements.  We argue that authors could improve the clarity of their arguments by explicitly stating their own position, and we offer the frameworks developed here as a common vocabulary to anchor those discussions.",innovation| strategy| modular organizational design

Drawing on in-depth analysis of the processes to adopt new technologies in the Heathrow Terminal 5 project, we examine the determinants of technology adoption. We find that these decisions are governed systematically by the interaction of three main factors: anticipated profitability, absorptive capacity, and multilateral agreement among stakeholders. Decision outcomes, however, are also affected by other factors on an ad hoc basis, including risk-aversion attitude, established standards, and expert involvement. Our central contribution is to reveal how the project timescale creates an underlying boundary condition that constrains the decision-makers time to build the capacity to absorb novel technologies, assess their profitability, and negotiate multilateral agreements on their adoption. The potential of major infrastructure development projects to innovate a large socio-technical system is therefore subjected to a fundamental and unifying tension: on the one hand, these projects create a one-off opportunity to adopt cutting-edge technologies that modernize the system; on the other hand, a constrained timescale has a negative impact on their innovation potential. This can compel the project stakeholders to agree multilaterally upfront to adopt proven technologies in order to reduce uncertainty and downside risks.",innovation| infrastructure| technology adoption

We collected data from 244 coordinated networks in Germany and analyzed the sample by means of factor analyses, cluster analyses and qualitative comparative analyses (QCA). The results show that process standardization (formal planning) as a coordination method is a necessary condition for innovativeness, while self-regulation and centralization are less important and only effective in combination with process standardization.

In their quest to shape and produce technology specific supportive structures, institutional entrepreneurs have to make strategic choices regarding which types of networks to join and which activities to support at the system level. This paper informs innovating firms and policy makers about the abilities of different innovation networks. We apply concepts from the resource based view and empirically analyze which resources formal innovation networks have at their disposal to facilitate the build-up of a novel field. Networks rely on the organizational resources of their members (financial resources, expertise, firm reputation, etc.) but also on new, so-called network resources (governance structures, a common understanding of strategic goals, trust among members, reputation of the network etc.). Formal networks can be differentiated according to whether they primarily use organizational resources or mostly rely on specific network resources. We observe that the latter type of networks has been very influential and substantially contributed to establish and shape the technological field.",network resources| emergent technological fields| interogranizational networks

Using a multiple agency perspective, we explore how the preferences, resources, and influence of corporate investors vis-a-vis their IVC co-investors affect the innovativeness of new ventures. We develop the premise that corporate investors generally place greater value on having their new venture investees focus on innovation than do IVC investors, because a corporate investor can benefit disproportionately from technological synergies with investees  possibly at the expense of other rent creating activities that favor IVC capital gains. Because corporate investors can efficiently provide complementary resources supporting their preference for innovative investees, we suggest that new ventures partially funded by corporate investors will become more innovative than those ventures funded solely by IVCs. We maintain that the innovation levels of new ventures are further enhanced when their corporate investors are highly reputable relative to their IVC co-investors, granting them greater influence to promote their preferences. Based on a sample of 508 computer, wireless, and semiconductor ventures, we found an ordering pertaining to new venture innovativeness. Those new ventures that are funded solely by IVCs were least innovative, whereas those funded in part by relatively influential corporate investors (vis-a-vis their IVC co-investors) were most innovative.",multiple agency theory| innovation| corporate venture capital

However, existing research shows that technological diversitys direct correlation with the impact of specific innovations is negative. How can technological diversity improve financial performance if it impedes the quality of innovation? Drawing on theory about knowledge search and transfer, we maintain that technological diversity affects firms absorptive capacity: firms are more likely to use distant, recent and more knowledge elements in their inventions when they are more technologically diverse. Evidence from patent data for a large, economy-wide sample of US firms shows that technological diversity may not directly improve innovation quality, but it does so indirectly, through the use of more, distant knowledge elements (but not more recent). Moreover, technological diversity helps firms get more impact from those more distant, recent, and extensive knowledge elements.

We investigate alliances between firms that produce IT and firms that invest in IT using the ecosystem perspective, which we enrich with insights from transaction cost economics and absorptive capacity. We find that performance of IT-producing firms, in terms of profitability and innovation output, improves with more alliances with IT-investing firms. However, profitability of IT-producing firms declines as their IT-investing partners form more alliances with other IT-producing firms, and as their IT-investing partners become more IT-intensive.

In collaborating around virtually-mediated knowledge objects, various groups compete to define the meanings attached to those objects, in order to define the importance and legitimacy of various forms  of organizational knowledge and thus control organizational roles, structures, and processes. This study analyzes how representational, technical, and organizational resources provide a mediation of knowledge and influence between different work-groups and how different forms of negotiated mediation lead to the adaptation of the information systems that collaborating workgroups define and use in common.

This research further develops the concept of monochronicity and polychronicity and enriches the understanding of the impacts of IT on monochronicity and polychronicity. This research also is of practical significance as its findings can help formulate guidelines to implement IT in organizations and facilitate the management of IT-induced behavioral and attitudinal changes in organizational work and organizational members.Paper is No Longer Available Online: Please contact the author(s).",

Extending deliberative democracy theory to understanding CSR phenomena presents major theoretical and normative challenges. Deliberative democracy relies on certain assumptions about background equality, willingness to reciprocally deliberate, and institutional environment that might hold in certain political contexts but which do not in most manifestations of CSR. Deliberative understandings of CSR are thus both inaccurate as descriptive management theory as well as potentially dangerous when applied to real-world CSR.",deliberative democracy| corporate social responsibility| discourse ethics

Sourcing from both the critical scholarly literature and a detailed and regrettably representative case study, this paper illustrates systematic undermining of and even violence against healthy subsistence communities that constitutes an essential but often invisible part of what mainstream management scholarship extols as globalization.  The paper attempts to enter into what Paul Farmer (2005) calls pragmatic solidarity with communities threatened by globalization  a position that demands that theoretical understanding and active solidarity mutually guide and support each other.  Where Farmer (2005) develops public health theory and practice to include the treatment of pathologies of power (structural violence and violations of human rights), this paper seeks to extend Farmers framework beyond treatment into the prevention of structural violence toward still-healthy communities.  At the same time, efforts to prevent structural violence will fail (or worse) if they do not recognize and correct a vital conflation in the modernist understanding of poverty, since this conflation frequently results in aid efforts that unwittingly perpetrate structural violence.  General points regarding both theory and the need for pragmatic solidarity (Farmer 2005) are then grounded in a case study of an Afro-descendent community in Colombia that is healthy but is under imminent threat of catastrophic structural violence.",globalization| structural violence| change

Empirical material consisting of 52 stories of workplace stress is examined from a psychoanalytic, particularly Lacanian perspective. From this perspective the experience of stress seems to entail the construction and subsequent failure of various fantasies of the self and how the self obtains its desires in and through work. Moreover, the discourse of stress is variously appropriated in the construction of the self to experience the liberation from such fantasies as they fail and the subjugation to fantasies as they are repaired. As such, the experience of stress may be both liberation from and submersion in conscious, imaginary orders of self, work and organization.",stress| stories| psychoanalysis

We suggest relational leadership requires a way of engaging with the world in which the leader holds herself/himself as always in relation with, and therefore morally accountable, to others.  In particular, this means recognizing the inherently polyphonic and heteroglossic nature of life, engaging in relational dialogue, and encompasses practical wisdom. Our contribution is both conceptual and practical: conceptually we offer a different dimension to theorizing leadership as a social practice, and practically we draw attention to features of relationships that can sensitize leaders to the impact of their actions and interactions and to the nature of their relationships with others.",relational practice| dialogic| leadership

Curiously, organizational theory has nothing much to say on this. It has all but stopped exploring how organizations affect the pattern of privilege and disadvantage in society and only fitfully considers how privilege and disadvantage are distributed within organizations (Hinings & Royston, 2002: 411). A critical theoretical perspective on age in organizations is overdue. The aim of this paper is therefore to bring age as a central analytic category into organization studies by theorizing whether organizations, as well as being gendered, could also be aged. We argue that current rhetorical silence in respect of age contributes to the maintenance of the ideology of old(er) age as decline and of societal and organizational age structures which are seen as natural and normal.Our approach is informed by Ackers (1990) theory and explores considerations raised in subsequent gendered organization research including matters of ghettoization and epistemology. Our focus is the aged nature of organizations and the way in which they reproduce structures which are not age neutral. Organizations (and related concepts such as occupations and career) are aged in that they are symbolically and ideologically described and conceived in terms of a discourse that draws on hegemonically defined differences between old and young.",age| theory| critical

Rundshagen|Cologne Business School||,,"This paper contributes to the reflection on business schools and the education they provide - an urgently needed step according to many scholars (Currie, Knights, & Starkey, 2010). There is a contemporary anxiety about failing academic students (Blake, Smeyers, Smith, & Standish, 2000), and critical accounts of business schools' responsibility in the wake of crises and corporate scandals (e.g. Ghoshal, 2005; Mintzberg, 2004) are offered. Embedded into the social theory frameworks of late and post modernity, emphasizing consumption and entertainment as major driving forces of society, this paper applies Brymans (1999, 2004) phenomenon of Disneyization to the case of a German private business school. A wider, if certainly not universal, validity of the findings is assumed, against the backdrop of globalisation of higher education (e.g. Mok, 2003; Naidoo, 2003). The analysis shows that all dimensions of Disneyization are prevalent at business schools and that there are far-reaching implications for the institutions, faculty and staff, and students, as well as their interaction. It is suggested that a dichotomisation of meaningful versus entertainment-driven education is not justified per se, as long as the latter does not replace the first.

In analysing the crisis, much interest has been taken in the role of bankers, traders, regulators and politicians (e.g. Zuckerman, 2009; Lewis, 2010; Tett, 2010) .Comparatively little consideration has been given to how the public has made sense of, and reacted to, the crisis; and, more specifically, to those whom Goffman (1952, see opening quotation) terms the `marks and how they (we) have been `cooled out. The `marks or `suckers (Goffman, 1952: 451) have, during the extended boom that preceded the meltdown placed their trust in the financial system which reciprocated by providing easy credit and increases in asset prices, notably in property (Glyn, 2006) that offered compensation for sluggish wage increases (Watson, 2009b). Borrowers/investors increased their loans to support their consumption in line with the expectation of continuing asset price rises Facilitated by an inflow of cheap money from saving nations, notably China, consumption in developed economies, especially the US and UK, was fuelled by broadening participation in financial markets enabled by new financial instruments (Hildyard, 2008; see Exhibit 1). An endless boom was in prospect, with no more bust. The first section of the paper sketches key components of our conceptual framework. In the second section, we present a brief overview of the run-up to the financial crisis of 2007 as this is the equivalent of the period when the `mark is `given an opportunity to invest his money in a gambling venture which he understands to have been fixed in his favor (1952: 451). The `venture of financialization, we argue, was propelled by a fantasy of no more boom and bust. The venture was, as Goffman (1952: 451) puts it, `fixed, but not in [the marks] favour. In the third section, we address the specifics of a dominant fantasy distilled in calls for an end to greed and a promise of `prudent banking accompanied by a `pay-back to UK taxpayers. These fantasies, we argue, help to account for why widespread private expressions anger about the financial meltdown have not (at the time of writing) translated into organized public dissent and collective demands for radical change.  Finally, we turn to the role of United Kingdom Financial Investments (UKFI) in `cooling out the marks (Goffman, 1952: 451) where we note how features of financialized capitalism  notably, the idea of `shareholder value and `arms-length management  have become recuperated in UKFIs its terms of reference and the Government White Paper Reforming Financial Markets.",financial crisis| cooling out| regulation

Whilst supportive of this approach, I suggest that its development to date lacks a meaningful engagement with perhaps the most important stakeholder of all  the public.  Communication between academics and a wider public is attributed little value because of a narrow conceptualisation of how academic knowledge is best disseminated to users.  I propose a broader understanding of this process and illustrate its value through a case study of the contribution of New Zealand business school academics to public understanding of the global financial crisis (GFC).  Academics were perceived as an independent source of expertise in contrast to other experts prominent in media coverage, many of whom represented the interests of financial institutions at the heart of the crisis.  I conclude by suggesting that having business school academics more active in sharing their knowledge with a wider public can serve both the interests of the public and business schools themselves.",business school| global financial crisis| public interest

Developmental readiness is here construed somewhat differently as having self-awareness, self-regulation, and self-motivation as its key underlying dimensions. These dimensions are argued to encompass the dimensions proposed by Avolio and Hannah (Avolio & Hannah, 2008; 2009; Hannah & Avolio, 2010). Developmental readiness is suggested to moderate the developmental process, and this was supported in the analysis. Furthermore, personality dispositions and individual values were suggested to be precursors to developmental readiness, which was also supported. This longitudinal study was conducted within a formal and executive education context. Finally, implications for theory and practice are discussed as well as directions for future research.",developmental readiness| leadership development| personality and values

Such claims have found support from companies and from academics. However, an investigation of students perspectives on this issue and the question of whether students expect and perceive their almae matres to provide guidance for their future work life by shaping their values has yet been missing. In this contribution we discuss value influencing on management students by academia and we link students expectations and perceptions to their own personal values and to their satisfaction with their academic institution. For a sample of 191 students from a German university, we show that management students expect more value influence than they actually perceive to be delivered by their institution. Further, this expected value influence is associated with universalism (self-transcendence) values, but not with power (self-enhancement) values. Finally, students perceptions of delivered value influence increase the students satisfaction with their institution. Results imply that institutions should formally coordinate opportunities to discuss and to shape values, particularly with regard to more universalism values.",values| socialization| management education

CQ refers to individual's abilities and skills to effectively manage interactions in cross cultural situations and, as such, is a crucial competence for successful international managers. Using matched samples, in two multination longitudinal pre-post studies, we assessed the effects of academic cross-cultural management (CCM) courses on students CQ and found that at Time 2, all four CQ dimensions were significantly higher than in Time 1. No effects on CQ were detected in the control group, where students worked in nationally mixed teams but did not take a CCM course. We also found that a distal cross-cultural capital factor, prior living overseas, significantly and positively related to CQ.

Using a large panel data set at country level, this study explores the determinants of international student mobility in UK higher education, factors that have been largely unaddressed in the literature to date. The empirical results generated from the Generalised Least Squares (GLS) model suggest that home country economic wealth and population, relative exchange rate, bilateral trade and historic/linguistic links and the UK government policy are the most significant determinants for the UK international student inflows. More importantly, the study finds that these determinants are heterogeneous between the developed and developing home country groups due to their difference in economic development level.

We find that applicants who have high grades due to more lenient grading practices are more likely to gain admission to graduate school. The results suggest that high grades are taken as evidence of high ability and not discounted by the ease with which they were achieved.

The model is centered on two pillars:  1) the cognitive frames used by the key players involved in the change to interpret information about the nature, strategy and implementation conditions of change; 2) the processes by which these frames evolve during the phases of change. Findings show that the two organizations exhibit significant differences in the content and the structure of the frames adopted by change participants, which shape different paths of framing in the two cases. The formal structure of the organization is also found to influence the dynamics of framing.

Based on a longitudinal case study of a large European postal companys development over a period of 15 years, we find that the quality of diversity between different managers mental models has a significant influence on the dynamics of the collective sensemaking process. When managers agree on basic beliefs but disagree on derived beliefs, collective sensemaking can produce extreme biases.

This conceptual paper presents an analysis and critique of collective schema change dynamics. Two schema change pathways are reflected in the literature: frame-juxtapose-transition and frame-disengage-learning. Research findings in each pathway are limited and/or contradictory. Moreover, research on schema change focuses primarily on social dynamics and less on the relationship between social schema change dynamics and individual schema change dynamics. One implication of this lack of focus on individual schema change dynamics is the masking of the high level of cognitive processing and cognitive effort required by individuals to effect schema change. The capacity to achieve organizational transformation requires that more attention is given to managing these dynamics, which, in turn, requires significant investment in developing the change leadership capabilities of managers and the organizations they manage.",schema change| change leadership| organizational cognition

Using a sample of U.S banking firms, we examine the role of managerial cognition in the organization's speed of external crisis recognition in the period leading to the U.S. subprime meltdown. The results suggest that top managers who allocate more attention towards the future and the firm's external environment are associated with faster recognition of a crisis, while those who express higher levels of certainty are associated with slower recognition times. Consequently, firms that recognized the crisis more quickly managed to avoid financial distress for longer period of time.

In addition, anger attribution plays a significant role in influencing the outcome of anger expression. Anger attributed to external causes resulted in a number of positive outcomes, such as resolving the anger-eliciting event more effectively, increasing the anger expressers long term career prospect, and maintaining a positive relationship. Lastly, anger intensity moderated the effect of anger attribution. Tempered anger attributed to external causes is most likely to lead to positive outcomes.

Finally, our findings suggest that crying is commonly identified as a prohibited behavior in scripts for stressful work situations and leads observers to make negative attributions of criers (i.e., that they are unprofessional, weak, and occasionally, manipulative) in accordance with script parameters.

Identifying this response connects regret to the cognitive nature of institutionalism. Doing so, the paper addresses the lack of specific attention to meaning systems in institutional theory, and the silence in regret research on broader institutional outcomes, explaining how divergent organizational responses can occur in similar institutional contexts.",institutionalization| regret| change

Instead, employees must frequently interrupt their work flow to attend a meeting, answer a colleague or clients request, or make some progress on another project that needs attention. While existing research has shown an increased interest in studying interruptions, it only provides a partial understanding of their performance implications. Current studies have focused on how interruptions affect the work activities that get interrupted. By contrast, performance effects on the interrupting tasks have not been considered. Yet, it is unclear whether people are able to cognitively disengage from on-going work once it is interrupted to fully focus and perform well on an interrupting task. This paper addresses this gap. As revealed by a series of five experiments, the attention devoted to an interrupting task and the performance on that task depend on the conditions under which people expect to later resume the work that got interrupted and that they had to temporarily put aside. More specifically, people who anticipate resuming interrupted work under high as opposed to low time pressure find it more difficult to cognitively disengage from that work and turn their attention to the interrupting task, such that their performance on the interrupting task suffers. This paper explores the mechanisms explaining these effects as well as how to alleviate them.",interruption| attention| time pressure

The identification of these practices enable a deeper understanding of the managerial implications associated with these communities, thereby shifting the away from a stylized view of management to focus on the actual behavior and practices of managers.  As outlined in our study, these individuals structure spontaneity by developing practices to meet the conflicting expectations of their roles that arise from an organizational hierarchy whose support, or at least acquiescence, is crucial to the communitys continued existence.

In this article, we develop a more nuanced view of cognitive diversity/sharedness that distinguishes between cognitions held at implicit and explicit levels. The central argument is that because individuals posses independent implicit and explicit beliefs relating to a task, group members can hold similar explicit mental models while simultaneously possessing dissimilar implicit representations. Drawing on a contemporary dual system view of cognition, we theorize the consequences for group process and performance when: (i) members hold similar explicit mental models but dissimilar implicit beliefs (illusory concordance), and (ii) when members hold similar implicit beliefs but divergent explicit mental models (surface discordance). The analysis yields various propositions concerning the effects of illusory concordance and surface discordance on group decision making (i.e. alternative generation, group consensus, and commitment to choices) and group coordination (i.e. cohesion and interdependence in task performance). We discuss the implications of our analysis for measuring shared cognition in organizations and developing cognitive heterogeneity/ homogeneity in work groups and teams and outline potential directions for future research on the interaction among implicit and explicit cognition.",shared mental model| group| dual-system

Under challenging goals, firms engage in greater problem driven search, attempting to discover strategies for achieving their targets. As a result of their extensive search, decision makers managing firms with challenging goals develop more diverse mental models and employ a greater variety of strategies than do managers of firms faced with moderate goals. These findings provide evidence that the greater dispersion in performance outcomes for firms with challenging goals is driven by higher diversity in mental models.

We found that although maximizers expected themselves to outperform others much more than satisficers, they actually forecasted more poorly. Hence, on net, they were more overconfident. The differences in forecasting abilities seem to be driven by the maximizers tendency to give more variable probability estimates. In Study 3, participants played a betting task where they could select between safe and uncertain gambles linked to World Cup outcomes. Again, maximizers did more poorly and earned less. This research contributes to the growing literature showing that maximizing is not necessarily a desirable trait. There may be substantial upside to being a satisficer.",maximizer| prediction accuracy| overconfidence

Analysis of a questionnaire survey of 137 business units in 21 Japanese firms reveals that while the upward flow of strategic ideas tends to be affected by organic and employee-oriented factors, the upward flow of operational problems is predominantly influenced by factors related to mechanistic management systems and to a superior's power.

We conducted two experimental studies wherein we assessed participants emotional stability and randomly assigned them to a high or low power condition. After task completion participants received negative performance feedback. In line with our hypothesis, we found in both studies that, with higher levels of emotional stability, only high power individuals were less likely to experience anger and shame in response to negative feedback. Our data also show that anger towards the feedback provider, contrary to shame and self-directed anger, mediates the interactive effects of emotional stability and power on liking and perceived ability of the feedback provider and feedback acceptance.Our results point to the importance of personality in high power individuals feedback reactions.

To answer these questions, we develop and test a theoretical framework that integrates leader-member virtual communication, member cultural orientation, and perceived inclusion in decision-making to predict workgroup identification. Findings from a multi-level investigation based on sample of 234 virtual team members embedded in 41 virtual teams suggests that dyadic leader-member virtual communication directly and indirectly influences workgroup identification.

I then turn to longitudinal data collected on the use of a new computer simulation technology in two engineering groups at a major U.S. automaker that show how the technological artifact was used by engineers for more than three months during which time they enacted various idiosyncratic technologies-in-use but brought no change to their work behaviors and consultation (advice-seeking) networks. Initially, divergent uses of the technological artifacts material features by engineers in both groups precluded them from being able to coordinate their work in ways that allowed them to structure their consultation networks differently. Eventually, engineers in only one of the two groups converged on the use of a common set of the technological artifacts material features to enact a shared technology-in-practice. This convergence was necessary to turn the technology into a resource that could collectively alter the groups work and, consequently, the structure of its consultation network. From these findings, I induct the concept of a collective affordance to explain when technology use is likely to bring changes to peoples work and communication networks and why even a widely used technological artifact may not ever bring about organizational change. I discuss implications of these findings for the emerging sociomaterial approach to technology and organizing.",technology| organizational change| networks

Recently, Parboteeah, Hoegl, & Cullen (2008) identified five weaknesses with previous research they believe explain the inconsistent results.  Similarly, Weaver and Agle (2002) argued that the absence of appropriate theoretical frameworks and exclusion of several key religious attitude measures including religious motivation orientation (intrinsic RMO vs. extrinsic RMO), perceived sacred qualities of work (sanctification), and views of God (loving vs. punishing) are responsible for the inconsistent findings.  We addressed the five weaknesses raised by Parboteeah et al. (2008) and adopted the symbolic interactionist framework and key religious attitude measures identified by Weaver and Agle (2002).  Consistent with symbolic interactionism theory, intrinsic RMO and having a loving view of God were both negatively related to endorsing a set of 29 ethically-questionable vignettes whereas extrinsic RMO was positively related to endorsing the vignettes.  Unexpectedly, sanctification was positively related to endorsing the vignettes.

The major arguments are about the imprecision and obscurities in 1. Defining the concept, and 2. Dimensions of the concept. This paper is an attempt to clarify these philosophical disputes to provide a safe ground for researchers, organizational analysts and practitioners. The paper draws arguments from the Indian Ethos in Management to clarify the imprecision and obscurities in the philosophical foundations of the concept of workplace spirituality.",spirituality| workplace spirituality| indian ethos
2157,,2|Ancient Texts of the East and West: Toward a Model of Global Social Responsibility,"1|Jennifer Jones|Duquesne U.||2|Prashanth Nagendra Bharadwaj|Indiana U., Pennsylvania||",,"Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is growing as an integral part of the vision, mission, and strategy of organizations around the world. However, the motivation for CSR and the models of CSR vary among these organizations and in the organizational literature. With the ever-increasing global reach of multinational corporations combined with their capability to address poverty, there is a need to develop a model of global social responsibility that moves the business model toward positive social change. This paper uses a philosophical hermeneutic approach to propose a preliminary model of global social responsibility. The model is based on two well-accepted and time-tested ancient texts from Greece (Aristotles Nicomachean Ethics) and India (The Baghavad Gita). The article not only provides a relevant summary of these two texts but also highlights how they relate to the instrumental, relational, and moral framework of CSR provided by Aguilera et. al (2007). The paper is an earnest first step at taking an in-depth look at two of the ancient works from the East and the West as they relate to modern organizations. The implications of this line of research and the potential for future research are immense, some of which are highlighted at the end of this paper.",corporate social responsibility| social change| ancient philosophy

The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, to describe the state of the art of spiritual leadership (SLp) in the West and identify some of the challenges facing this field. Second, to propose a framework on Islamic spiritual leadership from a scriptural perspective in an attempt to shed some light on this phenomenon in the Muslim countries.",islamic leadership| spiritual leadership| west & east

(Jody) Fry|Texas A&M U. - Central Texas||,,"This paper aims to systematically explore the underlying assumptions as well as the rationale of the main trends regarding Spirituality and religion in the Workplace (SRW). We aim to give an overview of the field and a recommendation for ways in which it needs to develop in the future. We first briefly describe the history of the efforts to integrate spirituality and religion into the workplace. Next we provide a review of the recent literature on SRW and highlight the major integrative and empirical work in this arena to date. Then, particular challenges associated with integrative work in SRW are examined. Finally, recommendations to advance integrative work in SRW are offered.Paper is No Longer Available Online: Please contact the author(s).In this study, current performance appraisals were analyzed to examine the question of whether Christian values and attitudes referred to as the Fruit of the Spirit are being measured and rewarded in the workplace.  These values and attitudes, taken from the Biblical book of Galatians (5:22-23), are specifically: Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.    Comparable attitudes and values examined in the management literature have been linked to positive outcomes such as  performance, advancement, leadership, satisfaction and many others (Barrick & Mount, 1991, DeNeve & Cooper, 1998; Judge, Higgens, Thoresen & Barrick, 1999; Seibert & Kramer, 2001; Boudreau, Boswell Judge & Bretz, 2001, Seibert & Kramer, 200; Judge, Bono, Ilies & Gerhardt, 2002; Judge, Heller & Mount, 2002).  A preliminary study which content analyzes current performance appraisal instruments suggests that some of these fruit characteristics are regularly reflected, while others are much less commonly represented.  This research suggests that these characteristics are important for organizations when hiring, developing and promoting employees and it would benefit the workplace if more objective measures were created in the future.",fruit of the spirit| performance management| workplace spirituality

2158,,3|Teaching Spirituality and Work,1|David Trott|I-Shou U.||,,"The primary purpose of this paper is to present a case-study that focuses upon teaching spirituality and work.  This paper presents a teacher-observers vantage point of one course taught 23 times from June, 1997 to- June, 2009.  Spanning 12 years, the course was offered to nearly 350 working adult-students who were attending evening classes.  The author will provide an overview of classroom scholarship that specifically illuminates effective teaching techniques and enriching learning activities.  The paper will have two voices engaging in a praxis-oriented self-dialogue: first, the authors narrator voice will primarily engage in reportage of details, examples, and fine points; second, the authors inner voice will offer reflective, personal glimpses and queries aloud.  Grounding and expounding workplace spirituality in a classroom setting is not easy, but it is doable, highly beneficial and invigorating when done well.  By drawing upon innumerous experiences from the course, it is hoped that the insights from this case-study might serve as a starting point and/or a refreshing booster for classroom teachers and researchers across the management, spirituality and religion domain.",teaching| case-study| spirituality
2159,,"1|Present State of Workplace Spirituality: Literature review of context, theory, & scales/measurements",1|David W. Miller|Princeton U.||2|Tim Ewest|Wartburg College||,,"This paper seeks to review the growing body of qualitative and theoretical research on the field of workplace spirituality, with particular attention to determining the nature, aims, and unmet needs specific to scale development for spirituality in the workplace and faith at work.  Extending the earlier and broader literature review work of Gorsuch and Miller (1999), Hill and Hood (1999), the Fetzer Group (1999), Moberg (2002), Mohamed, et al (2004), Day (2004), and Lund Dean and Fornaciari (2007), this paper also seeks to advance the direction of future psychometric scale development in the burgeoning and interdisciplinary academic field of workplace spirituality and faith at work. By suggesting a new rubric for understanding the literature (manifestation, development, and adherence), and analyzing the scale validity and reliability the authors hope to expand the conceptual imagination for new scale research. Specifically, this paper argues that the previous research has begun to address important aspects of research scale development, although it has been limited in its applicability to workplace contexts, does not address diverse religious traditions, and falls short of understanding how and the degree to which individual or collective spirituality integrates and manifests itself in the workplace.  Moreover, while much scale research has been directed towards personal fulfillment, faith maturity and wellness (Hill and Hood, 1999; Moberg, 2002), only recently have scales been developed with an eye towards workplace spirituality and faith at work. To this end, this paper will codify and extend the aforementioned work by identifying the major drivers for the field, consider the present operationalized definitions, explore the theoretical connections between spirituality/religion and organizations, review existing scales and instruments, discuss the literature review findings , identify gaps and problems within the reviewed research, and resolve by suggesting specific areas for further research.",spirituality| religion| work| scales| measurements| literature review
2159,,"2|Empathy, Connectedness and Organization",1|Kathryn Pavlovich|U. of Waikato||2|Keiko Krahnke|U. of Northern Colorado||,,"In this paper, we conceptually explore the role of empathy as a connectedness organizing mechanism.  We expand ideas underlying positive organizational scholarship and examine leading-edge studies from neuroscience and quantum physics that give support to our claims.  The perspective we propose has profound implications regarding how we organize and how we manage.  First, we argue that empathy enhances connectedness through the unconscious sharing of neuro-pathways that dissolves the barriers between self and other.  This sharing encourages the integration of affective and cognitive consciousness which facilitates the ability to find common ground for solution-building.  Second, empathy enhances connectedness through altruistic action.   In giving to others, feelings of joy and harmony are activated.  This in turn allows personal freedom to be enriched and transcendence from the rational ego-self is reduced to develop a more expansive, integrated and enlightened state underlying connectedness.  Finally, empathy enhances connectedness which results in sharing the quantum field of coherence where there is little separation between self and other.  This means living beyond self-interest in a coherent world based upon interdependent wholeness rather than atomization and separation.  Empathy allows us to find that state of coherent connectedness.",empathy| connectedness| organization

Such mechanisms seem important to consider given the ubiquitous notion of bounded rationality in the literature.

Our empirical analysis first shows that high ownership concentration continues to be a common pattern in Latin American firms and firms-specific uncertainty has a positive and robust effect on ownership concentration. Additionally, firms where the largest shareholder is a strategic blockholder have more concentrated ownership than institutional investors; the largest shareholder tends to transfer its home-country governance systems and the uncertainty of formal institutions and individuals willingness to uncertainty matter for understanding the behavior of ownership concentration.",ownership| emerging markets| governance

By using Straussian grounded theory, this study found that these firms internationalize by conducting multiple concurrent experiments to find strategies to ensure the best fit with their current environment and to optimize their chances of meeting the goals of the firm or its managers. The findings of this research led to the development of a model of dynamic experimental internationalization.",internationalization| sme| transition economy

Bozen-Bolzano||2|Henrik Dellestrand|Uppsala U.||3|Oscar Martin Martin|Navarra Public U.||,,"This paper focuses on innovation development and transfer in multinational corporations. We use the evolutionary theory of the multinational company as our point of departure and confront it with the advantage paradox of such organizations. Evolutionary theory on the multinational corporation argues that the more innovations are developed, the more the subsidiary is transferring them internally within the organization. However, there are studies indicating that, due to the multiplicity of roles, a subsidiary increasingly engaged in development activities has difficulties engaging in transfer activities. This suggest that there is an advantage paradox connected to the evolutionary theory of the multinational corporation in that being competent at developing innovations does not necessarily lead to the fact that such innovations become transferred. In the paper we explore the effects of external embeddedness and subsidiary autonomy on subsidiary innovation development, and these three dimensions are subsequently linked to subsidiary innovation transfer intensity. Our analysis suggests that embeddedness and autonomy is enhancing subsidiary innovativeness but does not contribute to transfer intensity. However, we can confirm that the more a subsidiary is innovating, although being embedded and autonomous, the more it will engage in innovation transfer to sister subsidiaries. Consequently, this paper addresses core dimensions of evolutionary theory, finding support for its arguments, while we cannot find support for the advantage paradox of multinational corporations.",advantage paradox| autonomy| evolutionary theory
2233,,4|Spinning Gold: The Financial Returns to External Stakeholder Engagement,1|Witold Jerzy Henisz|U. of Pennsylvania||2|Sinziana Dorobantu|U. of Pennsylvania||3|Lite Nartey|U. of South Carolina||,,"In response to the growing societal challenge to multinational corporations strategic pursuit of short-term economic returns, these organizations increasingly seek to buttress the political and social support for their operations. Agency theorists and financial economists often claim that such actions to pursue corporate social responsibility are frequently efforts by senior managers seeking perquisites that necessarily impose costs upon shareholders. Others scholars agree that managers have discretion and arediverting shareholder returns but interpret these initiatives as altruistic and motivated by managers morality. A growing body of organizational economists, identify market conditions under which the diversion of shareholder returns to enhance social responsibility may, in fact, be optimal for a manager because they lead to a reduction in the cost of capital, improve employee productivity, increase consumer willingness to pay or reduce activists efforts to impose financial losses on the company. While acknowledging the existence of these causal mechanisms as well as managerial agency, we wish to call attention to an alternative and more direct driver of efforts by managers to improve external stakeholder perceptions of responsibility. We argue and present evidence that there exist cases in which such efforts, rather than diverting shareholder rents or moving the firm into a market niche with an alternative higher cost product, can be inputs into a more efficient production process. We undertake this analysis using panel data on 26 gold mines over the period 1993-2008. We code over 50,000 stakeholder events from media reports to develop an index of the degree of stakeholder cooperation or conflict for these mines anddemonstrate that this measure of political and social capital is an important component, together with characteristics of the mine and the price of gold, in calculating the financial market valuation of the 19 publicly traded parent firms.",strategic corporate social responsibility| stakeholder relations| political risk
