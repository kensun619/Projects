The 715 completed questionnaires were received from the first wave of data collection during July 2008 and the second wave was conducted again within the same organisations and 501 completed questionnaires were received during April 2009. Data were obtained through 52 organisations which were from three types of organisations within Thailand: public organisations (N=237,185), for-profit organisations (N=244,155), and not-for-profit organisations (N=234,161). Confirmatory factor analysis of all measures used in the study and hypothesized model were tested with structural equation modeling techniques. Results were strongly supportive.

Theoretical and empirical contributions suggest behavioural and attitudinal change will result from spiritual initiatives and organizational interventions. In this paper we explore the conceptual basis of this literature, drawing parallels with the culture change frameworks of the 1980s. These similarities underpin critical analyses that suggest spirituality at work is simply an extension of the colonization of the self that cultural interventions began, encroaching further into employee subjectivity. We challenge this by exploring the relationship between religion and culture drawing on anthropological and sociological frameworks, and argue that spiritually inspired change initiatives are distinctive in their promises to re-enchant work and organization. However this desire to reintroduce magic and mystery is a disenchanted re-enchantment, bounded by modernist rationality in which religion and spirituality remain equivalent or subordinate to other value systems. We conclude by noting the potential within spiritual and religious value systems to symbolise ideas that work within but against modernity, challenging or transcending the foundations of efficiency and calculability inherent to disenchanted organizational norms.",change| workplace spirituality| re-enchantment

Increasingly, these decisions concern interventions to prevent possible future undesirable health states.  The more uncertainty there is about a persons health status, the less expected benefit can be derived from even the most effective treatment.  We construct a taxonomy of five types of medical decision situations that encompass systematically different sources of uncertainty.  For each, we identify sources of uncertainty that should be considered when assessing the degree of belief that a person has, or will have, a condition. The five situations involve: 1) assessing the symptomatic patient; 2) assessing someone for an asymptomatic condition; 3) assessing someone for risk of a future condition; 4) simultaneously assessing multiple risks factors; and 5) considering a population-based prevention intervention (e.g., vaccination).       We show that if decision makers behave as though an asymptomatic condition or risk factor decision is structurally the same as the symptomatic or population-prevention decision, they may systematically overestimate the degree of belief that a person has, or will have, a condition and therefore systematically overestimate an interventions expected benefit.  We suggest this may explain the recent outcry in the USA over recent recommendations to reduce the frequency of breast and cervical cancer screenings.  We consider other implications of misunderstanding which decision situation a person faces.  This conceptual framework can aid medical professionals in thinking about and communicating about preventive assessment and intervention.",decision making| uncertainty| health

The empirical requirements for statistical discrimination entail clear and testable predictions. Only changes in empirical information will change statistical discriminators discriminatory behavior. If discriminatory behavior changes absent concordant changes in empirical information, those changes cannot be attributable to statistical discrimination. We show this type of theory-violating behavior for a phenomenon that has often been explained using statistical discrimination  racial disparities in patient care. Using data from a natural longitudinal audit study, we measure the disparities generated by the possible statistical-discriminators-to-be (i.e., medical students) and test for changes in the disparities they generate.  Where statistical discrimination would predict the opposite, we find a significant increase in the disparities generated by medical students between their first and second years. This large and rapid change in discriminatory behavior absent an empirical basis challenges the idea that statistical discrimination is primarily responsible for racial disparities in care. We discuss some alternative theories of racial disparities in care, and their ability to explain the large change we observe.",statistical discrimination| audit study| racial disparities

Lengnick-Hall|U. of Texas, San Antonio||",,"The knowledge-based view suggests that the foundation of an organizations strategy lies in its ability to generate, combine, recombine, and exploit knowledge.  Over the evolution of this stream of research, models have been designed around conceptualizing two distinct types of knowledge: tacit and explicit.  The focus is then on how to convert tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge. Tsoukas (2003) contested the idea of two types of knowledge. Reflecting Polanyis (1966) conceptualization of tacit and explicit as two interdependent dimensions of knowledge, he argues that all knowledge contains at least some tacit component.  We argue that strategic human resource management research would benefit from focusing on what sociologists call working knowledge or knowledge-in-practice rather than trying to distinguish tacit from explicit knowledge. We propose a typology of knowledge-in-practice that reflects varying dimensions of tacitness and learnability.  This reconceptualization makes several contributions to strategic human resource management research.  First, by clarifying the misunderstanding involving the two types of knowledge, we explain how this leads to inadequate theories and practice. Second, we create a refocused dimensional understanding of the knowledge construct based on Polanyis (1966) original work, which we believe effectively re-directs the focus from knowledge conversion, to the learnability and/or leverageability of knowledge involved in organizational practices. Third, we articulate the implications of this refocused dimensional understanding for strategic human resource management and management research in general.

However, in the presence of a serious performance downfall, declining demand, or external institutional pressures, workforce downsizing sometimes cannot be avoided. Therefore, the primary question for most companies is not whether or not to downsize but rather how to downsize successfully. So far, however, few empirical studies have focused on the internal characteristics of the downsizing process that influence the relationship between workforce downsizing and organizational performance. Our study addresses this gap by analyzing the effects of magnitude, timing, and realization of workforce downsizing on downsizing firms subsequent financial performance. Based on an analysis of the workforce downsizing actions by the largest European firms (Eurostoxx 50/Stoxx50) between 1996 to 2006, we find that the relationship between the magnitude of workforce downsizing and subsequent firm profitability is non-linear. Counter intuitively, however, the relationship is not inverted U-shaped but U-shaped. Further, findings suggest that this relationship is enhanced by the early timing of the downsizing and weakened by the use of divestitures for realizing the workforce reduction.",downsizing| firm profitability| timing

Similarly, interpersonal fairness should be especially pronounced among these individuals because they seek harmony in their relationships, thus treating employees with respect and consideration.

Procedural justice addresses instrumental concerns of personal agency; the desire for a safe, secure and predictable social environment; and social affiliation and belongingness needs associated with ones social standing and status within a group.  Workplace dehumanization is the experience of being objectified by the organization, denied personal subjectivity and made to feel like a tool or instrument for the organizations ends.  Workplace humanization, conversely, is the experience of having ones experiences, desires and feelings recognized by the organization and the ability to participate creatively and instrumentally in organizational processes.  Our dependent variables were three variants of social identity: pride identification with the organization; turnover intentions; and career well-being, a personal social identity that typically can only be realized through membership in a social group.

In addition, when a person self-labeled with a stigmatizing label, observers viewed the label as more positive, the self-labeler as possessing more powerful traits, and increased their desire for intergroup equality. This paper provides the first empirical proof that reappropriation may serve as an effective mechanism for the stigmatized to gain power.",power| identity| stigma

McCarter|Chapman U.||2|Bryan Bonner|U. of Utah||,,"The provision of public goods is a social dilemma that abounds at multiple organizational levels. Two reasons why individuals may not contribute toward public goods are because individuals may be uncertain about both the intentions of others and the value of the public good a priori to their contribution. This dual uncertainty begs cooperation mechanisms that address both sources of uncertainty simultaneously. Drawing from informational social influence and advice-taking literatures, the current paper investigates the effect of third-party advice on the estimated value of the public good on cooperation behavior. Experiment 1 finds that the valence of an advisors estimate (i.e., whether the value of the public good a priori to contribution is estimated to be a gain or loss) affects whether an individual contributes toward the public good, and this advice effect is mediated by the level of trust that individual has for fellow group members. Experiment 2 replicates the first studys results and further shows that when distribution valence of outcome estimates are mixed (i.e., one expert believes the value of the public good will be positive while the other negative) that individuals lose trust in the experts, and, as a result, trust in their group members declines. The decline in group member trust leads to an individual being less likely to contribute toward the public good compared to if no advice is provided at all. The theoretical and managerial implications of the current research are discussed.",social dilemma| public goods| advice taking

We also find that although people in a neutral emotional state are less receptive to bad advice than they are to good advice, people experiencing incidental anxiety are receptive to both good and bad advice (Experiment 3). Anxiety harms the ability of people to discriminate between biased and unbiased sources of advice when the bias is due to an advisors conflict of interest (Experiment 4). Finally, our results show that advisors recognize the power of making their advice recipients anxious, especially when they have a conflict of interest (Experiment 5).

Although prior studies have reported positive effects of EI on various individual outcomes, the underlying mechanism through which EI affects them has been assumed instead of being explicitly articulated and empirically tested. In this study, we identified three potential areas of emotion management (emotion expression, emotion recognition, and shaping counterpart emotion) that may be promoted by intrapersonal and interpersonal EI, and may mediate the effects of EI on interpersonal process and outcomes. We tested our hypotheses using data from 340 participants of a dyadic negotiation simulation. Our analysis indicates that EI predicts one aspect of emotion management (shaping counterpart emotion). Intrapersonal EI (but not interpersonal EI) increased counterpart positive emotion and decreased counterpart negative emotion during the negotiation simulation. Intrapersonal EI was also positively related to integrative behavior and negotiation satisfaction of the counterparts. Nevertheless, the overall relationship between EI and emotion management was weak. Moreover, negotiation process and outcomes were more strongly predicted by emotion management dimensions than by the two dimensions of EI.

In a fourth study, I conducted an interpersonal dyadic negotiation experiment with business school students and found that, as predicted, these effects replicated and extended to integrative outcomes and open behaviors. This research shows that there are both harmful and helpful effects of multiple identities on interpersonal problem solving depending on whether those identities are enhancing or conflicting: multiple identity conflict shuts down integrative thought and behavior and multiple identity enhancement opens us up to other people.",multiple identities| identity conflict| identity enhancement

We investigate this claim by comparing the entrepreneurial management practices and effects of these practices on profitability of a representative sample of 47 majority private equity backed, 23 minority private equity backed and 38 non-private equity backed buy-outs in the Netherlands. We develop a theoretical model distinguishing the simultaneous effect of financial leverage and private equity as a source of capital on the extent of entrepreneurial management post-buyout. We find that private equity backed buy-outs compared to non private equity backed buy-outs increase significantly more their entrepreneurial management practices, whereas the increased level of debt negatively affects entrepreneurial management. However, under very high levels of financial leverage private equity firms increase administrative management practices.

The focus is on whether, and to what extent, formal (independence) and informal (relational norms and trust) governance mechanisms influence the degree of internationalisation. Drawing on a sample of 101 Norwegian small and medium-sized family firms the results show that there is a positive and significant relationship between independence in board-management relations (formal governance mechanism) and the export intensity. Moreover, relational norms and trust (informal governance mechanisms) are positively and significantly related to the export intensity.

We find that if VCs are more impatient than Business Angels, the founders will prefer Business Angel to VC investment, provided that their technology is distant from the market. Conversely, they will prefer VC investment when a technology is closer to the market. If Business Angels are more impatient than VCs, the reverse occurs. Because Business Angels and VCs have different preferences regarding the signals they receive, the founders will send relatively more of the ""own investment"" signal, if they want to attract Business Angel investment, and more of the patent signal, if they want to attract VC investment.

Based on one of the largest confirmatory studies on business angels in German-speaking countries and, seen from an international perspective, this is the first large-scale study to capture ego-centric network data on business angels. In this study of 101 business angels who have made 1227 angel investments and capturing ego-network data on 579 individuals, we empirically investigate different drivers of the two deal flow dimensions, i.e. quantity and quality. As a theoretical framework the two opposing views of network openness and closure have been applied. Results show that the relational and structural embeddedness of business angels within their contact network have a significant effect on both deal flow dimensions. With regard to the relational embeddedness we found that strong ties positively affect both deal flow quantity and quality, thereby supporting the view of network closure. In contrast to that, our results show that concerning the structural embeddedness of a business angel open network structures are positively related to deal flow quality.

For this purpose, we use a longitudinal database comprising data from both questionnaires and financial accounts of 214 new ventures. Findings demonstrate that bootstrap strategies contribute more positively to venture development when ventures experience cash flow problems, while the use of particular bootstrap strategies may hamper venture development in ventures that do not experience cash flow problems. Moreover, while prior studies indicate that bootstrap strategies are particularly used in ventures with few growth ambitions, we demonstrate that bootstrap strategies are especially valuable in growth-oriented ventures.

Thus, the ability of an entrepreneur to effectively share information or pitch his or her venture is a potentially critical capability in the earliest stages of entrepreneurship.  Yet, there is little research that examines how entrepreneur pitches affect venture performance.  Content, like preparedness, has been shown to be more important than demonstrating passion (Chen, Yao & Kotha, 2009).  Affect in entrepreneurship is a growing area of research (e.g. Baron, 1999; Foo, Uy & Baron, 2009), but the role of affect for an entrepreneurs pitch remains unexplored.

Using a novel, unique dataset of videos of 185 entrepreneurial business pitches, we show that both content style and presentation style matter.  But unlike prior literature, we find several roles for affect that are important and not previously described.  Pitch content style with more affect of satisfaction but less of ambivalence and accomplishment is important as well as a presentation style with a positive and calm affect.

How Dependence on a Key Customer Affects Young Firm Survival and Growth,1|Helena Yli-Renko|U. of Southern California||2|Ramkumar Janakiraman|Texas A&M U.||,,"Extant research has indicated that young firms often become highly dependent on key customers, but the firm-level outcomes of such dependence are, as yet, poorly understood. In the marketing literature, outcomes of dependence have usually been studied on the relationship rather than firm level. In the entrepreneurship and management literatures, some work has noted the destructive potential of dependence, while others have focused on potential gains. The present study contributes to this discourse by examining how dependence on a key customer affects young firms in terms of (1) survival and (2) customer portfolio growth. Drawing primarily on resource dependence theoretical arguments, we propose that dependence on a key customer is a risky strategy that increases the chances that a young firm will fail. However, if a firm survives, the effects on customer portfolio growth are less clear-cuthere we contrast the negative resource dependence perspective with alternative positive efficiency, legitimacy, and learning arguments. Utilizing unique longitudinal data of young, technology-based firms operating in business-to-business markets, we build a switching-regression model in which we account for correlation between firm survival and customer portfolio growth. We find empirical support for a negative survival effect and, interestingly, a positive customer portfolio growth effect. Further, we find that the age of the firm at the time of forming the customer relationship will have a moderating effect: the younger a firm when it forms the key customer relationship, the more prominent are the effects of dependence on both survival and growth. Our findings make theoretical and empirical contributions to the literatures on dependence and customer relationships, and have important practical implications for entrepreneurs facing difficult trade-offs between focusing time and resources on a key customer versus on other customers.",entrepreneurship| resource dependence| key customer

We find that lockup length is positively related to executives equity ownership, and negatively related to CEO duality, founder status and to underwriter reputation.

In line with the empirical observation that the number of trade sales of young technology-based firms is increasing, an increasing number of scholars have investigated the determinants of a successful acquisition. However, most of the received literature analyzes acquisitions from the perspective of the acquirer and focuses on managerial actions in the period before and after acquisition that are likely to increase the acquisition success. In this paper, we take the perspective of the young technology-based firm and analyze to what extent managerial actions that are undertaken by these firms have an impact on its likelihood of being acquired and its eventual acquisition price. We use a neo-institutional perspective to position the managerial actions taken by those firms. Scholars in the neo-institutional perspective suggest that firms will take managerial actions to adjust to the expectations of the institutional environment in which they act. Doing so, they create different forms of legitimacy towards the different stakeholders in the ecosystem. In a sample of 296 UK young technology based firms, we find that signalling legitimacy is a determinant of success.",exit| technology acquisitions| legitimacy

Longitudinal data were collected from 104 entrepreneurship interns, and the results support my hypotheses.

We posit that adoption of this social media channel can be associated with effectual thinking, allowing entrepreneurs to reassess both what effects they can create with the means they have, and the very nature of those means.

Foremost among these challenges is the likely desire of social entrepreneurs to continue the social mission of the firm after its sale. We draw upon entrepreneurial effectuation theory and cases studies of several high profile social venture buyouts to develop propositions that focus on conditions under which the sale of a social enterprise enable the continuation of the social mission.

Additionally, our findings suggest that team heterogeneity and homophily may have differential impact on venture development at different stages. The effects of team homophily on venture formation are stronger when operational uncertainty and financial uncertainty are high.

We explore the meaning of opportunity value, and suggest a definition as it applies to entrepreneurship. We then investigate the relationship of opportunity value to opportunity pursuit.  This research utilizes both qualitative (semi-structured interviews) and quantitative (survey) methods to investigate the concept that entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs focus on different factors in determining the pros and cons of an opportunity.  Our results suggest that entrepreneurs consider more intangible, futuristic, and self-motivational items than non-entrepreneurs.

McMullen|Indiana U., Bloomington||",,"How do entrepreneurs anticipate others needs and determine whether those others will pay to have their needs alleviated, especially in new markets where customers do not yet exist?  In these instances, how do entrepreneurs determine who to target and how these targets will respond?  Attempts to answer these questions have been made by entrepreneurship theorists in economics and management, who have conceived of entrepreneurship as an act of opportunity recognition, innovation, learning, effectuation, or imagination.  In the rare instances in which demand uncertainty has been addressed, theorists have preferred to discuss opportunity in evolutionary fashion, emphasizing revealed preferences over the difficult subject of anticipated preferences.  Though useful in explaining entrepreneurial response to market demand once a product is introduced, this evolutionary realist approach is less helpful in explaining how entrepreneurs decide to initiate new product development for new markets.  The radical Austrian construct of heterogeneous imagination helps to explain how entrepreneurs generate ideas for new products, but it can also imply social chaos if there is nothing to constrain it.  Why is social order so prevalent if everyone is capable of constantly imagining new possibilities?  To address this theoretical dilemma, I introduce the social psychological construct of perspective taking to the entrepreneurial act of creating new products for new markets.",entrepreneurial agency| perspective taking| empathy

To date, the literature has mostly focused on the (erroneous) actions of the individual optimistic entrepreneur, yet, less attention was given to the effect this characteristic has on the interaction between entrepreneurial ventures and prospective resources providers. The following question motivates our study: How does optimism affect entrepreneur-investor interaction and what are the implications to ventures valuations? We conjecture that contingent-pay contracts (e.g., preferred shares) can deter charlatans but may be less effective in screening optimists, thus resulting in an optimism discount. We further conjecture that IPR regime may minimize the discount: an entrepreneur can attract higher valuation by disclosing her invention, but she would do so only when disclosure is not vulnerable to imitation (e.g., if patents are effective). Analyses of a sample of international venture capital investments between 1990 and 2006, using a novel measure of cross-country optimism levels, support our hypotheses. The results advance our understanding of entrepreneurial resource assembly, and particularly the nature of the interactions between entrepreneurs and resources providers.",entrepreneurship| venture capital| optimism

We propose a framework relating these concepts and empirically examine the impact of supply chain integration and organizational learning on the pace of corporate entrepreneurship using a bi-variate negative binomial model.  We found that supply chain integration and organizational learning each had a positive impact on the development of incremental and breakthrough innovations.  Specifically, we found that there were two distinctive business strategies among the entrepreneurial companies (small to larger sized firms) that we studied in the global automotive industry.   We interviewed managers and executives from multiple countries working in one of the biggest emerging markets, Brazil.  Some firms achieved higher levels of corporate entrepreneurship by focusing on their supply chain, while others did so by focusing more on organizational learning.

Employing regression analysis on a full sample of 1408 biotech firms and re-running the analysis on a sub-sample of 395 publicly listed firms, we find that depth depicts an inverted U-shape relationship with the likelihood of entrepreneurial success.

This method consists of a CEO bringing to the classroom a strategic issue that he/she is currently struggling with and having a team of students address the strategic challenge real-time together with the CEO. The technique builds on the organization development and change framework presented by Coghlan and Rashford (2006) which provides a blueprint for the student team to tackle the issue in class through a question-and-answer format. The ensuing dialogue and analysis becomes a living example of how the CEO thinks and makes decisions for the benefit of the whole class. We describe the live case intervention in detail, examine process considerations, and discuss its advantages and limitations. We argue that the resulting active participation in the CEOs thought process as he/she seeks to solve a significant problem, i.e., the opportunity to see the wheels turning and follow all streams of thought (including those with a dead end), is of the upmost importance in developing the tacit knowledge that is so valuable for senior executives.

While we are starting to learn the definition and components of an entrepreneurial mindset, we know little about how such mindset may be carved and developed. Using appreciative inquiry as a pedagogical tool, this paper embarks upon a journey to develop and carve entrepreneurial mindsets and discovers that an individuals mindset and its construction is, at least partially, dependent and connected to the larger social structure. On this basis, I discuss the challenges we face in managing the subtleties of carving an entrepreneurial mindset since the current educational practices for educating our students for entrepreneurship may not be adequate. Further, the paper provides some directions for entrepreneurship pedagogy.",appreciative inquiry| entrepreneurial mind set| pedagogy

Recently, scholars and practitioners have noted that adult development is an essential aspect of leader development (e.g. Day, Harrison, & Halpin, 2009; Avolio, 2005). However, how critical developmental transitions come about has not yet been thoroughly delineated. Drawing on adult learning theory, constructive developmental theory, and mentoring theory, we illustrate how developmental networks can serve as holding environments for leaders' development.  We  systematically consider how the composition of a focal leader's developmental network -- and in particular, the developmental positions of each mentor in the network and the adult learning approaches they model -- provide the necessary confirmation, contradiction and continuity that are essential for  movement to a new developmental stage. (Kegan, 1982). We offer four propositions regarding how developmental networks can serve as holding environments that foster greater authenticity and versatility in leadership.

We found that learning in an EMBA program is much more than a cognitive activity and that the needs that draw an executive into an EMBA program go well beyond the instrumental value of acquiring management knowledge and expertise. For EMBA students, learning is also emotional, personal, and spiritual; much of the important learning happens outside of the classroom, and that the most important benefits to the students are not informational, but transformational.

To increase methodological rigor, researchers need to consciously incorporate control variables that are known to influence criterion variables of interest so as to clearly partial out the influence of their predictor variables of interest.

This paper starts to address this by offering the concept of self-efficacy and its measurements as one way forward for both research and practice. We argue that self-efficacy provides a robust and legitimate construct that can be used for the design and the evaluation of entrepreneurship education in all its forms and guises which allows for a blend of approaches as it addresses the outcomes of the education independent of pedagogical method. This approach supports inter-programme comparison and thereby can also be usefully employed in the assessment of return on investment to institutions and society and ultimately the future resourcing of programmes.The relationship between self-efficacy and entrepreneurial intentions, opportunity recognition and career persistence is well established in the entrepreneurship literature. In addition to being a predictor of entrepreneurial behaviour, an individual's level of self-efficacy has repeatedly been shown to have a lasting legacy on venture growth and success. Therefore, fostering and enhancement of self-efficacy is increasingly recognised as a key object in education programmes, yet as an outcome measure, self-efficacy is seldom used. The reasons for this are primarily that there are different conceptualisations of self-efficacy and the challenges in measuring self-efficacy. In an effort to address these challenges this study attempts to define different self-efficacy constructs and their measure and presents findings based on pre- and post-test data gathered from 192 postgraduate participants.",self-efficacy| entrepreneurship education| outcome measures

The current research extends the findings of prior research and demonstrates that student performance on the MFT-B can be extremely valuable from other perspectives as well.  First, given that certain student characteristics seem to reliably predict performance, the test can be used strategically to identify key admissions criteria to business programs.  Second, benchmarking against other business programs can only be meaningful if certain student characteristics are identified and taken into accountsuch as the effect of student ACT scores, various GPAs and motivation.  And third, we examine the extent to which variance of ACT scores within a cohort (majors for example) impacts overall MFT-B results within that cohort.

We present a comprehensive model of helping, the Attribution-Prospect-Empathy-Severity (APES) model, and two studies that test it. Results from an experiment and a field study show that potential helpers have the same kinds of biases and attributional forces as other decision makers. The experimental results documented the expected effects of attributions, prospective framing, and empathy effects on helping, demonstrating that the APES model is applicable to both helping intentions and behaviors. A field study involving blood donations further demonstrated that people were more responsive to materials that stressed death-avoidance than those stressing life-saving. Thus, results from both laboratory and field experiments converged on the validity of the APES model.",decision-making| helping| field study

Drawing on previous research, we argue that reframing, defined as a switch in the frame of reference from which a problem is approached, constitutes an important process to consider in explaining creative benefits on the group level. Based on an analysis of the relevant literature on group composition and processes we identify the interplay of a groups diversity and the degree to which group members engage in perspective taking as crucial antecedents to both reframing and group level creativity. We hypothesize that perspective taking moderates the effect of functional role diversity on group creativity and that this moderation effect is mediated by reframing. Results of a group experiment manipulating both diversity and perspective taking in students groups (N=77) performing a creative task largely confirm our propositions. Perspective taking and diversity interact to predict group creativity. Furthermore, audio-video coded use of reframing in the group interaction partially mediates this moderated effect. Our results indicate the importance of perspective taking to realize the potential diverse groups hold. Accordingly, in order to increase our knowledge on how to manage diverse teams, further research of the factors conducive to perspective taking represents a promising avenue for future research.",diversity| teams| creativity

One area that is attracting attention is the role played by moods as a facilitator of creativity. In particular, there is on-going debate as to whether positive or negative moods states engender creativity. Though research using a between-person approach has offered important insights on the mood-creativity link, this approach fails to address our understanding of how creativity may vary along with transient states within individuals across time. The objective of research outlined in this reports therefore was to investigate the temporarily dynamic mechanism underlying mood-creativity link. We set out to investigate the concurrent and lagged effects of mood (valence and activation) and its interactive effect with transitory goal orientation on creative process engagement (CPE) using a within-person approach. Experience sampling data (N=764) collected from 30 participants engaged in creative tasks indicated that activating (deactivating) mood, independent of its valence, temporarily increased (decreased) CPE. Activating positive mood had a stronger concurrent effect on CPE than activating negative mood. Activating negative mood, on the other hand, had a longer-lasting effect on sustaining CPE across time. We also theorized and found specific goal orientation conditions under which activating moods were more or less effective in facilitating CPE.

The results indicate that although both intrinsic and extrinsic rewards are positive predictors of creative performance, the way they affect creativity is quite different. Intrinsic rewards exhibited a significant direct effect on creativity, and their positive effect was evident regardless of their level of importance as perceived by the employee. In contrast, extrinsic rewards exhibited only a significant indirect effect on employee creativity via commitment to creativity. Moreover, the effect of extrinsic rewards on creative performance was moderated by the importance of such rewards: extrinsic rewards promoted creativity of employees only when they regard extrinsic rewards as important.

Mitigated perceptions of the unethicality/greediness of over-reporting performance mediated the relationship between split spoils and increased over-reporting of performance (Study 3).

We argue that leaders identity work involves both conscious and unconscious processes, and focus on the latter by suggesting that those in highly coveted leadership roles may engage in projective identification to shape and sustain an identity befitting those roles. Projective identification is the unconscious projection of unwanted aspects of ones self into others, leading to the bolstering of a positive conscious self-view.  The recipients of a leaders projections may manage these by projecting such aspects back into the leader or into third parties, which may lead to the creation of a toxic culture.  We illustrate this process with examples from the Gucci family business.

Prior research on vision communication emphasizes how visions affect follower attitudes towards their leaders and organizations, their sense of meaning in their daily work, etc., but a theory that explains comprehensively how vision communication may lead to vision implementation is lacking. One of the reasons for this is that many theories emphasize the mediating effects of follower actual selves, perceptions of the current self. We emphasize follower possible selves, perceptions of the potential future self. We argue that the creation of follower possible selves is crucial for vision communication because possible selves link the self to motivation and subsequent self-regulation and may thus explain how vision communication relates to vision implementation.

Following this we offered two perspectives to explain how and why authentic leadership promotes negative feedback-seeking behaviour. We suggested, from a cognitive perspective, that such leadership can influence the followers beliefs concerning the perceived value and cost of feedback seeking and in turn increase the likelihood of employees proactively engaging in such behaviour. We further argued that emotions also play a significant role in this process. We proposed that feedback-seeking behaviour could also be promoted by authentic leaders through a mechanism of cultivating the followers positive emotions. We concluded by drawing out the theoretical contributions as well as the practical implications from this dual-perspective model, alongside a discussion of the promising directions for future research.",authentic leadership| feedback seeking

Recent research based on Construal Level Theory has shown that higher social distance leads to more severe evaluations of unethical behavior in moral dilemmas. From a higher social distance perspective, people tend to focus more on abstract moral principles than on concrete circumstantial information regarding unethical conduct. Recently, there has been increased interest in investigating the effects of social distance and proximity on moral judgment in applied business contexts (e.g., human resource management). We extend this body of research by investigating social distance effects on ethical leadership evaluations and its consequences for leader-member exchange (LMX). Participants read a scenario describing a moral situation in which a leader, who was presented in either high or low social distance, behaves unethically towards an employee. Our results show that in the high social distance condition participants judged leaders more harshly (i.e., they gave lower ethical leadership ratings) than in the low social distance condition. Thus, social distance moderates the extent to which leaders are perceived as ethical leaders after moral transgression. Moreover, as expected, ethical leadership ratings had a positive influence on LMX. We discuss research and managerial implications of our findings.",ethical leadership| social distance| moral judgment

Consistent with the hypothesized relationships, results indicate that personal mastery traits were related to negative ethical judgments of WPD and positive ethical judgments of OCBs.  Competitive excellence traits were generally associated with positive contractualism judgments of WPD and negative contractualism judgments of OCBs.  Motivation related to anxiety was largely unrelated to WPD or OCBs.

Our findings, based on assessments of 70 leaders that included data from over 500 of their subordinates, colleagues, and supervisors, show that SCL is associated with heightened norms of cooperation and reduced norms of enforcement in formal groups.  Norms of cooperation, in turn, were associated with group density of instrumental ties.  Our findings also demonstrate that when groups are characterized by more face-to-face work arrangements, group density of instrumental ties is associated with group performance.

Study 2 helped establish causality by manipulating the leaders demeanor through the use of a research confederate; it also tested the mediating effects of perceived leader competence and threat.  We found that, in participative decision making, the effect of the leaders demeanor on follower voice was mediated by perceived leader competence.

The results of our analyses of 262 individuals from 67 work teams supported this reasoning, showing that relatively task dependent team members reported more negative affective reactions when their task interdependence with other members was low and more positive affective reactions when their task interdependence was high. The findings from this study contribute to research on power by showing the affective correlates of an under-scrutinized structural basis of power in teams.

In general, proactivity has been addressed as a solitary action that one undertakes on ones own in order to further ones own agenda or to improve the functioning of the organization. However, proactivity can also be conceptualized as a social process involving interacting with others across multiple stages to make change. In this manuscript, we use qualitative data from a call center to demonstrate that proactivity is often a social affair. An employees decision to act proactively is contingent upon a number of social factors including the perceived impact of the action on others as well as the perceived response of the others impacted. Further, many of the ways in which people act proactively involve engaging other people in the issue. Through our detailed investigation into the social processes underlying proactivity, we add a complementary perspective to proactive models that focus on individual and contextual variables and models that focus on proactivity as a singular action.",proactive behaviors| social influence| qualitative

This study extended the Demand-Control model of stress to explore the interactive effects of distance and autonomy, two key considerations in flexible work design, on exhaustion. Additionally, it was posited that emotional stability determines how distance and autonomy are perceived and received by employees, thus changing the form of their interactive effects. In a sample of 205 employees from 4 public and private organizations, all predictions were supported. Specifically, high autonomy attenuated the detrimental effect of distance on distance, whereas low to moderate autonomy exacerbated it. This relationship also emerged among high-emotional stability employees, but among low-emotional stability employees, the level of autonomy did not affect the distance-exhaustion relationship. This suggests that emotional stability may determine the efficacy of control factors in work design. Therefore this study may contribute to theory by testing the Demand-Control model in the context of flexible work design and by extending it to explicitly include personality. Specifically, the model may not hold true for all employees, depending on their personality.

College London||,,"In a longitudinal study of players in the National Hockey League over 10 seasons, we find that players perform better when they work on teams with members who are moderately similar to themselves in terms of performance. This result is surprising given that those who perform much better than us have much more to teach us. We explain this finding by drawing on the perspective of goals as reference points that influence motivation to learn from others. Specifically, we argue that when others are relatively similar to ourselves, we believe that we will be able to learn their knowledge or skills, and that doing so is valuable, and therefore are more motivated to do so. In contrast, when others are much worse than us, their knowledge may not be viewed as worth learning, and when they are much better than us, their knowledge may be too difficult to learn. This research contributes to our understanding of the motivational processes that influence when team members implicitly learn from one another.",teams| learning| motivation

In the current research we investigated this issue and found that, while suspending group debate causes groups to generate a higher of number of ideas, a higher number of highly novel ideas, and more diverse ideas, only the number of highly novel ideas and the diversity of ideas that groups generate predict the quality of final group plans.

In line with Common Ingroup Identity and Social Identity Complexity models, we argue that whilst strong identification with an inclusive organisational unit may attenuate sub-group conflict, a dominant pattern of identification that favors either a subunit or individual target is likely to be detrimental to inter-group functioning. Focusing on the identification of navy personnel in a longitudinal design, we find compelling evidence of 3 way interactions in which patterns of identification with career, team and ship foci significantly affect the level of conflict reported.  Consistent with predictions, we find that personnel who strongly identify with subgroup and personal work targets in the absence of attachments to other workplace foci report heightened conflict when working with members of other teams.  We suggest that these findings have critical implications for cross-team collaborative outcomes within the workplace.",conflict| inter-team| identification

The key finding was that process interventions had immediate effects on critical group processes, but did not significantly improve decision quality during the task in which the intervention was received.  Surprisingly, post-intervention processes continued to improve and resulted in improved decisions in a subsequent task.  This lagged effect was mediated by the degree to which groups aggregated unique information and avoided advocating for individual members preferences.  Hypotheses regarding the effects of the timing and type of intervention were not supported.  However, directive interventions were more effective than participative interventions at reducing the amount group members advocated for their own preferences.

Provocateurs help generate and critically assess novel ideas, aiding team decision-making. Harmonizers maintain social relationships within the team and promote team cohesiveness. We develop a theoretical model in which team composition - the presence of provocateurs and harmonizers, along with team cognitive ability - influences the amounts of cognitive and affective conflict experienced by the team. Team composition also moderates the effects of both types of conflict on team performance. We test our hypotheses with a sample of 271 members of 77 teams that participated in a complex management simulation.

This paper develops and tests a theory to explain how even small differences in members status perceptionsdifferences that may not be apparent to the members themselvescan diminish coordination, generate task conflict, and weaken performance.  Survey data from a longitudinal field study of 89 consulting and accounting teams from a Big Four firm allows us to examine how teams experience status disagreement over time. Independent, third-party performance data for each team demonstrates how coordination and conflict ultimately affect performance with clients.

Transitions between types are related to stages of team development or changes in team structure. Types with shared psychological contract contents have a positive impact on team performance.

In an attempt to increase our understanding of employee silence, a model of employee silence and voice is presented and three related studies are conducted.  The proposed model illustrates proximal and component factors of employee silence and voice and their proposed relationships.  This model adapts elements of  psychological field theory (Lewin, 1936, 1943) to explain different aspects of the manifestation of employee silence and voice at different levels of abstraction.  The three studies which follow are designed to: (a) investigate the nature and dimensionality of the motives for employee silence and voice, (b) develop survey measures of employee silence- and voice-motives based on these dimensions, and (c) administer these new measures to a different group of subjects to further assess their validity.  The results indicate: (a) employees may simultaneously experience motives for speaking up and for remaining silent; (b) the motives for silence are distinct from simply an absence or opposite of motives for voice; (c) the motives for silence and the motives for voice logically group into distinct dimensions; and (d) the strength of the motives for silence and the motives for voice can be reliably measured.",silence| voice| communication

Two hundred and twenty-four employed teenagers (M age = 17.54 years, 60% female) completed two surveys one month apart.

The research model was derived from prior theoretical and empirical studies that emphasise the positive outcomes of engagement. Quantitative survey data were gathered from 2194 employees (mean age = 41.34) representing two organizations. Analysis using structural equation modeling showed that meaningfulness, perceived job fit, extrinsic job satisfaction, and perceived trust in line managers were critical to engagement. A similar set of factors were associated with wellbeing and performance. In general, the data supported our research model and confirmed that managerial attention to job fit, the development of trustworthy relationships with line managers and appropriate rewards are likely to lead to engaged effort from employees.However, contrary to expectation, meaningfulness was associated negatively with performance. Post hoc analysis examined the impact of job type and managerial responsibility on this relationship. Data showed that the difference was particularly significant for non-managers, yet there was no relationship between meaningfulness and performance for employees in skilled trades. The overall results and the dual role of meaningfulness are discussed within a framework of job enrichment, perceived job fit, and individual differences in the need for meaningful work.

This work aims to gather together the scattered literature on meaningful work and proposes a novel way to define it as work that offers the worker positive significance in life thus contributing to the fulfillment of the basic human need for meaningfulness. This inherent need for meaningfulness is proposed to consist of four individual elements: the need for purpose, for values, for efficacy and for self-worth. Work is meaningful when it is able to fulfill one or many of these needs but the needs individual workers attempt to fulfill through their work are dependent on their larger life. The individuals experience of meaningful work is understood to be achieved through a process of meaningfulness-making in which the job characteristics, the individual, the organization and the wider society interact in a dynamic and ongoing fashion. Thus meaningful work is ultimately a match between the individuals values and the characteristics of the work, the interpretation of both of these being influenced by the organization and the wider society.",meaningful work| meaning in life| meaningfulness-making

In as much as dyads are interdependent, we propose that four types of resilience can emerge within dyadic work relationships: 1) dyadic deterioration (lower interpersonal forgiveness and lower relational exchange); 2) dyadic buoyancy (higher interpersonal forgiveness and lower relational exchange); 3) dyadic hubris (lower interpersonal forgiveness and higher relational exchange); and 4) dyadic thriving (higher interpersonal forgiveness and higher relational exchange).

Harmonious spirit was originated from Yijing, the most important Confucian scripture written 3,000 years ago.

More specifically, the mechanism of the eight trigrams can formulate the eight-factor model comprehensively.  The results not only manifest how harmonious spirit penetrates into Chinese organizations, but also indicate that Chinese employees have been affected by this cultural value orientation significantly.  In addition to giving multinational managers a better understanding on Chinese organizational behaviour, our findings illustrate that Chinese cultural values have been integrated into and directly influences organizational practices.

I discuss four decisive objections against the reductive account. And I argue that some character strengths, such as the virtue of gratitude and the virtue of self-respect, do not conform to the reductive approach because such virtues cannot be reduced to dispositions to follow certain moral principles: they are matters of attitude, desire, and belief, rather than matters of duties and conduct.

Existing empirical studies tend to suggest that public managers are less likely to exhibit positive work attitudes as compared to their private sector peers.  However, literature about the comparison of work attitudes between public and nonprofit managers is scant.  The current study addresses this topic.  By using the NASP-III survey data, the author found that nonprofit managers are more likely than public managers to show positive work attitudes.  This attitudinal difference, based on the results of mediation tests, originates from two important reasons.  First, higher levels of rule constraints (i.e. red tape and personnel flexibility) in the public sector undermine managers!| work attitudes.  Second, individuals attracted to work in the public sector have stronger extrinsic motivation, stronger amotivation, and weaker intrinsic motivation.

I use rare full relational network data of Danish mayors to examine the expectations. In a study of policy isomorphism in Danish municipalities (operationalized as expenditure policy similarity), I investigate whether municipalities with mayors who are more structurally embedded in the network (operationalized as degree centrality) exhibit higher levels of policy isomorphism. The analysis shows that mayor network centrality is associated with policy isomorphism but only when mayors have more political power or come from a smaller municipality with a smaller bureaucracy. The study contributes to public management literature by showing how individual level networks of political executives constrain organizational decision making and action in ways moderated by public sector characteristics.",social network| isomorphism| political executives

To date, research has neglected investigation of the potential moderating effect of organizational identification in the work stressor-employee adjustment relationship.

It was expected, further, that more proximal, lower order identifications would be more prevalent and potent as buffers of stressors on strain. Predictions were tested with an employee sample from five organizations (N = 267). Hierarchical moderated multiple regression analyses revealed some support for the stress-buffering effects of identification in the prediction of job satisfaction and organizational commitment, particularly for more proximal (i.e., work unit) identification.

Using a case study of Pennsylvania State University's responses to an identity threat, we argue that the social processes of identity construction demonstrate four main characteristics (intentional, temporal, relational, and external). That is, identity construction is firstly intentional and purposeful in that the goals of organizational leaders and members direct the nature of their identity claims and perceptions.  Identity construction process is temporal in that identity claims and perceptions are rooted in the events of a specific time period that is related to, yet independent from, earlier organizational identity conceptions.  Identity construction is also relational in that an organization's relationship with its stakeholders, environment, and peer organizations contributes to how its identity is constructed. Lastly, identity construction is external in that the results of the identity construction process are always communicated externally and leaders and members have an external audience in mind throughout the process.

This study takes an inductive approach, with in-depth interviews with 64 expatriates in Singapore and China. The findings suggest that expatriates!- developmental networks are shaped by multiple individual, dyadic, and contextual factors. And whether the developmental networks yield desired outcomes depends upon the person-network fit (i.e., the perceived match between what the expatriates need in terms of the career, psychosocial, and cross-cultural transition support and what they actually get out of their developmental networks). A conceptual model about expatriates!- developmental networks is developed through the person-network fit perspective.",developmental network| expatriates| person-network fit

Managing emotions for a wage can encompass several strategies, including: surface acting, deep acting and the expression of genuine felt emotions.  Research on the meaning of work has also received increased attention recently.  In complying with emotional demands inherent in an occupation, the degree a person perceives the job as meaningful, and has a calling orientation, may increase emotional labor, particularly deep acting and genuine felt emotions.  The present study examined if having a calling orientation for work, or perceiving work as significant and rewarding, strengthened the relationship between customer emotional demands and emotional labor.  Using two measures of customer emotional demands (O*NET database index and self-report), the present study found that emotional demands were positively related to self-reported emotional labor strategies.  In addition, the calling orientation significantly moderated the relationship between non-self report and self-report emotional demands, and emotional labor strategies.",emotions| meaning| calling

Most researchers have addressed this question exploring the objective circumstances that allow actors to adopt new practices even when their intentions, actions, and rationality are conditioned by institutional scripts.  In contrast, this paper asks why actors exposed to similar objective circumstances engage in different forms of institutional work.  It argues that actors decide to preserve, change, or erode institutional scripts because of tensions engendered as they incarnate these scripts in their practice.  It contributes to the emergent inhabited view on institutions with a conceptualization of why actors engage in institutional work that articulates that how people do things together (instead of simply what they do) crucially frames their decision making.  The conceptualization offered abandons false dualities of institutional actors as either dopes or heroic entrepreneurs for actors as people.  From this perspective, actors decision making is framed by interests that do not necessarily precede but can also emerge with their acting, and it is modulated by relational dynamics (trust, reputation, social distance, and status competition) generated through a history of social interactions.",institutional agency| institutional change| institutional work

In an empirical examination of the downstream laser printer industry and upstream laser engine industry, we first replicate empirical results commonly found in the organizational ecology literature. We then show that an increase in the density of upstream suppliers reduces mortality rates for downstream firms.

In contrast, the framework proposed here does not posit, ex ante, the existence of such distinct stages. Rather, it assumes that the nature of the relations between the key constructs used in the theory does not change over time. Despite this simplification, the model can generate the various patterns of age-dependence identified in empirical analyses. In that sense, we believe that the approach proposed here provides an alternate theoretical integration of some of the existing theories of age dependence.

Critics have referred to the salaries paid to managers as pay without performance, while defenders have countered that the large salaries can be explained by a war for talents. This research tests whether a war for talent provides an explanation for the rise in management compensation. According to defenders of the high salaries, resting on the efficient labor market view, the rise in executive compensation is the product of a shift toward transferable managerial skills, particularly in large firms, and this trend contributes to firm performance. Relying on an internationalized and deregulated managerial labor market, i.e. the Swiss banking sector, the empirical findings confirm that a shift toward transferable managerial skills in large firms is indeed an explanation for the rise in management compensation. However, the shift towards transferable managerial skills in large firms does not improve firm performance, giving no supporting evidence for a war for talent.",efficient labor market view| executive compensation| transferable skills

Second, a CEO dismissal reduces the chances of the incumbent CFO being promoted into the vacant CEO position, which is also an indicator for the disadvantages of close relationship ties with the CEO.

Our theory suggests why (1) there may be a systematic tendency for analysts to underestimate the extent to which other analysts share their reservations about stock repurchase plans (i.e., reservations about whether such plans reflect well on the performance prospects of adopting firms), such that (2) analysts mimic others and issue more positive earnings forecasts and stock recommendations in response to the adoption of repurchase plans despite having private reservations about whether the plans reflect well on adopting firms. We also contend that analysts are less likely to underestimate the extent to which others share their reservations about repurchase plans to the extent that they have frequent communication ties to other analysts. We test our specific hypotheses with a unique dataset that includes original survey data from a large sample of security analysts and found strong support for our theory. While prior neo-institutional research on mimetic isomorphism has primarily adopted a cognitive perspective in which actors imitate others based on their understandings of a particular policy or practice (i.e., they either take the value of the policy for granted or infer the value of the policy from others prior decisions), this study begins to develop a more social psychological perspective on imitation wherein actors imitate others based on their biased perceptions of others beliefs about the policy. Our theory and findings also extend perspectives on institutional persistence by explaining why constituents may continue to publicly endorse a policy despite having private reservations about the policys efficiency benefits. In particular, we suggest that constituents may continue to respond positively to the adoption of a policy not because they assume or take-for-granted the benefits of the policy, but because they overestimate the extent to which other constituents hold this assumption. Accordingly, this study suggests a novel social psychological mechanism by which the institutional value of organizational policies is maintained.",neo-institutional theory| corporate governance| institutionalization

Information leadership is an important feature of information circulation in financial markets that materially influences how value is determined.  Our analysis of analysts earnings forecasts for publicly traded US firms from 1994 to 2000 provides evidence of both the role of the analysts coverage network and its interaction with the attributes of analysts and their brokerage firms.  A counter-intuitive finding is that analysts possessing favourable personal and brokerage firm attributes assert greater information leadership on stocks occupying constrained network positions.

We thus argue that decoupling in organizational change should be analyzed in functional terms of existing mechanisms in addition to their sociopolitical aspects, while newly adopted mechanisms such as outside directors could also contribute to shareholders!- wealth with disciplining roles.",symbolic management| corporate governance| decoupling

This paper also examines how directors response to the Enron scandals and their regulatory aftermath, led to some boards adopting a new model of practice  one that directors deemed more efficacious and possessing legitimacy, bringing together the old and the new institutionalism in institutional change processes.  Legitimacy was drawn from guidance from a professional association for directors (National Association of Corporate Directors) that outlined how boards could become a strategic asset to the firm that was consistent with a stewardship model of governance that saw boards collaborative with management.  It is also argued that following the Enron scandal, directors searched for a model of practice that would be more robust such that their fears of liability would be reduced.  In searching for and adopting a new model of practice, it is also argued that effective adoption requires coupling to the technical core (enacted), as opposed to merely symbolic adoption.   This research studies directors and senior management of public firms of the TSX Composite by way of survey methods. The findings provide support that the board is evolving in Canada to a new collaborative model and that the model of practice appears to be enacted (coupled) as opposed to symbolic (decoupled).  Further, the results did not find that collaborative boards are impaired in their monitoring function and support is found that monitoring is actually enhanced.",corporate governance| institutional theory| institutional change

Having an independent-dominated board, and particularly a compensation committee dominated by non-executives, is proffered as a means both to avoid board capture and to facilitate more diligent monitoring and greater pay-performance sensitivity in executive contracts. On the basis of Australian and other evidence, however, we suggest that this shared faith in board structural independence as a remedy for the agency problem and pay-performance decoupling is misplaced. Instead, we propose a new departure for theory, research and policy development in this area; one that goes beyond the bounds of both economic rationality and structural determinism and explores the social-cognitive aspects of board advice-seeking, sense-making and decision-making in this domain.",executive compensation| company boards| director independence

A status hierarchy induces firms to restrict themselves to mutually-exclusive quality levels rather than try to invade nearby quality levels. This kind of self-enforced, mutually-recognized differentiation can substantially increase a markets capacity to support overlapping competitors. I examine this in the context of the electrically-erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM) market from 1977 to 2001. I find that status differentiation has a positive effect on a firms product line size.

It explores the role of spatial distribution of principals (firms) and mediating agents (intellectual property litigation firms) in facilitating and sustaining the conflictual relationships. Spatial propinquity is hypothesized to determine the nature of social relationships between the principals and the mediating agents employees, subsequently affecting the mediating agents involvement in identification of opportunities for conflictual interactions by the principal. Propinquity is also predicted to decrease principals communication and transportation costs while maintaining a professional relationship with the mediating agent, hence proving a more positive economic outlook of entering into and sustaining conflictual ties. The context of this study is the patterns of spatial distribution of 405 U.S. firms in biotechnology and pharmaceuticals (the principals) and 57 leading intellectual property litigation firms (the mediating agents). It relates these patterns to the involvement in patent infringement disputes by the biopharmaceutical firms in 1998-2006. The study additionally utilizes evidence from thirty-two semi-structured interviews with business executives, in-house legal counsel, patent attorneys, and litigators.

Organizations meeting their competitors simultaneously in multiple markets enjoy better survival chances, higher growth rates, and more stable market shares. These outcomes are typically interpreted as results of mutual forbearance between multipoint competitors. However, the presence of actual network ties between multipoint competitors is never examined directly. Using original fieldwork and data that we have collected on an interorganizational network of patient transfer relations within a regional community of hospitals, we report and interpret  estimates of Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGM) for social networks that specify the probability of observing network ties between organizations as a function of the degree of their multipoint contact. We find that hospitals competing for patients across multiple geographical segments of the market (spatial multipoint competitors) are significantly more likely to collaborate. We show that this conclusion is robust to alternative explanations for the formation of network ties based on organizational size differentials, resource complementarities, and capacity constraints. Finally, we show that interorganizational networks between spatial multipoint competitors are characterized by significant tendencies toward clustering and toward an overall core-periphery structure. These tendencies arise as consequences of multiple mechanisms of triadic closure operating simultaneously. We conclude that the effects of competition on the structure of interorganizational fields depends on how markets as relational settings are connected by cross-cutting network ties between competitors.",multipoint competition| interorganizational networks| exponential random graph models

Our goal is to clarify what drives the emergence of embedded ties in clusters.  Building on the work of Uzzi (1996, 1997), we clarify and extend the theoretical framework on the antecedents of embedded ties, proposing different mechanisms of embedded ties creation at the dyadic and triadic level.  Specifically, we expect that both social and economic drivers contribute to the emergence of embedded ties, that social ties have a stronger impact than economic ones in this process, and that the effect of third party referrals on embedded ties is contingent upon the type of network under examination.  Building on recent methodological advances in the analysis of networks evolution, we use longitudinal network data on a geographic cluster located in Northern Italy to test our hypotheses about embedded ties creation and change.  Results support our hypotheses, providing additional insight on the relative importance of economic and social ties in the emergence of embedded ties and shedding light on the type of local structures determining the evolution of networks.",embedded ties| network evolution| geographic clusters

However, when the performance of an organization in a brokerage position deviates from its aspiration level, it is more likely to form status-homophilous ties.

Based on the CCO perspective, terrorist organizations can be conceptualized as essentially consisting of communicative events which necessitate to become interconnected over time.

But is this discount due to what a candidate has done or how they did it? I propose that a candidates past historic sequence of category membership acts as a cue to potential evaluators. Candidates who have cumulatively moved between categories separated by stronger boundaries (more cognitively distant) will be disadvantaged. This is because when audiences attempt to apply a narrative to a candidate, those with past job sequences that span more cognitively distant categories will be perceived as a dilettante. Those with more regimented paths, who move between more cognitively proximate jobs, will be inferred as being more deliberate and conscientious. Job sequences traversing greater distance lead a candidate to look erratic. I find support for this theory in an online market for freelancing services by showing that those freelancers who have sequences of employment between more cognitively distant job categories are less likely to garner subsequent work. This holds net of alternative explanations, such as inherent skill, breadth, or relatedness of past experiences. I also show support for this by matching bidders with identical work backgrounds, who only vary in the order in which they accumulated their experiences. Even among this conservative dataset, I demonstrate that bidders who have moved between more distant job categories are chosen less often.",markets| categories| job sequences

Here, I suggest this depends on the type of audience that is evaluating the organization. Audiences that have little influence over organizations use classification systems as maps to navigate an organizational world, and thus are put off by unclear categorical affiliations. Other audiences, which have a voice in shaping organizations and which seek novelty, are motivated to understand those that do not easily fit into a category structure. For audiences without voice, ambiguous categories make organizations unclear and less appealing. For audiences with influence that prize novelty, this same ambiguity is flexible and therefore more appealing. I test these ideas in the context of the software industry for audiences of consumers as opposed to venture capitalists. As predicted, organizations in ambiguous categories are less appealing to consumers, but more appealing to venture capitalists. Differences between category-level and organization-level measures of ambiguity, and implications for the emergence of category structures are discussed.",categories| venture capital| ambiguity

In this paper, I propose a new model for better understanding when conformity and non-conformity have favorable effects on certain economic outcomes. Analyzing the association between organizational conformity, returns, and capital flows in the context of the hedge fund industry, I find that investors allocate capital more readily into non-conforming hedge funds following periods of short-term positive performance. Non-conforming funds are also less severely penalized for recent poor performance. Both effects persist despite strong steady-state normative pressures towards conformity. Deciphering this outcome and exploring what it means for theories relating to organizational identity, legitimacy, and isomorphism in markets, are the aims of this paper.

Greater diffusion of the form among mass audience, however, does not mediate the critical influence. These findings contribute to the emergent theory of social categorization in organizational fields by offering a framework that captures the continuous enactment of valuation systems, valuation orders and role structures within audience and the interactions among them.

With a view to taking an integrated approach, we conceptualize organizational architecture as a complex system of both formal and informal forces, and operationalize in network terms the informal network and three formal networks  formal hierarchy, sequential, and reciprocal workflows.  We theorize that performance is positively related to consistency between the formal hierarchy and the informal network, and the sequential and informal networks, but related in an inverted U-shaped form to inconsistency between the reciprocal workflow and the informal networks.

Spanning multiple categories is thought to be detrimental because it makes an actors identity unclear and dilutes their focus. Still, straddling categories is an important driver of innovation and has implications for the emergence, evolution, and redirection of institutional fields. Despite this, understandings about the mechanisms which affect category spanning are limited. Building on research which shows the institutional shaping of identities and innovation, I argue that evolving relationships amongst categories facilitate spanning by linking particular categories together in meaningful ways. Moreover, I argue that the relational structuring of categories is shaped endogenously by prominent actors in ways that condition the effects of alternate explanations based on category richness, networks, and social influence.

Using historical analysis of archival data, and oral histories supplemented by interviews with DBF founders, we construct the lash up process that melded elements from three separate domains  academic science, commercial healthcare, and new-venture finance  into an interactively stable pattern. Our findings modify received wisdom on organizational genesis in two important ways. First, although we accept social novelty as the reassembly of pre-existing elements, we argue that it matters greatly whether such reassembly results from recombination (the rearrangement of recognizable elements within an institutional domain) or transposition (the introduction and incorporation of foreign elements from previously separate institutional domains). Second, our analysis points to an unexplored paradox in organization theory: that commercial viability and institutional influence may in some cases be inversely correlated. Among the pioneering DBFs were two distinct variants: a handful of businesses founded through recombinatory mechanisms, and a group of firms launched by trespassers, scientists who naively transposed academic practices and values into a commercial setting. Perhaps predictably, the former proved a more robust business model.

Our findings contribute to the literature on fads and fashions by showing that fads have their origins in the cultural dissemination of exaggerated expectations and the associated affective responses.

To analyze the impact of parenting events on advertising agency survival, we use the life history data of all advertising agencies and executives that operated in the New York City area from 1924 to 1996.  The findings show that parenting events have a negative impact on the competitive viability of the parent firms. Parents are more likely to fail than are their progeny spin-offs, an effect that increases with the number of executives departing. We go beyond previous genealogical research by investigating the functional backgrounds of high-level members of the organization as a proxy for their individual knowledge.  We find that parent firm survival is hurt most by the departure of chief executives and back office executives and that progenies benefit from being founded by a chief executive. These effects are asymmetric and that neither functional background nor founding team size has an effect on the survival chances of progeny firms.  Overall, these findings support the view that the critical capabilities within professional service organizations do indeed reside substantively at the individual level, but that all knowledge of the organization cannot be decomposed to the knowledge of individuals.",capabilities| knowledge

Past research has largely focused on the imminent characteristics of past employer to predict the probability of entrepreneurial transition; in con!trast, I suggest that conditions present at the incipient stage of an individuals career, which I term career imprints, leave an indelible mark that continues to affect ones decisions and behaviors today. Specifically, I argue that an exposure to risk, discretion and entrepreneurial coworkers, early in ones career, increases the propensity of external venture formation. Findings show that career imprints have an effect on the future transition to entrepreneurial activity; an early-career exposure to risk increases the probability that employees deploy their efforts outside the parent firm. Moreover, organizational members whose early-career coworkers founded new ventures outside are more likely to transition to entrepreneurship in the future. The imprinting effect is partially mitigated by a negative feedback (i.e., an actors low performance), which suggests that adaptive learning is an integral part of the imprinting mechanism. Together, findings in the present study provide evidence that formative environments factor into an actors decision-making model and that they should be considered to enrich the understanding of entrepreneurial transition.",imprinting| entrepreneurship| new organizations

By examining the pathways by which genealogy is transmitted through the action of individuals to new firms, and combining that with an empirical analysis of over 250 new firms in the computer game industry, this paper seeks to shed additional light on the linkage between genealogy and new venture performance.

We address this research gap through field research on founders within a Silicon Valley high-technology business incubator.  We identify role-based and identity-based tensions within the community as two tensions that stem from balancing the norms of autonomy with the need for help in obtaining resources, and we describe three community strategies that mitigate against such tensions: engagement in problem-focused mentoring, the facilitation of peer exchanges, and the selective linking of affiliation.

When creativity is a major source of an organization's competitive advantage, managers need to establish a work environment that fosters creativity. This paper analyzes how the creativity dependency of an organization impacts managers' choices of organizational control mechanisms. Building on theory from creativity research and research on organizational control mechanisms, we propose a model that links the creativity dependency of an organization with two main influencing factors of organizational control mechanisms: high importance of intrisic motivation and low programmability of tasks, that is, a lack of knowledge about the relationship between employee behavior and the achieved outcomes. Using survey data from 458 firms in the German-speaking countries, we test our theoretical model and provide evidence on how the perceived creativity dependency of organizations influences the choice of organizational control mechanisms.",creativity| organizational control mechanisms

Drawing on relational theories, we then consider when that relationship inertia can be overcome.  We test our hypotheses using detailed records from two major law firm acquisitions.  The records allow us to observe law firm partners forming relationships by sharing clients with one another -- a key driver of integration among law firm partners.  We show how the prior workplace networks of partners predict the amount and type of sharing they engage in during the post-acquisition period.

We integrate traditional network theories with cognitive psychology, suggesting that the activation of social networks is a pre-condition to mobilizing them.

We argue that different types of knowledge exchanges will exhibit different dominant structural features. We utilize the structural concepts of triadic closure and structural holes as they apply to single and multiple relationships, and drawing on network data of various interorganizational learning ties between members of a biotechnology consortium, analyzed with univariate and multivariate exponential random graph (ERG) models, we provide evidence that largely support our theoretical framework.

A firms external memory as represented by its advisor network, in contrast, inhibits such responses. We further theorize that a firms internal memory negatively moderates the effects of its external memory. We test these ideas using a sample of 181 surprise events identified from 1,725 pages of interview transcripts and informant self-rating reports. Findings support that firm internal memory and external memory differentially affect firm improvisation.

In support of our theory, we find evidence that VC partnerships learn not only from other partnerships dissolving but also from others that do not dissolve. Initial market entry and direct experiences differentially affect this selection of referent firms so that non-dissolving partnerships more strongly influence focal dissolution decisions than dissolving partnerships. Direct experiences further moderate the effects of vicarious learning. Additionally, we find that the influence emanating from less experienced non-dissolving partnerships is stronger than that from more experienced non-dissolving partnerships. Our study advances organizational learning theory by explicating how and why vicarious learning in discontinuation decisions is distinct from vicarious learning in initiation decisions.

Strong dependence on external context also prevented a radical deinstitutionalisation in SOEs. As a result, SOEs are pursuing contradictory and mutually exclusive ends simultaneously and these ends cant be traded off for each other. They are facing paradoxes at various levels of the organisation. Paradoxes do not lend themselves to resolution through formal logics. Understanding paradoxes is the first step towards managing them. Paradoxes offer us an opportunity to advance theory. In this paper we develop a framework of multi-level paradoxes that exist in SOEs.

Moreover, the effectiveness of imitation as a way of identifying and spreading better technologies depends on the structure and density of connections among actors in the population. A model of imitative adaptation is defined and exercised to explore the relation between the density of connections and the effectiveness of imitation in identifying and spreading better technologies in noisy worlds. The optimum density is shown to be quite low under a wide variety of conditions. The results show that populations will find it disadvantageous to have a high density of connections among their members when there are uncertainties in observing and imitating successful others.

While social positions are collectively determined by constituents along multiple evaluative criteria, each of those criteria has differential relative importance under different institutional logics.  Therefore, social actors relative positions along each evaluative criterion have divergent effects on their search behavior in different contexts.  In this paper, we argue that lower positions in a primary evaluative criterion are likely to trigger problemistic search, while higher positions in an ancillary evaluative criterion lead to slack search.

Most noteworthy, Marchs (1991) finding that rapid learning undermines long-run adaptation no longer holds. Instead, the rate of interpersonal learning affects the diversity of beliefs within the organization and whether the organization achieves knowledge about few or many aspects of its environment.

A smaller literature has proposed demand-side factors such as shopping costs, learning costs or costs of interoperability as basis for business expansion, where firms expand their business in order to sell several products to the same customer. In such demand-side driven diversification, firms focus on increasing the customers willingness-to-pay for a combination of products rather than reducing the focal firms cost base through economies of scope. We propose the concept of unique demand complementarities as a unifying framework to explain demand-side driven diversification. We argue that unique demand complementarities can be viewed as a firms unique resource or capability to create and exploit increased willingness-to-pay, leading to competitive advantage based on differentiation. Through analytical modeling, we show that the expected performance of diversification through economies of scope and unique demand complementarities differs substantially and that performance effects are different in terms of market share gain and firm profitability. We further find that the performance effect of unique demand complementarities depends on market share and market connectedness.",diversification| demand-based theory| resource-based view

We argue that although the core business may provide resources such as knowledge to a related segment, it may also potentially constrain the segment in various transactions such that its interests as opposed to the interests of the segment are best served. This may lead to the segment experiencing added bureaucratic costs within a diversified firm compared to when it is a standalone, single business firm. Using a multilevel model with the segment as the unit of analysis, we show that a segments efficiency is lower when it shares backward and forward complementarity (i.e. when it shares transactions with common suppliers and customers) with the core business. In addition the segments efficiency is lower when it provides inputs and buys outputs from the core business (i.e. when it shares backward and forward vertical relatedness with the core). Our analyses correspondingly reveal that the core businesses efficiency is enhanced when it shares transactions and relatedness with a segment. These findings are consistent with value maximization and suggest that the power exerted by the core business is an important source of bureaucratic costs experienced by related segments in diversified firms.",diversification| transaction cost economics| performance

There are strong arguments for a more thorough investigation of the contingencies of indirect control. This study proposes that there exist certain employee characteristics that cause managerial dependence. Managers faced with dependence rely more intensely on indirect controls.

Second, we show that the relationship between control and performance is dependent upon the emphasis owner-managers place on a set of HRM-practices, which we integrate as ""quasi-controls"" in our research model. Managers emphasizing these HRM-practices should especially benefit from output and professional management control.

Because of these conditions, existing strategic leadership practices may no longer be sufficient to lead the firms of today. In response to this realization, others have suggested that a new form of leadership  transcendent leadership  may be a more appropriate leadership response in todays challenging competitive environments. Transcendent leadership represents a form of strategic leadership whereby top managers are able to transcend organizational levels, simultaneously exhibiting leadership of self, others, and the organization. This view of leadership is more holistic in its theoretical approach, but consistent with existing theories on leadership as it relates to potential positive performance implications at the individual and organizational levels. Unfortunately, due to the early stage of theory development surrounding transcendent leadership theory, the lack of empirical analysis on the construct leaves these performance impacts unknown. A substantial contribution of this study is the validation of an instrument to measure perceptions of transcendent leadership capabilities. Our measure serves as a tool to assess the degree to which organizational members evaluate the qualities and behaviors of their leaders in such a way that performance differences could be better understood.

Results show that founding rates of CLECs were higher in states that had previously adopted regulatory programs consistent with the ideology of competition.  I argue that these pre-deregulation actions provided states with institutional capabilities that helped them implement the federal policy and attract entrepreneurs.  Results also show that the relationship between institutional capabilities and entrepreneurship was stronger in states with Democrat-controlled regulatory agencies or Democratic governors.  This latter finding was unanticipated given the Republican Partys reputation as a proponent of free market solutions and the fact that Republicans more strongly backed federal deregulation.

I contend that the prevailing view about spatial proximity  that high spatial density leads to greater opportunities to expand ones network  is at best incomplete and potentially misleading. Instead, I argue that an individuals spatial proximity must be considered in an ecological context  i.e., in relation to the location and expertise of proximate colleagues. Using a unique dataset of email communication patterns, fine-grained blueprints of office-locations, scientific publication records and associated keywords, as well as the formal organization chart from the research division of a biotechnology firm, I find that co-location alone is not associated with an individuals ability to assume network positions that bridge structural holes. In fact, spatial proximity to workgroup (i.e., same laboratory) members inhibits an individuals ability to form networks that reach across the organization. By contrast, proximity conditioned on the expertise overlap of nearby, non-workgroup (i.e., different laboratory) colleagues is associated with having a less constrained network (i.e., one rich in structural holes). Lastly, spatial ecological effects are as important as human capital in providing an individual with opportunities to occupy brokering positions in the network. This paper contributes to the literature on networks and the organization of innovative work by developing a theory of spatial ecology and demonstrating its connection to network structural features that have been repeatedly linked to superior performance in knowledge production contexts.",propinquity| network antecedents| organizational ecology

Second, we examine how the loss of actors who perform generalist and specialist roles in the network may differentially affect robustness.  We find that unlike other types of networks, such as hub-and-spoke networks that crumble into fragments when central actors are lost, small world networks stay intact and instead slowly become less and less small-worldly as they lose both their high clustering and their short path lengths  suggesting that central actors are particularly important to stabilizing a small world structure.  Further, at all levels of centrality, the effects of the loss of generalists and specialists on the network are comparably destabilizing in magnitude but have divergent effects  the loss of generalists drive a small world network towards a cave man network while the loss of specialists drive it towards a network that is random in structure  suggesting that generalists and specialists have complementary roles that help keep a small world small.",small worlds| robustness| social networks

Building on the models of brokerage developed by Gould and Fernandez (1989), a typology of brokers actions (or brokerage plays) is advanced. The impact of these different plays on the dynamics of brokerage roles is explored through detailed longitudinal observation of two transactions brokered by the same broker and unfolding in the same organizational context. Findings show that the overt simultaneous performance of a coordinator and representative brokerage role may lead the disconnected parties to communicate directly, thereby making the broker lose his advantageous structural position.

Both types of benefits are valuable yet appear to be mutually exclusive and hence give rise to the brokerage-closure dilemma. A number of potential solutions to this dilemma have been suggested, but all require changes to an overall networkan approach which can be complicated, time consuming and difficult, if not impossible, for an individual to achieve. We propose and test a simpler solution that combines the network and dyadic (relationship) level of analysis. Specifically, we argue that a bridging tie, i.e., a tie that spans a structural hole between previously disconnected network clusters, will yield more useful knowledge when it is also a strong tie, since strong ties tend to be trusted and so can act as a substitute for the benefits of network closure. Using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) on a sample of 408 knowledge-seeking relationships in a large U.S. engineering firm, we find broad support for this view. We also test and find support for the idea that it is the relational dimension (trust) in particular, rather than tie strength per se, that enhances the value of bridging ties.",social networks| structural holes| trust

First generation KMS are designed to facilitate coding of knowledge so it can be reused on a large scale. In a context of fiercer competition between PSFs on costs and delivery time, and a propensity by clients to sue in the event of any problems, do these systems make the work process more standardisable, and therefore more formally controllable? This interpretative, exploratory case study, conducted between 1999 and 2008 in an international business law firm, suggests that use of KMS brings about a new mode of control that removes the need for a controller by creating lateral pressure between peers on the technical quality of the output produced.

In this model, organizational capability is conceptualized as an amphidromous configuration of a firms knowledge domains and routines.

1690,,2|The Capability Life Cycle and Firm Boundaries: An Evolutionary Theory of Transaction Costs,1|Aseem Kaul|U. of Minnesota||,,"This paper presents a co-evolutionary view of the relationship between capabilities, transaction costs and the boundaries of the firm. The creation of new capabilities is associated with endogenous uncertainty, the need for experiential learning and the threat of ex-post bargaining arising out of the recombination of scarce resources. These characteristics of the exploration process make hierarchical governance the optimal way for entrepreneurs to appropriate the Schumpeterian rents from their newly developed capabilities. Firms are thus seen as a way for entrepreneurs to create ex-ante limits to competition while attempting to develop new capabilities. Once the capability has been established, however, the entrepreneur can divest resources that are asset-specific but not firm-specific, realizing the value of her innovation through the market for corporate control. Only firm-specific resources, which yield scarcity rents for the entrepreneur, need be retained within the firm. The paper thus presents a theoretical model of a transaction cost life cycle with resources being internalized to develop new capabilities, then being made available to the market once the capability has been established, for use by other entrepreneurs in developing further capabilities. In doing so, the paper offers an integration of the organizational economics and organizational capabilities literature that is grounded in the literature on firm innovation and search.",transaction cost| capabilities| evolutionary theory

Relying on insights from transaction value theory, transaction cost theory and social exchange theory, we develop propositions on how pre-acquisition relational investments and post-acquisition integration costs jointly influence a firms decision to shift from collaborative to integrative governance structures. Based on this conceptual analysis, we develop a relational options perspective that allows expanding the application domain of options thinking to organizational settings that are dominated by endogenous sources of uncertainty and value creation.",options theory| organizational governance| alliances and acquisitions

The basic premise is that decisions to invest in a new process are based first on a cost comparison between in-house production and market supply, but also that supplier asset specificity can stimulate a buyer to invest in a new process to avoid transaction costs, akin to arguments in the literature on technical change. The data come from a component fabrication division that is similar to but not the same as that studied by Walker and Weber (1984). The results show that supplier asset specificity does predict buyer process innovation and that such innovation gives the buyer a production cost advantage over the suppliers market price. Further, a close replication of Walker and Webers (1984) model shows that, in contrast to this papers results, only production costs and not imputed transaction costs influence the make or buy decision. The effect of transaction costs on vertical integration is therefore indirect through their influence on buyer process innovation which lowers the buyers production costs compared to the suppliers price and justifies internalizing the activity. The implications for research on the relative importance of transaction costs and organizational competences are discussed.",transaction costs| vertical integration| process innovation

This paper studies the situation of two firms with complementary resources choosing a governance mechanism. Using agent-based simulations, the paper shows how complexity of the firms and of the interfirm ties and the firms dynamic capabilities may impact the amount of value created by the dyad under different governance modes. The results suggest that firm characteristics such as complexity and dynamic capabilities may impact the performance of the various governance forms in distinct ways, and that no single governance form is best in all cases. Thus, the choice of the governance form will depend both on the properties of the transaction and on firm characteristics.

Evidence from Mergers and Acquisitions,1|Lubomir Litov|Washington U. in St Louis||2|Todd Zenger|Washington U. in St Louis||,,"Using mergers and acquisitions as a testing ground we examine whether managers face conflicting incentives in selecting the uniqueness of their corporate strategy.  We argue that firms that pursue strategies which assemble commonly-bundled assets (or business lines) will pay more for their target assets and will perform less well in the long run, yet will receive more positive announcement returns at the time of asset acquisitions.   We find empirically that acquirers, who as an outcome of their acquisitions become more similar to their rivals, and hence easier to analyze within that industry, receive a significantly higher positive announcement return. The increase in abnormal announcement returns (-1 to +1 day around event) between the bottom and top deciles on our measure of dissimilarity of the new company with its rivals is 1.01%. Such acquirers, however, exhibit weak subsequent economic performance due perhaps to the higher price paid for targets in said acquisitions. On average, acquirers in the bottom decile of our uniqueness measure pay 13.6% more for their targets than acquirers in the top decile on our uniqueness measure; they also have subsequent one-year-post-merger-closing profitability which is about 1.25% lower than their more opaque peer group. These findings are stronger for a measure of uniqueness that compares the surviving corporation to the primary industry rivals that are covered by analysts.

We use signaling theory to develop theoretical arguments on the dual effects of signals in M&A markets:  Signals are beneficial to an acquirer in reducing its risk of adverse selection, but have the drawback of offering similar benefits to other potential bidders.  This creates a contracting problem for the focal acquirer that risks losing any deal-specific investments it makes in due diligence, negotiations, and post-acquisition planning if the target would sell to another firm.  Under these conditions, acquirers can secure the deal by negotiating termination payment provisions (TPPs) in the form of termination fees and lockup options.  Our empirical analyses focus upon acquisitions of newly-public firms and reveal that market signals available during and after the IPO increase the usage of TPPs in acquisition contracting.",initial public offerings| mergers and acquisitions| termination fees

We identify the institutional context of firms as the source of such influence rents. To aid the analysis of the relationship between institutional context and firm performance and to provide a structure to guide research, we develop a framework with five key components: a) an identification of the five fundamental problems of a market economy, b) a typology that describes the five different types of institutions that emerge to solve these problems, c) the market-ordering mechanisms used by institutions to solve these problems, d) the common causes of weak institutional performance, and e) generic strategies used by firms to exploit these weaknesses of an institutional context to enhance firm performance.

Thus the industry provides a unique opportunity to study the role of cross national institutional differences on the performance of international business in a globalizing economy. We investigate whether and how cross national institutional differences affect the performance of international VC syndicates and the roles that international experience plays in attenuating the impacts of such differences. We argue that differences in national informal and formal institutions are reflected in value systems, standard operating procedures, contingency response patterns, and in the ways of perceiving, communicating, and relating. Such differences are likely to increase transaction costs and conflict, reduce the effectiveness of collaboration among syndicate partners, and amplify the liability of foreignness in relations with the investee. Some cross national differences, however, also represent opportunities permitting the exploitation of complementarities. We also argue that while international experience may close the gaps in formal institutional differences, which are reflected more strongly in practices, it is less likely to close the gaps in cultural differences, which are reflected more strongly in values. Based on over 11,000 international venture capital investments between 1990 and 2008, we find strong empirical evidence to support our theoretical arguments.

In a second step we develop propositions about potential M&A research findings in the Chinese context. This analysis enables us to extract a set of contextual factors that are most relevant and serves as a preliminary answer to the question which institutions matter. This list of context factors is valuable providing a set of additional variables that can be put under empirical scrutiny. Further on, a hierarchy of institutional components emerges, reaching from culture, education, formal-institutions to stages of economic development. Influence and potential relationships of these components are systematically explored.

The study argues that the formation of the Global Compact's legitimacy crucially depends on audiences' generalizations of the legitimacy of corporate signatories. The proclaimed interdependence of legitimacy objects implies that increasing numbers of best-practice examples in the corporate sector are likely to raise the legitimacy of the Global Compact, constituting a positive legitimacy spillover for the initiative. By the same token, corporate misuse or disregard of the Compact's principles and its aggravation by mass-mediated scandalization discredit the Global Compact as a vital instrument for private governance, entailing a negative legitimacy spillover for the initiative. The study makes the following contributions to the study of transnational institutions: First, we illuminate the multi-level character of legitimacy spillovers and offer a bottom-up account for the emergence and consolidation of transnational entities. Second, by drawing upon the cognitive psychology literature on heuristic reasoning, we develop a model of legitimacy substitution and present testable propositions for both strength and direction of spillovers. More general, the study highlights the fact that in an era of mass-mediated reality the legitimacy of transnational organizations becomes - for better or for worse - cognitively intertwined with the legitimacy of lower-level organizations.",heuristic reasoning| legitimacy spillover| transnational private governance

State regulators impelled ownership reform but did not dictate the price of reform  the amount of compensation paid to tradable shareholders.  Instead, compensation was negotiated between the two groups of owners.  Non-tradable shareholders preferred to offer less compensation, tradable shareholders preferred to receive more compensation, and company executives, who brokered these deals, wanted the reform succeed at almost any price.  When owners were better able to monitor company executives and other agents, compensation was set closer to owners preferences.  Net of conflicts between shareholders and their agents, imitation of other firms strongly affected compensation.

We make propositions regarding social capital needs depending on the idiosyncratic characteristics of each of the three processes underlying dynamic capabilities: reconfiguration, coordination & integration, and learning. This allows us to show how resources can be leveraged from networks to build dynamic capabilities. We also highlight a recursive relationship between social capital and dynamic capabilities and its effects on the firms asset structure, providing new insight into the micro-foundations of dynamic capabilities. Further, this ability to efficiently manage social capital can be seen as a dynamic capability in itself. At network level, it implies that there is no single ideal balance between brokerage and closure. Awareness of these aspects highlights the strategic importance of social capital steering for more efficient management of resources and competences.

In this paper, we introduce the concept of dynamic capacity as the firms ability to integrate routinized and ad-hoc adaptation. Drawing on the micro-processes of sensing, seizing, and reconfiguration, we explain how the density of a firms rule regime regulates the pace of change. Consequently, the dynamic capacity facilitates a differentiation between different modes of adaptation and, therefore, pushes the envelope of the dynamic capabilities approach.",microfoundation| adaptation| dynamic capabilities

More knowledge is costly to acquire and is not always better -- not every cross-border acquisitions needs ex ante investments in learning about the environment or the target.",cross-border acquisitions| information asymmetry| knowledge acquisition

Using a mixed effects modeling framework, we explicitly model the variability in the effects of corporate environmental performance on corporate financial performance. We partition the variance in these effects by industry, firm size, and local political contexts.

Our quantitative- and qualitative investigation of Fortune Global 500 firms response to the 2004 tsunami and the 2005 Kashmiri earthquake indicates that CPDR is driven by a mix of attentiveness to employees and their other-interested prosocial identities, contextual attention-enabling mechanisms, and the overall salience of the event.

We argue that the answers to these research questions critically depend on the nature of political strategy. We first draw on the corporate political strategy literature in management and economics which has focused primarily on rent-seeking political strategy, and propose that rent-seeking political strategy and market strategies are substitutes, and that weaker firms (i.e., firms with lesser market capabilities) are more likely to use political strategies to seek refuge from competitive forces. We then examine a different type of political strategy, the hazard-reducing political strategy, which helps firms to safeguard their market production from hazards of public and private expropriation; drawing on institutional economics and international business, we propose that hazard-reducing political strategy and market strategies are complements, and that stronger firms stand to benefit more from hazard-reducing political strategy. Finally, we discuss rule-setting political strategy and compare it with the previous two types. This perspective has novel implications for the integration of firms' nonmarket strategy and market strategy.",political strategy| market capability| nonmarket strategy

We argue that firms frequently use corporate responsibility initiatives as part of their ""image repertoire"" when dealing with the threat of boycotts.

Adam Cobb|U. of Michigan||,,"The predominant depiction of the American corporation as an employer in the 1950s is an image of stability (Kochan, 1996).  Through a confluence of events, a system of workplace governance emerged among the largest corporations in the United States that established long-term employment relationships between workers and firms, and many commentators noted the have characterized this system of workplace governance as an employment contract (e.g. Cappelli, 1999; Osterman, 1999).  The major tenets of this contract were that earnings increases were linked to improvements in productivity and long term employment was guaranteed in exchange for worker loyalty (Osterman, Kochan, Locke, & Piore, 2001, Ch. 1).  However, since the early 1980s this implicit social contract has been challenged.  I argue that one way to study the changing employment relationship is to look at transformations in the institutions which helped establish the preexisting social contract.  One such institution is the defined benefit pension plan.  In a study of 371 of the largest firms over a 9 year period, I take predictions from neo-institutional and resource-dependence theory to test hypotheses related the transition from defined benefit to defined contribution retirement plans.  The results show that higher levels of industry unionization was negatively related to lower levels of defined contribution participants but had no significant effect on defined benefit participants, more productive workforces were negatively related to the number of participation for both types of plans, and greater experience in offering defined benefit plans is positively related to defined benefit participants.

This study focuses on praxis at the organizational level, recognizing that organizations are a primary context within which actors acquire the meanings, power and resources that allow them to create new practices, some of which diffuse to create change in institutional fields.  Drawing upon existing models of praxis (Benson, 1977; Seo & Creed, 2002), we develop and analyze a longitudinal case study to examine the elements of praxis within an organization which initiated a new practice that subsequently diffused across the field. Our analysis reveals a new aspect of praxis, choice, which bridges the reflective and active dimensions of praxis.

Categories,  Stigma,  and Symbolic Performance in the Global Arms Industry",1|Jean-Philippe Vergne|HEC Paris||,,"This paper connects categorization and stigmatization processes to explain variation in a firm's symbolic performance. By arguing that organizational categories can coincide with stigma to form stigmatized categories, I propose the notion of stigma dilution to explain how firms operating in a contested terrain can improve their symbolic performance. Three particular categorization processes are examined, based respectively on cognitive association between a firm and its home country, its customers, and its output. Besides, organizational categories are not equally salient to industry stakeholders, so the effect of stigma dilution on symbolic performance varies over time with the social prominence of categorization processes. The theory is tested using unique qualitative and quantitative data on the global arms industry (1996-2007), a contested industry that has received little attention in previous organizational research. Empirical results strongly support the paper's ideas and show an interesting pattern with respect to the consequences of 9/11 in the arms industry.

Using a matched sample of firms reporting earnings restatements (141 single restating firms and 141 multiple restating firms), we find (1) that the stigma associated with a first admission of misconduct licences firms to engage in additional acts of misconduct without incurring the same penalties the second time around, and (2) that firms can effectively regain legitimacy after engaging in misconduct by replacing their CEO prior to publicly announcing the misconduct, but only when the CEO is replaced with an outsider. We argue the first finding is representative of a licensing effect of stigma, an unexpected positive outcome from a predominantly negative labelling process. We argue that the second finding is representative of how stigma can be successfully transferred from firms to associated organizational elites.  We suggest that doing so permits the firm to re-establish its legitimacy even in the face of misconduct admissions because the leadership change re-frames new admissions of misconduct in a more positive light. Both findings help us understand why corporate misconduct may be so persistent and intractable.",misconduct| stigma| restatements

To answer these questions, I focus on two possible constraints on the organizational use of legitimacy strategy - heterogeneity in audiences and path-dependency in symbolic management - and try to show how organization chooses and coordinates various strategic options for repairing its legitimacy under these constraints which emerge with their strategic moves to deal with legitimacy crisis. I extracted legitimacy management histories of a firm suffering legitimacy crisis recently from press accounts and key-informant interviews.

We examine three conditions: source of external resource (cluster and network), characteristics of external resources (volume and quality of technological resources), and types of firm (technologically strong or weak) that access the external resources. Results from firm-level panel data during the years 1986-2000 of publicly traded, U.S.-based, semiconductor firms show that although both sources of external resources generally increase the likelihood of breakthrough innovation, the impacts of the quality of cluster and network technological resources are different for different types of firms. While technologically strong firms benefit from the resources of other firms in their cluster, they benefit less from the resources in their network. Furthermore, we find that technologically weak firms seem to reap complementary benefits from their cluster and network resources, but such resources have a substitution effect for technologically strong firms. Technologically weak firms generate high breakthrough innovations when both cluster resources and network resources are high. However, technologically strong firms would be better off when cluster resources are high but network resources are low.",cluster| network| innovation

By raising the supply of information in a region, they encourage specialization of more knowledge-intensive workers in knowledge-intensive activities. If this also weakens the complementarity across skills, the region will experience greater wage inequality. We then discuss four antecedents of localized knowledge spillover: market and technological specialization, science-based knowledge intensity and cultural openness. We test our theory by using data on 146 U.S. cities. Since managers and production workers are widespread occupations, and they are not industry-specific, we employ the ratio between their salaries as our city-level proxy of the dependent variable. We find that that cities with higher intensity of localized knowledge spillovers exhibit higher wage inequality across skills. We control for several factors, including inter-industry differences, and we take into account the potential endogeneity of knowledge spillovers. We also find that downstream market specialization and cultural openness are statistically significant antecedents.",wage inequality| knowledge spillovers| cultural traits

While boundary spanning individual mechanism is a widely discussed and utilized knowledge transfer mechanism, it is insufficient for transferring collectively held knowledge. In this paper, we propose an alternative knowledge transfer mechanism   bridge network, which is a multiplex inter communal link between the source and recipient organizational units, as a potential mechanism for transferring collectively held knowledge. By comparing the cost effectiveness of this mechanism with boundary spanner individuals under different knowledge contexts, we suggest that boundary spanning individual mechanism is more cost effective to transfer discrete knowledge, whereas bridge network is more cost effective to transfer collectively held knowledge.",knowledge transfer mechanisms| collectively held knowledge| boundary spanners

Executive succession events provide a salient opportunity for institutional change in organizations. It is argued that the less familiarity a new executive has with the organization and the field it works in, the more likely is subsequent radical institution change. Empirical results from quantitative analysis of executive succession events in Danish municipalities from 1984  2000 generally confirm this. Hiring an executive successor from outside the field of municipalities is associated with subsequent radical institutional change. Also executive successors from within the field are, somewhat surprisingly, associated with comprehensive changes while internal promotions are associated with changes convergent to existing institutional norms. Interestingly, the degree of institutionalization moderates the findings. Inside successors become more likely to conduct comprehensive structural changes as new institutional practices receive normative and regulatory endorsement.

Previous research on the role of social relations in innovation adoption has pointed to the importance of social relations on firm decisions; however, most studies examine only a single relation's effects at one time. Such a single-study, single-relation approach has led to a long list of potential network culprits but has limited knowledge about which relations matter and under what larger environmental or institutional conditions. This analysis tests four network proximities: geographic, market competition, reputational similarity, and senior management ties. Using an originally collected database of the migration of senior managers amongst the Fortune 100 from 1985-2001 to create management ties between firms and a diffusion model that distinguishes between firms intrinsic characteristics, susceptibility, and infectiousness, the study finds management ties to be a robust predictor of the timing of Internet adoption. It also teases apart status effects on adoption: Results show that rather than following the lead of powerful American firms with top reputations, firms were more influenced by their reputation peers and by those with top reputations for technological innovation. The paper concludes that relational proximities are an important causal mechanism connecting micro-level decision analyses with macro-level studies of institutional and organizational change, but that future work should test more rigorously multiple relations against one another to advance theoretical integration.",diffusion| networks| innovation

An emerging new financial sociology has shown that the social interactions of finance professionals are critical to the functioning of financial markets. This study provides a quantitative dimension to this emerging literature, using hierarchical linear models to demonstrate that clannishness, gossip and paradoxical imitation each impact hedge fund investment returns. Elite managers belong highly-cohesive mentorship-based lineages (i.e. clans). As a few individuals belong to multiple lineages, these clans are loosely linked. This study finds finds that highly-central managers within this elite gain a small but significant investment advantage, perhaps because they know what the various clans are doing. Gossip is also important as managers trade information with their former co-workers. This study finds that managers who have high closeness centrality within these gossip networks manage risks better. Imitation paradoxically harms the imitators. Many hedge fund managers copy elite managers investment patterns. A large academic literature suggests that imitation is rational and beneficial. However, this study finds that imitators harm themselves, possibly because they follow trends instead of leading them. By investing into a bubble, they risk exiting these investments too late. Most interestingly, this study finds that hedge fund managers behave differently during economic crises than they do under normal conditions. Facing high uncertainty, they fall back upon their social networks, and engage in greater imitation. This insight opens a wedge for the sociological study of financial crises--and the manias and panics involved.",social networks| hedge funds| sociology of finance

But they exist within a socially created organizational field, where founding entrepreneurs first performance goal is survival.  One method by which founding entrepreneurs seek to enhance their survival probabilities is by learning and mimetically copying existing firms structures and practices.  Institutional theory suggests that mimetic processes generate legitimacy and hence survival advantages, especially in uncertain and ambiguous environments.  Organizational learning theory suggests firms actively learn from peer organizations experience and mimic success.

In the present study we synthesize previously reported tests of this perspective through a meta-analysis of 175 studies on the adoption and performance effects of five resource dependence tactics in varying intensity: interlocks, alliances, joint ventures, in-sourcing, and mergers and acquisitions. Our results corroborate the theorys core prediction: environmental interdependencies are positively associated with the adoption of resource dependence tactics, which are in turn positively associated with organizational performance. Building on these results we extend current theorizing in three ways. First, we show that not all tactics are equally suited for the management of interdependencies. We explain their differential success by detailing the trade-off between interdependence reduction and organizational flexibility. Second, we demonstrate that the adoption of tactics has a larger positive effect on organizations symbolic performance than on their substantive performance, which offers new opportunities for reconciling resource dependence and institutional theories of organizations. Third, by combining multiple single-country studies into a single multi-country study we are able to show that the relationship between adoption and organizational performance is significantly moderated by legal and judicial factors.",symbolic and substantive performance| alliances| mergers and acquisitions| resource dependence theory

In line with the literature on modulation we find that the norms, expectations, and inter-organizational processes took several years to adapt to the shift in Nissanfs formal approach.

Using a series of model specifications I quantify the importance of this revenue source as well as competitor actions on agency decisions of who to rate and how to rate. While I find that revenue source matters, so does market power, resulting in three distinct groups of competitors  issuer-paid market leaders (S&P and Moodys), issuer-paid challengers and subscriber-paid challengers.

I argue that variation in asymmetric information between the potential entrant and incumbent allow for identification of the incumbents use of limit pricing; limit pricing should only be used when there exist high levels of asymmetric information, not low levels of asymmetric information.  I study a market, the US cable TV industry, in which the incumbent interacts with two types of potential entrants: telecom overbuilders and cable overbuilders.  There are information asymmetries between the incumbent and potential telecom entrant, but fewer information asymmetries between the incumbent and potential cable entrant.  As predicted by limit pricing theory, I find evidence that the incumbent firm uses low price when telecom overbuilders threaten entry, but not when cable overbuilders entry.

In contrast, we virtually lack any knowledge on how the timing of strategic actions which involve the shedding of resources, such as divestitures, affect firm performance. This paper thus aims at advancing our understanding of the importance of divestiture timing. Specifically, we analyze how the timing of a divestiture relative to industry peers in the context of an industry divestiture wave affects a sellers stockmarket returns. Our large-scale empirical analyses are conducted across eleven industries covering a total of 2478 divestitures during the time period from 1993 to 2007. Findings suggest that companies that divest ahead of industry peers at the outset of a divestiture wave and companies that bide their time and divest after industry divestiture activity has peaked outperform companies that divest at the peak of a wave. Surprisingly, late divestors in an industry divestiture wave generate even higher announcement returns than early divestors. A sellers financial performance is found to amplify the impact of divestiture timing on stockmarket returns in industry divestiture waves. The relatedness of the divested unit with the parent firm has no moderating influence on the relationship between divestiture timing and stockmarket returns.",divestiture| timing| industry wave

Using a unique data set that contains all the Best Buy and Circuit City stores in the United States, the authors find that a stores product variety (measured as the number of stock-keeping units) increases if a rival store also locates in the local geographic market. The variety decreases when the rival store is collocated (within one mile of the focal store). This observation may be due to the possible existence of coordinated interactions between collocated stores. Moreover, collocated rivals stores are more inclined to differentiate themselves by carrying fewer overlapping products than do pairs of distant rivals. In summary, this article presents evidence for the existence of both coordination and competition in the strategic use of product variety in retailing.",product variety| competition| collocation

Naive intuition might suggest that the performance of imperfect (boundedly rational) imitation will be somewhat less than that which may be garnered by perfect (fully rational) imitation of market leaders. Employing a computational model, we find that imperfect imitation can generate unexpectedly good outcomes - indeed better than the outcomes achieved if firms were perfect imitators. This finding recasts the role of imitation in the strategy literature. It has been typically portrayed as the second-best strategy (relative to innovation) by which a follower may at best catch up with the market leader. Our work recasts boundedly rational imitation as a strategy that gives rise to the possibility of surpassing the leader. In this sense, imperfect imitation is, under suitable conditions, a good substitute for innovation. Moreover, at the industry (population) level, imperfect imitation increases the average performance of all firms in the industry relative to that which can be achieved if firms were perfect imitators.

On the supply side, our theory incorporates multiple organizational design choices; on the demand side, we incorporate heterogeneous buyers with preferences over multiple product attributes.  Critical parameters are the extent of trade-offs firms face in setting attribute levels and the degree of interactions among organizational design decisions.  We use a value-based approach to characterize competitive interactions in the marketplace.  Our focus is on the choice of positions by firms and the extent to which different industries support heterogeneity in positions.  In contrast to classic arguments by Porter, we find that increasing the extent of trade-offs can increase the number of viable competitive positions that can be occupied in an industry, and thereby reduce the need for choice.  In contrast to prior work on NK models of rugged landscapes, we find that increases in policy interdependencies  among design decisions (i.e., increases in K) can decrease the number of viable competitive positions, and thereby reduce heterogeneity in competitive positions in an industry.",competitive positioning| value-based strategy| nk landscape

We draw on the behavioral theory of bricolage from the entrepreneurship literature to suggest one such mechanism by which firms may develop such resource-based advantages. The core of our argument is that idiosyncratic bundling processes synonymous with bricolage behavior may create advantageous resource positions by (i) allowing resource constrained firms to allocate more of their limited resources to activities that they view as more strategically important, and (ii) increasing the difficulties other firms face in trying to imitate these advantages. Based on this reasoning we develop several hypotheses which we test in the context of several samples from a large, longitudinal, Australian study of new firm development. The results support our arguments that bricolage will improve a firms overall resource positions while generating more areas of strong resource advantage and fewer areas of strong resource disadvantage.  We find little support, however, for our arguments that bricolage will make a firms key resource advantages more difficult for other firms to imitate.

It can createvalue thanks to client-specific economies of scope. In this paper, I exploit the preferences revealed by the configuration of buyer-supplier relationships to investigate the nature of client-specific economies of scope. I use data from the UK corporate legal market to estimate the relative importance of cost, product line expertise and client-specific scope economies in value creation.The results point to two sources of increasing returns that underpin client-specific economies of scope in this setting. First, I find evidence of a large opportunity cost of terminating a buyer-supplier relationship, suggesting the existence of a significant fixed cost of creating a relationship. Second, although there is evidence of negative spillovers between product lines, the negative spillovers appear to dissipate as supplier scope increases, thereby justifying broader supplier scope.Methodologically, this paper contributes to bridging the gap between value-based models of strategy and empirical applications. The necessary conditions underlying the estimation stem directly from this class of models and the estimates can therefore be used for out-of-sample analyses.",value-based strategy| client-specific scope economies| buyer-supplier relationships

After years of scholarly neglect, interest in hope has  resurfaced internationally and across disciplines; within the organizational literature, hope is currently conceptualized as an aspect of positive organizational behavior, a component of psychological capacity, and a leadership competency necessary in facing the challenges of the 21st century. The existing literature on hope is expansive. Yet, a universally-accepted definition of hope is still elusive as is a clear understanding of how both the positive and the less constructive aspects of hope might be harnessed to the benefit of the workforce, organizations and societies. Based on literature review, hope is defined  in this paper as that aspect of the human spirit that is experienced as a passion for the possible (Meissner, 1973)  meaning a tenacious appetite for deliberately creating the future through responsible living and working.  Three gaps in the existing hope literature are identified in the first part of the paper which lead to a preliminary answer of the research question in the second part of the paper: hope can be harnessed as a means of achieving healthy high performance by keeping hope reality-based, by empowering the workforce to create the future through responsible living and working, through employee engagement, and by evaluating the effectiveness of hope based on beneficial results.",health| wellness| well-being| high performance| leadership| hope| spirituality| positive organizational behavior

The paper is based on a study that explored the experience of leaders who have found a way to synchronize their own personal meaning with the mission of the organization in which they lead, and the relationship of this meaning and mission alignment to well-being. The search for meaning beyond ones own existence is of chief concern to the soul of humankind (Csikszentmihalyi, 2003) and is the primary motivation of all human beings (Frankl, 1984). Meaning and work are related. Work usually represents the area in which the individuals uniqueness stands in relation to society and thus acquires meaning and value (Frankl, 1968, p. 118). Meaning often derives from a spiritual or religious source. The American view of work was shaped early on by sixteenth century Protestant Reformers Martin Luther and John Calvin, who believed that all vocations were equally valuable in Gods sight and could be used to bring glory to God (Hill & Smith, 2003). More and more, people are looking to work to find meaning in their lives. The historical concept of work as a spiritual calling is resonating with many who feel the need for a larger, lasting meaning in their work that transcends a temporal job, position, or title. Employees who do not find meaning in their work are less productive and more likely to leave the organization to look for meaning elsewhere (Paloutzian, Emmons & Keortge, 2003). Thus, it is incumbent upon organizations to address issues of meaning and well-being in the workplace. Organizations seeking to provide a transcendent meaning to the work that they do often use a mission statement to articulate this meaning as an inspiring cause that resonates with the souls of all employees (Barrett, 2003, p. 354). It is a way to engage employees on a spiritual level.This research on meaning-mission fit incorporates elements of workplace spirituality, positive psychology, and existential analysis. This study proposed a new operationalization of person-organization fit, called meaning-mission fit. Using a sample of executives employed in the music industry, this phenomenological study utilized a series of interviews to obtain descriptions of the experience of aligning personal meaning and organizational mission and the extent to which this meaning-mission fit has a relationship with happiness, job satisfaction, and perceived responsibility for employee emotional well-being. The findings resulted in 6 clusters of themes and 30 individual themes. Exhaustive descriptions of meaning-mission fit and meaning-mission misfit were developed from participants interview responses.

We explore our findings through both positive and critical WPS theory and confirm some of the prerequisites to wholeness that these theories have identified such as a relative measure of self-determination, meaningful work and attending to a several life roles.  But, we also, identify two process themes that complement the current theoretical understanding of the whole person and are better explained by existential theory; 1)  wholeness occurs as a result of the process of attending to being and 2) wholeness occurs as  the result of the process of collectively voicing our humanity (what is and what is not meaningful to us).

First, we review the definition and domain of the intelligence construct and argue that it is a conceptually distinct form of intelligence. Second, we argue that any theory of spiritual intelligence must focus on the spiritual journey as one of epistemological ascent and ontological descent through five distinct levels of being; a journey of self-transcendence or transformation from ego-centered to other-centered while striving to attain a Nondual state of awareness and maintain this state of being or consciousness from moment-to-moment.

We test the model with data on multiple assets from Spanish banks, from a time period when these banks invested heavily in IT capital.  We find that, for the representative bank, 54% of its economic value corresponds to the purchase cost of material and immaterial assets, and the remaining 46% corresponds to contributions in the form of adjustment costs (18%), intangibles (7%) and rents from market power (22%).",intangible assets| organizational capital| economic rents

Using the data of 11 major firms in semiconductors, IT hardware, software and pharmaceuticals between 1989 and 2007, we find that that the R&D stocks of technology leaders depreciate faster than those of followers in semiconductor and IT hardware industries.  However, in the industries where appropriability conditions are stronger, the difference between technology leaders and followers is less clear.  R&D investment of technology leaders is not necessarily more productive than that of the followers, suggesting that followers can benefit from imitation.

There are two issues with R&D expenditure as a measure of effectiveness.  First it is an input measure, so can only be used inferentially to assess effectiveness. Second, its use in models of market value poses a puzzle: increases in R&D increase market value, which shouldn't be true in equilibrium.  Similarly there are three issues with patent counts:  first, less than 50% of firms conducting R&D have any patents; second, there is substantial variance in patents' economic value; third, patents are a poor predictor of firm market value.  Thus patents are neither a universal, uniform, nor reliable measure of R&D effectiveness.  We propose using a measure of R&D effectiveness (IQ) that is all three.  Moreover it is constructed from firm financial data, so can be adopted by academics as well as practitioners at low cost.

The more tightly this constraint restricts compensation under poor performance, the more the firm must compensate by promising increased compensation under good performance in order to attract and retain needed employees.  This intensified carrot-and-stick combination makes it easier for start-ups to motivate higher levels of effort and expected value creation, but also allows greater expected value appropriation by their employees, thereby limiting the range of business opportunities that they can profitably pursue.Paper is No Longer Available Online: Please contact the author(s).",

By analyzing a large-scale sample collected from 316 TMTs via the structural equation modeling approach, the research finds that TMT external social capital promotes internal human capital investments and then external market action aggressiveness so as to bring differential advantage for a firm. Our research extends and reinforces the theoretical link between the upper echelons and competitive dynamics perspectives by building a model that integrates two sequential competitive moves within the broad context of executive external socio-cognitive dynamics and firm ultimate performance. By examining social capital at the TMT level and its implications for competitive behaviors, our study also advances the social capital perspective.",competitive dynamics| top management team| social capital

But, past work examining firms which engage in such misrepresentation has reached conflicting conclusions. This research examines the role of power and influence in shielding the CEO from the effects of financial misrepresentation  represented in this study as SEC-mandated restatement of earnings - that can damage the reputation of the firm (Arthaud-Day, Certo, Dalton, & Dalton, 2006; Beneish, 1999).

Emerging markets like India are also characterized by a large number of family owned and managed businesses. Therefore, we attempt to unravel the moderating influences of family business on the internationalization-governance relationship. We utilized multidimensional and comprehensive measures to assess firms degree of internationalization and to identify family business firms. The use of multiple theoretical lenses drawing from the information processing, agency and resource dependence streams enabled us to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the nature of the impact of internationalization on governance. The extent of internationalization positively influences CEO compensation and the percentage of outside directors on company boards, whereas it negatively influences CEO duality. These findings offer strong support for the information processing and resource dependence perspectives. We find some evidence that family businesses negatively moderate the underlying relationship between internationalization and governance. Therefore, on the one hand family businesses mitigate the primary principal-agency problems, but on the other hand they exacerbate the secondary principal-principal agency problem. This paper contributes to the relatively sparse literature examining internationalization influences on governance, particularly in emerging economies.

In this study, we propose that business group affiliation highlights interest incongruence between controlling owners and affiliated firms, motivating controlling owners to behave more opportunistically. Our analysis of Korean companies shows that controlling owners in independent firms promote R&D particularly when growth opportunities are present.

The relationship between managerial ownership and product diversification has received considerable attention in existing research. However, the link between managerial ownership and international diversification is relatively unexplored. This study seeks to address this gap. We explore whether the incentive alignment perspective from agency theory, which has received support in the case of product diversification, holds true in the context of international diversification. However, we argue the nature of the incentive alignment arguments differ for international diversification. We contend that international diversification is associated with both increased returns and increased levels of firm risk, relative to product diversification. This is due to the greater opportunities that exist in foreign markets, but also the significant challenges posed by expanding into these markets. We investigate the international diversificationmanagerial ownership relationship in both directions. In addition, we examine whether product diversification plays a moderating role in the relationship between international diversification and managerial ownership. Our analysis involves a sample of 1,047 firms from the S&P 1500 over a period of 4 years (1998-2001). Our findings suggest that international diversification is negatively associated with subsequent managerial ownership. Product diversification moderates this relationship, reducing the negative effects of international diversification. Furthermore, managerial ownership is positively associated with subsequent international diversification.

However, this effect captures only in part the complexity of the influence of ownership structure. In fact, we found a positive relationship between controlling share and the stock market reaction to the divestiture event only when the controlling owner of the selling firm was a family. This finding is consistent with the view that family have the strongest incentive to monitor management, thus minimizing the traditional agency costs. Furthermore, by accounting for a second type of agency conflict, namely between majority and minority shareholders, our analysis reveals the existence of a non-linear relationship between family control share and the stock market reaction to the divestiture event.

Such joint task division across R&D is likely to take place when firms have prior collaboration experience, as it reduces the coordination costs in joint task implementation.

Consistent with previous research on presidential leadership, the Ideal President was seen as higher in masculinity than femininity, as were all of the candidates except Sarah Palin.  Only Palin was significantly lower on masculinity than the Ideal President. On the implicit leadership theory scales, the Ideal President was usually higher than the candidates.  On the anti-leader prototype scale, tyranny, the Ideal President was lower than all candidates; Clinton and McCain were highest.  In general, perceptions of Obama improved over time.  There were minimal differences between men and women respondents across all scales. Study findings suggest that leader and anti-leader prototypes as well as gender stereotypes shed light on perceptions of presidential candidates, and that both Palin and Clinton would have image problems to overcome in future presidential elections.",gender| leadership| public sector

We integrated these theoretical perspectives to develop and test a moderated mediation model of the relationship between gender diversity and group performance. We assert that diversity is unlikely to benefit group performance unless typical behavior patterns include openness towards dissimilar others; thus, we examined the moderating role of gender diversity norms (i.e., the extent to which group members typically demonstrate openness and inclusion towards coworkers of the opposite sex) in this research. We proposed that gender diversity and norms interact to predict group information elaboration, which subsequently predicts group performance. In addition, we investigated one potential source of groups gender diversity norms by examining members beliefs about the benefits of gender diversity in group settings (i.e., value-in-diversity beliefs). Two studies - including an organizational field study and a time-lagged study of project teams - support these arguments and the hypothesized model.

Working mothers are at particular risk for such adverse effects, because in addition to a paid work role, they face a heavy second shift (i.e., home/family workload; Hochschild, 1989). They are also less likely to have opportunities for self-care to recover their resources and enhance their well-being. This study's findings indicated that mothers second shift workload was associated with less available time and energy resources, and that available resources were associated with increased self-care behaviors. Also, self-care behaviors were associated with several well-being and work-related outcomes, and experienced stress partially mediated some relationships between self-care and outcomes.

The focus on perceived environmental uncertainty has coexisted with an implicit assumption that differences in forms of objective uncertainty were irrelevant. Studies have been using terms uncertainty and risk interchangeably. The paper argues that concepts of risk and uncertainty do not intersect each other. It shows that risk characterizes competition in a market while uncertainty characterizes competition for a market. In nascent new markets, the informational effectiveness of prices is exceedingly limited, and entrepreneuring managers attempt to resolving uncertainty through paying utmost attention to nonprice signals and creating strategically critical rare unpriced resources. The paper contends that intellectual and analytical frameworks, developed for examining risk-reducing strategies, require substantial rethinking if we want them to be useful in examining uncertainty-reducing strategies.",risk| uncertainty| nonprice signals

Complementing these findings, I find at the industry level that industry sales growth is positively associated with strategic risk-taking intensity over time. The results also suggest that approximately 26% of the variance in strategic risk-taking intensity is due to time effects, 65% of the variance is attributed to firm-level factors, and the remaining 9% variance is due to industry-level characteristics, showing that firm-level factors contribute the greatest to the variance in strategic risk-taking behaviors.",multilevel| time| strategic risk-taking

In the context of this paper, environmental information disclosure, selective reporting appears to have been targeted not at investors or consumers, but at government regulators. Our findings illustrate potential opportunities in the domain of environmental policy for research on symbolic management. Growing concerns over environmental pollution puts increasing institutional pressure on firms to take action. As institutional theory predicts, many firms respond to the institutional pressure, voluntarily reducing emissions, producing green goods designed for minimum environmental impact, etc. These seemingly righteous actions are often criticized as greenwashing and we find evidence in support of this claim.

Drawing from prior theory and research about how narcissists react to stimuli, we hypothesize that highly narcissistic CEOs will be relatively unresponsive to objective indicators of their performance; in contrast, highly narcissistic CEOs will be exceptionally emboldened by social praise (in the forms of media praise and media awards).

Our qualitative, inductive study of nascent firms over seven years revealed that founders use of emotion regulation behaviors can explain differential resource creation at the firm level. These behaviors deal with three emotion-laden tensions (or paradoxes) that firm founders faced: (1) self versus other-orientation, (2) economic ver-sus emotional rewards, and (3) short-term versus long-term focus. They help founders reconcile these tensions and facilitate resource creation for their ventures. We therefore call these emotion regulation behaviors emotional reconciling. Emotional reconciling could be construed as a dynamic capability that helps young firms establish a resource base. Our study contributes to the strategy literature by being the first to establish empirically the link between specific emotion regulation behaviors of founders and the emergence of resource heterogeneity at the firm level.

The level of resource exposure when acquiring the real option moderates the impact small wins has on trust formation.

The context is new venture internationalization. Prior studies argue that strategic change is more likely when firm members adopt internal attributions for surprising negative outcomes, and less likely when firm members adopt external attributions. In contrast, we find that strategic change is affected not only by whether attributions are internal or external but also by whether attributions between the field and headquarters are convergent, divergent, or blended. More broadly, our data reveal a novel typology of attribution patterns between the field and headquarters that is characterized by synchronized, supplanted or supplemented attributions. A central implication of our study is that, while relevant for strategic change, the internal or external nature of attributions may not be a sufficient condition for that change to take place. Instead, strategic change may be more positively influenced by hybrid attributions in which headquarters combines external attributions from the field with their own internal attributions creating an amalgam that leads not only to more strategic change, but better outcomes from strategic change. Overall, by exploiting the unique features of field data we contribute to the increasingly influential cognitive paradigm in organization theory and strategy by setting forth an elaborated conception of attributions and their relationship to strategic change that extends beyond their traditional view.",strategic change| attribution| adaptation

By that, the noxious co-existence of logics within the organization leads to a competitive advantage which is labeled the paradox of the schizophrenic organization. Illustrating the schizophrenic organization in higher education helps to better understand why the co-existing logics within one organization pose a major problem for this organizations legitimacy as well as for the employed mechanisms.

In our paper, we argue that a modified scenario planning approach has the potential to overcome the discrepancies between the two opposing schools of strategy. Thus, we present a scenario-based approach to strategic planning. This approach builds on the strengths of traditional scenario planning, i.e. its open and creative approach that considers multiple strategy options and takes multiple perspectives into account. Simultaneously, it overcomes the weaknesses of traditional scenario planning by offering a systematic process to scenario creation that is build on specific management tools and thus easy to implement. The outcome of this approach is a core strategy which is complemented by several strategic options that are derived from different scenarios. We illustrate the benefits of this approach on the basis of experiences collected in a consulting project in the German photovoltaic industry.",scenario planning| strategic planning| framework

Berlin||4|Ingo Weller|U. of Munich||,,"In this paper we investigate the influence of ambiguity (as a genuine type of uncertainty) on alliance governance choice. Transaction Cost Economics as well as the Resource Based View (RBV) concur on a positive relationship between ambiguity and hierarchical governance. But, whereas TCE argues that control through hierarchical governance equips firms to better address the contractual hazards arising from ambiguity, resource based researchers argue that hierarchical governance is due to the superior coordination properties within firms. Because both theoretical mechanisms coincide in the same empirical observation, Williamson (2002) has questioned if the RBV offers a useful (and needed) explanation of governance choice. In this paper we disentangle TCE and RBV explanations in the context of alliance governance by examining the mechanisms through which each functions. We introduce a two-dimensional classification of alliance governance forms, along the control (equity vs. non-equity) and coordination (bilateral vs. unilateral) dimensions of alliance governance choice. Using a policy-capturing methodology, we argue and show empirically that ambiguity leads to equity-based alliances, which supports TCE arguments. However, the effect is fully mediated by behavioral uncertainty. In other words, there is no direct effect of ambiguity on the equity dimension. In contrast, we confirm a direct effect of ambiguity on the coordination dimension which supports the RBV argument. The effect is robust in the presence of behavioral uncertainty. In other words, this effect is independent from opportunism. By integrating both types of concerns, our model enables the firms to make more informed and appropriate governance choices.Paper is No Longer Available Online: Please contact the author(s).Upfront and milestone pre-commercialization cash payments and equity investments from incumbents to startups constitute the deal sizes of vertical R&D alliances.

We introduce a theoretical distinction between autonomous and cooperative partnership forms, and develop a framework to analyze these partnership choices under the conditions of environmental uncertainty, market externalities and resource specificity. We then examine the contingent effects of public partner opportunism and stakeholder activism arising asymmetrically under each of the governance forms, and carrying a critical impact upon the private actors   share of value derived from the partnerships, as well as their overall stability and duration. Contrary to the arguments prevailing in the existing literature on significant economic and institutional benefits accruing to the private players from the public sector ties, our work, by drawing simultaneously on transaction cost, public contracting and stakeholder mobilization literature, presents a more complex picture. By linking the previously distinct theories into a dynamic framework, it illustrates how in the context of public-private collaboration, governance, public partners opportunism and stakeholder mobilization all interplay over time to determine the economic and social returns to these engagements and their overall value.",activism| opportunism| performance

We evaluate these hypotheses using a treatment regression model and an original sample of 74 franchise contracts. Analysis of our data broadly supports our hypotheses except for the influence of franchisors reputation. Results suggest that completeness is profitable only when relevant contractual hazards are dealt with.

Arbitration is the most prominent of the ADR mechanisms used for both domestic and international commercial transactions. Despite the rising popularity of arbitration, few studies have examined the factors motivating firms to use the arbitration mechanism in their technology agreements. In particular, empirical research on this issue is surprisingly rare in the strategic management and business economics literature. In this paper, we propose to palliate this important lack of empirical research by studying the trade-off between arbitration and litigation in technology licensing agreements. Given the expertise of the arbitrators, the confidentiality of the arbitral procedure, and the use of idiosyncratic rules, the arbitration mechanism offers numerous advantages when disputes involve technology and IP. However, licensing partners do not systematically decide to include an arbitration provision in their licensing contract. It is therefore important to understand the advantages offered by arbitration but also its drawbacks. To this end, we develop a theoretical framework addressing the trade-off between arbitration and litigation by using as our frame of reference Transaction Cost Economics. We argue that the likelihood that an arbitration provision will be included in a licensing contract increases when the transaction governed by this contract presents high risk of opportunism and great difficulty of writing a complete contract. To test our theoretical framework, we use a database of 118 licensing transactions collected through an online survey launched with the support from the Belgian technology trade association.",arbitration| technology partnership| transaction costs

We suggest that the type of contract framing plays a key role in shaping the development of trust.  Our empirical analysis uses a quasi-experiment to compare promotion-framed versus prevention-framed franchise contracts.  Consistent with our hypotheses, our results indicate that promotion-framed contracts influence more positively trust than prevention-based contracts.

The former is the ability to learn from a specific alliance partner and the latter the ability to learn from diverse partners in a firms alliance portfolio. We propose that compared to general learning capability (GLC), higher partner-specific learning capability (or SLC) relative to its partners suggests that the focal firm is more likely to win the learning race and therefore be rewarded with higher stock returns. Conversely, the greater GLC of the focal firm relative to its partners decreases firm value because the focal firm has little to learn from its partner, but has to bear the cost of knowledge transfer. We also suggest that the alliance governance mode and partners business similarity will have moderating impacts on the relationship between the SLC gap between the partners and returns from alliances because they respectively ameliorate or intensify the potential competition between partners. Results from an event study of over 300 R&D alliances in both the computing and biopharmaceutical industries of the United States support our hypotheses.

The greater asset specificity and interdependence in strongly governed alliances constrain the scope of external capabilities available to the firm and accelerate partner-specific learning, leading to an earlier peak in capability diversity than in portfolios with weakly governed alliances.

(WITHDRAWN),1|Anna Shaojie Cui|Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute||,,"This study examines the interdependencies among individual alliances in an alliance portfolio by looking at whether and how the propensity of termination of one alliance is influenced by other alliances. We contend that competition among alliances stems from the fact that the value of resources in an alliance is dependent upon resources in other alliances of the focal firm as an alliance portfolio aims to access diverse rather than redundant resources and alliances with more valuable resources obtain more support from the firm. On the other hand, synergy is generated by the sharing of alliance management capabilities across alliances with similar characteristics such as wide scope or exploration. An event history analysis is employed with 127 joint ventures over the period 1990 to 2001 to examine alliance termination within a longitudinal dataset. In supportive of competing effects, the survival of an alliance is found to be supported by resource dissimilarity and relative resource complementarity between the focal alliance and other alliances, including both newly formed alliances and other existing alliances in a portfolio. Consistent with synergic effects, alliances that benefit from synergies generated from sharing management capabilities with similar alliances are found less likely to be terminated. These findings provide support for the interdependencies among individual alliances and advance our understanding of alliances at a portfolio level.",alliance termination| alliance portfolio

The purpose of our study is to investigate why firms reveal monetary terms of exploration alliances to external stakeholders.  Disclosing monetary terms of exploration alliances presents the firm with a two edged sword.  On one hand, disclosing monetary terms of an alliance to external stakeholders may signal association with prestigious partners and R&D capabilities.  On the other, disclosure may alert competitors to the size and direction of R&D activities.

We address the question of why firms may not conduct broad search despite its many benefits.  We argue that the costs of broadening search may inhibit exploration and identify two cost-leveraging strategies that can help firms overcome this constraint:  (1) locating some of their activities in foreign countries (offshoring), and (2) joint development with other firms (partnering).  Our model takes into account the costs of search on innovative activities and we find that by applying these cost-leveraging strategies, firms can afford to conduct more exploratory search than if they did not use such strategies.  Moreover, the degree to which offshoring and partnering benefit the firm is likely to be contingent on the firms level of R&D spending, such that firms with lower amounts of R&D spending will enjoy greater benefits from offshoring and partnering than firms with greater amounts of R&D spending.  Hypotheses were tested with longitudinal data from the U.S. pharmaceutical industry.  The main contribution of this research is to show that that firms search behaviors are driven not just what they can do (competencies), but also by what they can afford to do (costs).

In a longitudinal sample of US-based firms engaged in biotechnology product development, we find evidence supporting these hypotheses.  Backward and forward looking search, taken together, explain when firms will be most likely to engage in international alliances, and when firmsa alliance partner portfolios will extend to new countries.

To achieve new forms of ambidexterity, firms may combine their internal learning processes, e.g., exploitation, with the corresponding external processes, e.g., exploration, and vice-versa. We therefore challenge the common assumption that intraorganizational and interorganizational learning can be examined separately. We combine data from a multi-informant survey of 175 industrial firms with patent and financial data to show that the interactions of intraorganizational and interorganizational learning have a stronger positive effect on a firms innovation performance than simultaneous internal exploration and internal exploitation. While the positive effects of all types of ambidexterity are limited under relatively stable conditions, they are particularly pronounced at high levels of industry technological dynamism.

The implicit argument is that experience with an activity improves performance due to enhanced efficiency. It follows then that firms with greater experience will accumulate greater learning. We challenge this idea by suggesting that the repetition of an activity by a firm is an endogenous choice based on its existing capabilities. If a firm possesses certain pre-existing capabilities, it will engage in certain activities corresponding to those capabilities and thereby also achieve superior performance. Consequently, even though an empirical researcher is likely to find an association between experience and performance, it may not be causal in nature. It is possible that this relationship is largely driven by ex-ante capabilities of the firm rather than ex-post learning outcomes. We demonstrate this effect in an international sample of aircraft projects introduced between 1944 and 2000.

During archival research of the business proceedings of Trumpet Records, a 1950s independent record label, we encountered the compelling story of an entrepreneurial leader whose extraordinary integrity and authenticity appeared inconsistent with certain aspects of the principal authentic leadership definitions beginning to converge in the literature. Accordingly, we examined the life and writings of Lillian McMurry, the founder of Trumpet Records, to propose a framework by which leader integrity initiates the conduct and attribution of authentic leadership to transcend charismatic and narcissistic tendencies and diminish the abuse of symbolic status.",management history| authentic leadership| constructive narcissism

In this paper we suggest that experts are not exempt from cognitive bias and their biases can exist in the same direction. When such a situation occurs, aggregating expert biases can lead to an amplified bias as opposed to an elimination of bias.

Such shared understanding tends to decrease, however, when individuals interact with the external environment over the course of the capability development process.

Despite extensive normative guidance, researchers have chronicled a persistent managerial tendency to overestimate their own firms abilities and underestimate competitor firms abilities. As a result, researchers have suggested that managers exhibit a self-serving bias in competitive analysis. This paper suggests a different explanation: managerial learning based on exemplars. Based on fieldwork with seven firms, this paper proposes an exemplar-based model of managerial learning that incorporates social learning and schema theory to explain how managers understand markets and competitors by focusing on an exemplar competitor. By focusing on an exemplar competitor, all subsequent data collection and analysis is framed by the strengths of the exemplar, while the potential strengths of other competitors go unnoticed. This process results in a tautological bias regarding competitive assessment: the best competitor is seen as having the best strategies and this bias tends to grow stronger with experience. Conversely, the strengths of non-exemplar competitors that do not align with the exemplars strengths are underestimated or unnoticed. This tautological bias also explains the apparent self-serving bias and blind spots reported in earlier studies. The authors subsequently find support for exemplar learning and tautological biases in two quasi-experiments using longitudinal interactive business simulations with MBA and EMBA students.",cognition| competition| strategy

Based on complexity theory, this model explores how emotion as an adaptive complex system reacts to organizational affective events through negative and positive feedback loops, and present self-organizing oscillation and transformations between three states: equilibrium emotion, discrete positive and negative emotion in the near-equilibrium state, and chaotic emotion. This model provides a means to linking varied environments and their consequent emotions in a changing process.

Our argument suggests that institutional plurality lead to both complementarities that encourage firms to pay attention to an issue and develop soft strategies such as management incentives, and fragmentation which makes firms more likely to avoid or postpone the adoption of hard strategies that require higher levels of commitment like formal plans. The hypotheses are tested in an empirical analysis of the influences of domestic and foreign institutions on the likelihood that U.S. corporations use soft and hard climate change strategies. While institutions in general increase the likelihood that firms engage in both forms of climate change strategies, we find that firms with experience from both state-level emission targets and the EU Emission Trading Scheme are less likely to develop formal plans than firms with sole experience from one of the two institutional contexts. This finding stresses the value of a contextualized theory of institutional influences which takes into consideration the spatial distribution of institutional pressures and the level of organizational commitment required by different strategic responses. We demonstrate that organizational passivity can be an unintended consequence of situations governed by multiple regulatory initiatives, which each seeks to increase the level of organizational action.",institutional plurality| corporate strategy| climate change

Our findings indicate that while the HR managers note a private position of environmental concern, they are taking a somewhat passive position in relation to environmental sustainability within their organizational contexts.  Concerningly, we also find that while HR managers believe they could play a role in fostering environmental practices within an organization due to their role as stewards of values and as skilled communicators, the form that role could or should take is not well considered.  We note that this passive position is not without potentially adverse effects both in relation to the future role of HR as a strategic partner within organizations and also for the future advancement of environmental sustainability within organizations.

Newman Award Nominee||,"I develop a theoretical framework that identifies how firms influence regulatory policy outcomes through their technological capability profiles. The costs of developing, implementing and enforcing policy increase as the likelihood of compliance by firms diminishes. Regulators balance their public mandate with the costs of regulation, which depend in part on the capabilities of the firms that they oversee. As a result, firms influence policy by their relative ability to comply. I develop a series of empirical predictions that explains how the stringency of state-level environmental policy in the U.S. electric utility industry is determined by the regulator strategically accounting for firms technical ability to manage a diverse fuel portfolio, their financial capacity, and market position. Using a dataset of 144 firms in 48 states between 1991 and 2006, I find that regulators were more likely to adopt aggressive policies when the regulated jurisdiction was simultaneously populated with both (1) technologically capable firms and (2) a single market dominant firm that had the technical and financial capacities to respond in kind. Moreover, when the market dominant firm was a technical laggard the likelihood of a demanding environmental policy was reduced despite the strength of other firms in the jurisdiction. As a result, when firms within a regulated jurisdiction are heterogeneous the regulator can strategically set environmental policy that leads to an asymmetric distribution of costs and benefits. This can have important implications for firm strategy as the incentive for firms to invest to become technological leaders, especially in the case of a dominant firm, may be reduced as they anticipate an onset of more stringent environmental standards in response. Firm strategies that do not incorporate the regulators strategic behavior can be ineffective as they have not taken into account all requisite information.",capabilities| energy| sustainability

Each members contribution may be more or less valuable, to the extent to which such experience and knowledge could help the company better exploit opportunities and reduce environments threats. Therefore, this theory-driven approach suggests that director interlock can make valuable contributions and improve strategic development.

We find support for our predictions that (1) large firms seek symbolic capital through proactive environmental strategy, (2) large firms exhibit a symbolic discrepancy, where the relationship between size and environmental proactivity is stronger for intended environmental strategy statements than for environmental impact mitigation, and (3) the extent to which large firms both seek symbolic capital and maintain symbolic discrepancy is moderated by the extent of monitoring within fields.",proactive environmental strategy| firm size| symbolic capital

Consider that Love Canal has led to one of the most fundamental reforms in environmental protection in the U.S., while other similar events have not led to any comparable change. Organizational institutionalists are ambivalent about the properties of events that trigger change. Some theorists argue that shocking events break the status quo but what constitutes shocking is unclear. Others argue that events do not by themselves cause change. Instead, those who seek change look for events merely as a tool to publicize a problem and recruit support. The central goal of this dissertation therefore is to reconcile the two alternate views by clarifying the specific properties of events that lead to significant institutional change. The findings are intended to contribute to the more effective creation of institutions that promote and enforce sustainability.",environmental policy| institutional change| sustainability

I develop contextualized propositions and conclude that the different institutions selectively and unevenly address the daunting environmental challenge that emerging economies face. Local and global markets tend to effectively prevent the exhaustion of natural resources, but abate pollution only when involving eco-products and multinational companies with universal environmenal standards. Local legislation largely falls short, while global development cooperation addresses only globally salient forms of natural resources and pollution. Local self-regulation tends to be ineffective, while global self-regulation is confined to eco-products and globally relevant issues.

According to our analytical framework trade-offs in corporate sustainability can occur at and between individual, organisational, field and systemic levels and can refer to outcome, process, temporal, and spatial dimensions. We apply the framework to identify and characterise specific trade-offs in corporate sustainability and develop related research questions. Conceptually, a systematic analysis of trade-offs considerably broadens the scope of corporate sustainability and unveils substantial corporate contributions to sustainable development that go unnoticed under the win-win optic.

One of the demands confronting firms and their supply chain members is the deterioration of the earths biosphere and pace at which society is consuming the planets finite resources.  As a result, stakeholders are putting intense pressure on firms to conduct business in ways that promote environmental sustainability.  In todays SCM-intensive business climate, the ability of firms to offer eco-friendly goods and services and do so in environmentally sustainable ways will require the cooperation of the firms supply chain partners, whose supplies (and requisite activities in generating such supplies) can significantly affect the environmental impact of the firms final product.  As a result, there is a growing pressure for firms to integrate more environmentally sound practices into their supply chain activities. Using the logic embodied in the Natural-Resource-Based View (NRBV) of the firm, this paper identifies the types of key resources and capabilities underlying green supply chain management (GSCM) practices for implementing pollution prevention, product stewardship, and sustainable development strategies and then demonstrates why they possess the characteristics of strategic assets and distinctive competencies, respectively, and thus are sources of sustainable competitive advantage.",green supply chain management| the natural resource-based view

As such, the different stakeholders work, and in doing so, compete to shape the future institutional landscape in healthcare. We suggest that it is the entrepreneurial behaviour of key stakeholders that promotes maintenance in subtle yet important ways. The maintenance of institutional arrangements relies on legitimacy claims in which knowledge, power and identity are intertwined. Although institutions may be malleable, we suggest that powerful actors promote institutional maintenance and even buttress power differentials that underpin existing institutions. Specifically, we demonstrate how in a healthcare context, institutions are maintained through, first, institutional work to maintain inter-professional hierarchy, which is based upon legitimacy claims around the management of clinical risk and quality. More significantly, doctors may work to maintain the status quo by highlighting importance of indeterminate knowledge and its impact on jurisdiction, which is accepted by other stakeholders. Second, institutional work to maintain intra-professional hierarchy is based upon an identity claim and ongoing professional projects to lay claim to clinical jurisdiction.",healthcare| institutional theory| insttutional maintenance

Two independent deconstructive readings are performed, one by management scholars schooled in the administrative logic and one by a physician trained in the professional logic. The deconstructions reveal that (i) different logics appear to co-exist when conflict is latent in the deep structures of the field and appear to compete when latent conflict becomes manifest; (ii) conflict is latent when one logic successfully co-opts another through a language of domination; and (iii) conflict becomes manifest when supporters of a logic recognise and recruit the oppositions, contradictions and silences inherent in the language of domination as a source of power.",conflict| deconstruction| institutional logics

We also developed and validated the Rudeness Rationales Scale to assess cognitions that justify behaving rudely towards colleagues. Results supported a three-factor structure, justifying rudeness due to (1) increased pressures, (2) necessary toughness, and (3) excessive sensitivity on behalf of the victim. All three rationales moderated the relationship of supervisor incivility with instigated incivility, such that nurses who employed the rationales reported more instigated incivility when experiencing incivility from others; in contrast, nurses who did not employ the rationales did not report a difference in their instigated incivility between low or high levels of incivility from others.

First, it offers a novel conceptualization of contextual ambidexterity as a two-stage alignment-to-adaptability process and draws linkages to the theory of the Toyota Production System.  Second, it offers preliminary guidance on key characteristics of teams that sponsors should seek, and on the nature of the context they should create.

The instrumental perspective generally treats tangible rewards such as money as a potentially powerful motivator for improving performance when the reward is valued and performance goals are perceived as attainable.  The professional control perspective posits that the motivational effects of financial incentives will depend on how the intended recipients perceive the incentives relative to their professional autonomy and values.  The study setting was a large physician group practice.  We found support for both perspectives.  Physician attitudes regarding the value of the reward and their self-efficacy toward the performance goals were both significantly associated with performance improvement in response to the incentive. Additionally, physician attitudes about the effect of the incentive system in relation to their professional autonomy and the importance of the performance goals were significantly associated with performance improvement.

We theorize how hospital performance is contingent upon network embeddedness, the extent to which a hospital is involved in a network of interconnected inter-organizational relationships.Objective: To explore the effects on hospital performance resulting from both collaborative network ties and competitive relationships between providers.Methods: We used panel data collected between 2003-2007 from 35 hospitals (n=175) in Abruzzo, one of the most populated regions of the central Italy. We use secondary data of hospital activities regarding both clinical and administrative aspects. For each year, we examine the intensity of inter-hospital competition and the unique position each provider has within a larger network of relationships with other hospitals. As well, other idiosyncratic organizational characteristics are examined.Findings: Our results show that hospital productivity is both negatively related to the degree of competition a hospital faces, and positively related to the degree with which hospitals establish collaborative relationships. We also found that the negative impact on hospital productivity due to competitive aggressiveness was lessened when hospitals were more likely to create cooperative network ties.Practice Implications: Because inter-hospital collaboration and competition are related to organizational performance, they should constitute a core element in the strategic planning of a hospitals operation. In particular, health administrators should implement policies that favor collaborative network ties at the regional level, and hospital managers should mitigate the rivalries facing their organizations when establishing collaborative relationships with local competitors.",network ties| hospital performance| inter-hospital rivalry

Explanations for this relationship between focus and firm performance have largely centered on economies of scope achieved by sharing common resources, such as advertising or production capacity, across operating units. We consider whether there are similar benefits to related diversification within an operating unit and examine the mechanism that might generate these benefits. Using data from the hospital industry, we first examine the relationship between focus and clinical performance in cardiovascular care. We find that, on average, focus has at best a weak positive effect on performance. Then, distinguishing between direct and complementary spillovers, we examine: (1) the extent to which a hospitals specialization in areas related to cardiovascular care directly impacts performance in cardiovascular care (direct spillovers) and (2) whether the marginal benefit of a hospitals focus in cardiovascular care depends on the degree to which the hospital co-specializes in related areas (complementary spillovers).

1898,Patient experience|| Patient Safety|| Quality Improvement,2|Patients Discuss Their Roles in Patient Safety,1|Cheryl Rathert|U. of Missouri||2|Nicole Huddleston|U. of Missouri||,,"Patient safety has been one of the most highly researched topics in health care since the year 2000.  One approach for improving patient safety has been to encourage patients to take an active role in their safety during their health care experiences.  Yet little research has shed light on how patients view their roles.  The present study attempts to address this deficit by reporting results of a cross sectional field study in which patients shared ideas about what they believe their roles should be.  Patients with an overnight stay in the previous 90 days at one of three hospitals were surveyed. Qualitative analysis of 491 open-ended responses found several prominent themes.  The largest proportion of responses suggested patients should follow instructions given by care providers.  The second most prominent theme was that patients should ask questions and become informed about their conditions and treatments, but also they should expect competent care.  Several overarching themes indicated that patients want to trust their care providers, as opposed to assuming a leadership role in their safety.  Involving patients in patient safety may be a complex undertaking.  Implications for patient involvement and trust are discussed.",patient perceptions| patient safety

Inconsistent terminology usage in the research literature, conference papers and presentations, and media accounts contribute to widespread misunderstanding and misinformation about patient safety.  Recognition of safety as a system property is integral to improving healthcare.  As such, we view patient safety as a healthcare property that requires conceptual clarification.  The High Reliability Model for Healthcare is presented to illustrate the three domains necessary for organizational improvement efforts to improve patient outcomes.  The three model component, quality management, clinical safety, and patient safety are highlighted in the context of a functional healthcare organization and not as mutually exclusive properties.

This study presents the first empirical evidence of EIs potential to enhance the effectiveness of health IT, findings that should inform policymakers and sectoral actors as they allocate substantial resources toward the healthcare industrys transition from paper-based to electronic recordkeeping.

1899,Information Technology|| Electronic Health Records|| Innovation,2|Understanding and Overcoming the Unintended Adverse Consequences (UACs) of Implementing Health IT,1|Pavani Rangachari|Medical College of Georgia||,,"Numerous studies have identified various unintended adverse consequences (UACs) of implementing health information technology (HIT). For example, UACs identified in the context of implementing Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE) technologies include: unfavorable workflow issues; generation of new types of errors; untoward changes in communication patterns; and problems of paper persistence. However, systematic evidence is lacking in regard to why UACs from HIT implementation occur in healthcare organizations, and how they may be overcome. The literature on technology-in-practice (TIP) emphasizes the role of human agency (or individual action) in enacting structures of technology use (or technologies-in-practice) and other social structures within the organization. Given an identified set of UACs from HIT implementation, the TIP framework can help trace them back to specific actions (i.e., types of HIT-in-practice) and institutional conditions (i.e., social structures). However, insofar as the TIP framework helps understand causes of UACs, it does not shed light on how they may be overcome through strategic management action. To address this gap, this paper integrates the TIP framework with the knowledge-in-practice (KIP) framework. The integrated framework helps understand how information & communication technologies (ICTs) may be utilized alongside existing HIT systems to develop new social structures, create new knowledge-in-practice, and in turn, transform HIT-in-practice. The integrated framework is applied to existing evidence on UACs from CPOE implementation to explain why UACs occur, and how they may be overcome. The application helps develop recommendations for HIT implementation research and practice.",hit implementation| strategic knowledge networks| information & communication technologies

Yet despite a good general understanding of this need, many implementations fall short of expectations, and little is know about effective approaches to implementation in the ambulatory care area.  We aimed to comprehensively study and synthesize best practices for ambulatory EHR system implementation in healthcare organizations, emphasizing strategies that maximize physician adoption and use of EHR systems in practice.  Study Design:  Following an extensive literature review, we held key multiple key informant interviews with representatives of six U.S. healthcare organizations purposely selected based on reported success with ambulatory EHR system implementation.  We also conducted six focus groups with physician providers.  Interviews lasted an average of 60 minutes, and focus groups lasted 90 minutes.  All interviews and focus groups were recorded and transcribed verbatim to permit rigorous qualitative analysis.  	Population Studied:  We interviewed 43 key organizational and clinical informants across the sites.  Key informants included information systems directors, organizational leaders, medical directors and information systems trainers.  Our focus groups were comprised of 34 physician providers including physician residents, attending physicians, and physicians in private practice.  Principal Findings:  While all five sites studied were reported to have strong EHR implementation practices, we were able to characterize good versus great implementation approaches across the sites.  Specifically, good implementation practices included the following nine components: a recognized strategic priority for EHR adoption and implementation; inclusive decision-making processes; preparation for EHR introduction; training; pre-loading of data; focused roll-out; use of provider super-users; availability of information systems (IS) support; and re-training.  However, great implementations had the above nine components with the addition of a tenth key element focused on optimization.  This emphasis on improvement over time helped healthcare organizations make the transition from good to great with respect to EHR adoption and use.  Consistent across all sites and interviews was the notion that improved clinical care/coordination and the enhanced ability to capture data on health care quality metrics were the most compelling reasons to invest in the EHR.  This focus on maximizing the value of the EHR was consistent with our finding about great implementations where a focus on optimization could include considerations of improved data capture and quality of care. Conclusions and Implications:  Our research provides evidence and examples to highlight best practices in ambulatory EHR implementation. These findings have important implications for management researchers studying these organizations, as well as for the organizations hoping to maximize EHR system value.",health care| information technology| innovation

The management philosophy of a firms top manager(s) guides relationships with key constituencies, i.e. customers, competitors, suppliers, etc. Prior research recently suggested the concept of entrepreneurial orientation (EO) as another method by which to understand nursing home managerial philosophy. This study seeks to determine whether or not nursing homes managed by entrepreneurially-oriented administrators experience better financial performance than nursing homes operated by an administrator who is less entrepreneurially oriented. We hypothesized that nursing homes managed by administrators who were more innovative, risk-takers, and proactive would be more likely to have better financial performance than facilities managed by less entrepreneurial administrators. Additionally, research suggested that nursing homes that offered more service innovations and had a chain affiliation would also report better financial performance than were facilities without these characteristics. Data for this study comes from the population of 670 nursing homes in the state of Florida; there were 103 nursing homes in the sample. This data was merged with Medicare Cost Report and the Online Survey Certification and Reporting system data. The overall findings suggest partial support for the hypotheses. Specifically, innovative administrators was negatively associated financial performance, proactive administrators were more likely to have better financial performance than facilities managed by administrators who are less proactive, and facilities who are a part of a multi-facility chain experienced better financial performance than did freestanding facilities. Thus, it is clear that among this sample of nursing homes, those with administrators who are more entrepreneurial are experiencing better financial performance than those managed by nonentrepreneurial administrators.",entrepreneurial orientation| nursing homes| financial performance

Such studies have provided highly contributing theoretical and empirical accounts, approaching organizational phenomena as emerging through the local accommodations of human agents. In particular, the impact this stream has had on the study of technological change has been noteworthy. While shifting focus to practice, performative studies also encompass an appreciation of change as ever-present in organizational life. Nonetheless, they have not yet provided adequate insight on how ever-present change is actually encountered and how it gives way to certain accommodations. This paper addresses this gap by theoretically drawing on the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze and, in specific, his concept of the event. Enacting technological change in organizations is conceptualized as accommodating ceaseless disconcerting events upon a thus far enacted backdrop of significance. Such events are accommodated through various devices, a non-exhaustive list of which is presented in this paper, grounded on ethnographic data. This account concludes with a discussion of the originality or ordinariness of such accommodations and their implications for the trajectory of technological change in organizations.",technological change| disconcerting event| significance

Results revealed that transformational leadership ratings were associated with higher levels of identification by individuals with their team, while this style of leadership also promoted more support for creativity.

Based on a five-year ethnographic case study of a corporate brand building process, the paper elaborates on the ways in which an implementation narrative is co-created in the corporation, through a stream of sense-making and sense-giving activities between the corporate center and the middle management. Furthermore, a number of trans-subjective, socio-historically constructed organizational practices are abstracted from the sense-making and sense-giving activities so as to study the enabling and/or constraining effects of these practices on the internal implementation of the brand and associated strategic change intervention. Overall, the paper contributes to the contemporary research on corporate branding by shedding light on the generative mechanisms and practices that influence the successful implementation of the corporate brand.",corporate branding| strategy-as-practice| sense-making theory

Our research aims to elaborate on the process of transformation. This paper presents a study of health and social care organisations in England.  Our longitudinal, ethnographic case studies document both successful and failed attempts by managers to implement strategic change. Focusing on organizational identification we trace managerial attempts at sensemaking. A complex interaction between managerial organizational identity and the organizational identity of other members shapes organizational sensemaking and mediates strategic change. High levels of both managerial and member organizational identity leads to unsuccessful strategic change. Our findings provide new insights into levels of identification required for achieving strategic change and we discuss sensemaking techniques managers can utilise in achieving these levels across the organisation.",identity| strategic change| sensemaking

This operationalization of the notion of habitus with the individual resource in all its dimensions (social, cultural, economic and symbolic) and its evolution over time is an original approach in the stream of neo-institutionalism. Such a perspective allows an analysis of the individuals microfoundations and their propensity to undertake institutional change without losing sight of the evolution  at a macro-analytical level  of the structure of the field in which these individuals operate. In this respect, we intend to contribute on the one hand to the objectification of the distribution of individual resources (volume and structure of the institutional portfolio) related to processes of institutionalization and, on the other hand, to give a multilevel account of institutional change.",institutional portfolio| habitus| institutional change

This research is based upon an ethnographic field study concerning how middle-managers and frontline staff in two on the surface similar Danish public care organizations respond to the same exogenous institutional pressures to adopt a New Public Management (NPM) based logic of service delivery. The findings illustrate how diverging organizational responses to institutional pressures are shaped by the differential strategies of organization members habitus to handle the practical consequences of such demands.

Such environments can create a need for employees to negotiate humanistic OD values  in which emotional authenticity is valued  with business values.  We contrast employee reports of negotiating emotions through emotional labor with humanistic values and highlight the consequences of such negotiations.  We then analyse outcomes of downplaying negative emotions to highlight the effects of tensions between humanistic and business values experienced during organizational change.  The need to negotiate such tensions arguably provides ethical implications for change practitioners who may create subtle limitations for the potential of OD through implementation of change interventions that are theoretically aligned with humanistic OD values.  We call for greater understanding of such challenges to OD and discussion of ways in which conciliatory approaches between humanistic and business values can be advanced.,od| emotional labor| authenticity

This assumption is so ingrained that broader ways of considering recipients negative responses to change are rarely considered.  In this paper, contrary to starting with the assumption of resistance, we consider the possibility that there are more complete and more appropriate ways of understanding responses to change.  Based on anomalies uncovered in a study of UK senior managers who were recipients of a large scale change initiative in their multinational corporation, we take an abductive approach (Locke, Golden-Biddle & Feldman, 2008) to the development of theory-building about responses to organizational change.  Through iterating back and forth between the data and theory, we have developed a model of responses to organizational change that incorporates shared emotion, and group and intergroup dynamics, including social comparison and group cohesion.  This model makes evident that what appears on the surface as simply  resistance actually encompasses, over time, a number of crucial components that have implications not only for the understanding of change, but also for change agent practice.",resistance| strategic change| organizational change

Such ambiguities can lead to tensions over the ownership and exchange of knowledge within an organization. Much of the analysis of these dynamics is examined from the perspective of the firm in the RBV literature. This paper adds to this field by exploring how fee-earning HR consultants perceive their contribution and standing across these two processes. The primary data drawn from this study reveals that the ownership perceptions held by consultants influence the level and focus of tensions in their relations with colleagues and the organization.

Regardless, the nature of the consulting business virtually assures the impossibility of having a fully billable staff. This paper analyzes one firm's attempt to increase the productivity of non-billable consultants by creating a formalized organizational structure to manage them.  This structure was intended to replace a decade of less formal oversight that leadership ultimately found too disorganized and inefficient. Upon implementation, the new formal structure interfered with numerous longstanding informal processes that had been valuable to the firm's employees. Historically, when junior staff were not able to accumulate billable hours as a reward for work, they were motivated by learning and networking opportunities with senior management. When these opportunities were taken away by a formal structure that separated junior employees from senior management, work quality suffered and conflict increased.  Within six months, the structure slowly dissolved, but it was then reinstated by senior management due to asymmetrical information between junior staff and senior management. This paper contains a descriptive account of this firm's experiment and an explanation of its difficulties using management theory. Finally, using lessons from the firm's experience, I propose more effective strategies to manage unstaffed resources.",management consulting| internal structure| motivation

In this paper we address these questions by analyzing the paths of innovative activities of biotechnology firms. Supporting our prediction based on the behavioral theory of the firm, we find that firms with greater number of individual collaborations (as evidenced by scientific articles co-authored by researchers from different organizations) are more likely to keep close to the locus off innovation in biotechnology. Firms with greater number of strategic alliances and internal collaborations are less likely to do so. We also find that technological specialization negatively affects the match with the future locus of innovation.",alliances| innovation| patent

However, the direction of its evolution, depicted by the change in the technological knowledge sourcing through the different modes, is influenced by the legacies as well as the new environmental contingencies. By illustrating how past and present institutional contexts influence the trajectory of technological knowledge sourcing the study adds insight of a path dependent (historical) contextual antecedent of technology strategy of firms. It also illustrate that different layers of institutional environment of the firms influence firm strategy directly and interactively.

How Feedback in a Community of Consumption stimulates New Media Production,1|Peter Michael Jaeger|ETH Zurich||2|Stefan Haefliger|ETH Zurich||3|Georg von Krogh|ETH Zurich||,,"Virtual online communities and their potential for value co-creation receive increasing interest from both, academia and firms. While communities of production and their contribution to new product development have been widely studied by innovation scholars, less is known about the value creation in communities of consumption that traditionally fall into the domain of marketing research. Considering the overwhelming amount of information generated in an online community and the loyalty and passion consumers show in brand communities, we inductively explore how members of a community of consumption contribute to innovation. To learn more about the feedback behavior of unattended consumers who directly target the producers, we conduct research on a large virtual community of consumption of a Machinima company that produces animated films in video games. A significant number of community members without task assignments provided comments containing specialized feedback that eventually led to product and process innovation and helped the firm maintain the quality of the product. This implies a blurring of the boundary between a community of consumption and a community of production since consumers feedback represents an important step towards learning and, thus, productivity and innovation. Furthermore, we experienced a high signal to noise ratio for meaningful comments calling for an intelligent filtering system to reduce information overload when skimming for innovation relevant ideas.",communities of consumption| consumer co-creation| distributed innovation

Challenges concern the problem of information and idea overload when a large number of users generate content both individually and collectively. Opportunities arise as virtual user communities offer a promising source of creativity outside firm boundaries. In this paper we study to what extent data on user-generated designs and user designers that is readily available in web 2.0 settings can be used to predict the attractiveness of user-generated designs from the perspective of a focal producer firm. Applying multilevel generalized linear modeling, we analyze 1799 designs from 116 user designers in the LEGO user community. We find an inversely U-shaped relationship between the complexity of a user-generated design and its perceived attractiveness. Furthermore, we find a positive relationship between positive feed-back that a given design receives within the peer community and its perceived attractiveness as well as a U-shaped relationship between the intensity of design activities of a certain user designer and the likelihood that his/her designs will be perceived as attractive. Based on these findings we provide implications for theory and management at the interface of marketing and innovation.",communities| new product development| user innovation

""Servitization"" is defined by Vandemerwe and Rada (1988) as offering customer focused packages in order to add value to core corporate offerings.  However, empirical studies of the determinants and impacts of service innovations in manufacturing are very scarce. The purpose of this paper is to examine this innovation strategy. Using the last two waves of the UK Innovation Survey, we first investigate to what extent the determinants of service innovation by manufacturing firms are similar to those of product and/or process innovations. We find service innovation is based on different determinants. We then examine the impact of the different combinations of innovation types on productivity. We find that service innovation tends to impact negatively innovative sales per employee but increases considerably total sales per employee. This suggests that service innovation tends to support or extend existing product offers and increases the throughput of the business, thereby deepening customer connections.",service innovation| manufacturing| performance

This paper shows that, when organizing its upstream R&D activities, the firm also takes into account that external competition in downstream markets potentially erodes the value that collaboration can create, such that collaboration may not be worthwhile. Specifically, we argue that rivals downstream products building on similar knowledge components, by eroding the firms expected value creation from collaboration, will reduce the firms internal upstream R&D collaboration. Further, we argue that such effect of competition is greater when the firm is lacking in technical or commercial abilities. Data from firms sponsoring antihypertensive drugs from 1980 to 2004 support our propositions.

Specifically, we conjecture that competitors that previously allied with a firm can have both positive and negative impact on the firm!-s innovation performance when they race to develop potentially substitutable products. First, former allies are more familiar with the firm and may aggressively exploit such knowledge by blocking some paths essential for the firm to innovate. But the degree of aggressiveness may be constrained by the level of relational capital developed between them in former alliances. Second, prior alliances can also benefit the firm by increasing its absorptive capacity to learn specifically from the innovation output of former allies. Yet, the level of benefit may vary according to the degree of their innovations!- novelty with respect to the firm, which is also influenced by the nature of prior alliances. We tested our theory using a longitudinal dataset, containing 830 rounds of innovation races in the U.S. pharmaceutical industry, over two decades, 1985-2004. Consistent with our predictions, we found that the number of competitors in a race that allied with a firm in strong alliance relationships is associated curvilinearly with the firm!-s innovation performance, taking a U-shape; while the number of competitors that allied with the firm repetitively in weak alliances is associated with the firm!-s innovation performance in an opposite manner, taking an inverted U-shape. The numbers of non-repetitive former weak allies and other competitors in the race were not significantly associated with the firm!-s performance in innovation races. The findings demonstrate the long-term impact of alliance activities on firm performance in competition with former allies. The alliance-history perspective complements traditional view towards alliance activities; it also suggests revisiting an implicit assumption in many strategy studies that competitors relate to a focal firm as if their alliance histories did not matter, thus shedding light on reconciling some important yet inconsistent findings regarding the impact of competition on firm performance.",alliance history| competition| innovation races

Building on existing management and legal literature, we use an interdisciplinary approach to develop a theory of innovation, harm, and information. We contribute detailed conceptions of harm and innovation as well as an information-centric typology for innovation models and detailed explanation of harm. Our paper delineates six (6) propositions that predict the internal and institutional conditions under which firms would make innovation and information decisions that lead to harmful behavior paths and harmful outcomes.

Second, we hypothesize that the time to adoption of functionality-defining technologies is shorter than the time to adoption of substitute technologies. Third, we hypothesize that the time to adoption of technologies introduced by the market leader is shorter than the time to adoption of technologies introduced by other industry members, and that the gap between the two diminishes as the product is more diffused in a market.

We distinguish among two different periods of normative and regulatory state intervention and find that, despite pressures for compliance to state mandates, weak government intervention in the early years pushed universities towards the adoption of spinoff activities based on mimetic behaviors, industry norms and fashion mechanisms. When government regulations and norms were introduced to the higher education industry, the adoption rate collapsed and was now dependent more on efficiency explanations  only universities with strong prior success at spinoff formation were able to continue the process. Our work has implications for institutional and diffusion theories. We show that the rapid, unconditional compliance of public organizations to state mandates that has been previously proposed by diffusion theorists does not hold unless these mandates are closely regulated. As with private corporations, we also find that isomorphic behaviors and fashion diffusion processes are possible among public organizations.",diffusion| fashion| isomorphism

This paper uses literature review, open-ended interviews, and popular press and marketing materials to investigate the role of the U.S. federal government in the shift of innovation focus for Toyota and Lexus to hybrid cars: the Toyota Prius and Lexus RX400H. Findings are presented by moving through each stage of the product development cycle and examining the two cases to ascertain the overall impact of two particular federal government initiatives: the Partnership for New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV) established by the Clinton Administration in 1993 to improve fuel economy and the Alternative Motor Vehicle Tax Credit enacted by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. We propose that the PNGV created competitive pressure to jumpstart hybrid car development and that the tax credit created a market-pull effect.  We find while both initiatives did have some, there are, perhaps, other more significant drivers, e.g.  complementary goods prices and innovator adoption.

Our theory posits that experienced inventors produce a larger number of inventions, but each one of them is less likely to be a breakthrough. The former effect is a natural consequence of the impact of experience on inventive productivity, while the latter effect stems from myopia due to the exploitation of a well established technological path. The net effect of experience on breakthroughs is positive, since path-breaking inventions are largely unpredictable and thus producing many patents is the most effective strategy to achieve them. We first show, through a conditional logistic regression, that experience has a negative effect on whether any given invention is a breakthrough. A negative binomial regression with fixed effect then shows that the rate at which new inventions are produced increases with experience; finally, by using a fixed effect panel logit model, we find that expert inventors are more likely to achieve a breakthrough.

We rely on this organizational arrangement to attempt integration between the transaction-cost perspective and the capabilities-based view because these dominant theories of economic organization are incomplete if viewed independently. Despite high asset specificity and uncertain outcomes these governance structures remain popular among incumbents and persist even after the development of internal capabilities. To resolve the empirical puzzle, we look at the internal organization of incumbents and identify the origins of their innovative capabilities at the individual level. We develop a taxonomy of individuals representing different degrees of individual productivity achieved at varying levels of coordination costs (i.e. relational stars) to emphasize the productive and social aspects of their skills. Conceptualizing innovation as a process of knowledge production and recombination, we hypothesize that incumbents are more likely to enter exploration alliances when they lack sustainable knowledge generation capabilities as reflected on their individuals and that cost economizing operates at the origins of those capabilities constraining the pure capability logic. We show that incumbents boundary choices to govern capability development depend on comparative assessments of internal organization, human resource attributes, capabilities, and coordination costs. Highlighting the role of coordination costs as a component of capability building efforts, we explicate the relationship between internal skills and costs by examining them simultaneously as they leverage each other and co-evolve.",exploration| intrafirm knowledge networks| microfoundations of boundary choices

The paper juxtaposes geographical proximity and triadic closure  i.e. the formation of closed triangles  as two alternative mechanisms in the evolution of networks. It argues that the role of both mechanisms is subject to change over time as the technological regime of an industry changes. More precisely, the paper proposes that geographical proximity between inventors is mostly relevant for tie formation in the early stage of the industry, when knowledge is predominantly tacit. By contrast, the closed triangles as produced by triadic closure act as vehicles of trust gaining relevance once the industry gets more established, with higher levels of knowledge codification and the associated risk of unintended and costly knowledge leakages. These trends are empirically tested taking biotechnology in Germany as an example of an evolving, spatially agglomerated knowledge-intensive industry. On the basis of a patent-based reconstruction of the inventor network and a stochastic estimation model of network evolution, the study confirms that geographical proximity becomes less important and triadic closure more important over time as a determinant of tie formation.",network dynamics| geographical proximity| biotechnology

Conversely, scholars in entrepreneurship have mainly aimed at understanding how firm level factors such as network position and start-up team composition affects their start-up performance. Despite the efforts made in both the fields of technology management and entrepreneurship, few studies have included both views from technology management and entrepreneurship to understand the successful commercialization of new high technology products.

We apply the transaction cost economics and knowledge-based perspective to examine the payment schemes of international license-in. As payment schemes are outcome of negotiation, we hypothesize that knowledge proprietariness and internalization hazards are associated with the choice of payment scheme. We characterized knowledge proprietariness in terms of tacitness and systemic shift, and internalization hazards arising from of recipient transfer capacity and horizontal competitiveness. Based on a survey of Taiwanese 73 firms in ICT and biomedical industries, we find transaction cost perspective and knowledge-based view provide useful insights into the choice of licensing payment schemes. The results suggest that the more proportioned royalties payment is positively associated with recipient learning capability and quality of recipient transfer capacity, but is negatively associated with tacitness, systemic shift, and licensor opportunism. These findings suggest that future research should examine a variety of licensing as well as payment schemes, investigate detailed knowledge proprietariness characteristics and pay more attentions to knowledge-accessing and the quality of intelligence management in NIEs.",inward international technology licensing| internalization hazard| knowledge proprietariness

We use the U.S. defense industry as a setting to investigate how varying customer and technology portfolio configurations shape the differential performance of firms after an exogenous industry shock. Our dataset aggregates contract level data for all firms in this industry from 1996 to 2006, and our results point to differential post-shock firm performance implications resulting from varying pre-shock choices around customer and technology scope.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether for service firms, the question of ambidexterity is as important as it is for manufacturing firms, and whether there are differences in the way a balance between exploration and exploitation is achieved. Drawing on longitudinal data of the Belgian Community Innovation Survey and the bel-first database, we examine 532 firms. Results show that both ambidexterity and punctuated equilibrium have a positive effect on firm performance growth. Furthermore, there is a significant difference in innovation behavior between service firms and manufacturing firms, whereby manufacturing firms are more likely to use the ambidexterity model and service firms the punctuated equilibrium model. As the positive effect on financial performance did not explain the difference in the use of various methods to achieve ambidexterity, we performed multiple case study research to understand indepth the drivers why service firms prefer the punctuated equilibrium over the simultaneous ambidexterity model.

Building on the competence and contractual perspectives, we argue that the combination of exploration and exploitation engenders also synergies.

Based upon a sample of 149 alliances which involve European academic spin-offs, our results suggest that, in spite of the alleged tensions between exploration and exploitation, ambidextrous alliances never result in inferior output than alliances specialized in either exploration or exploitation and that they are particularly relevant for product and strategic innovation.",alliances| innovation| ambidexterity

It is claimed that firms need to search for innovation inputs from a range of different external sources. However, the question where to search for innovation inputs to improve a firms innovation performance has hardly been tackled. In addition, empirical evidence for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is limited. This paper explores innovation search strategies of European SMEs. It also examines how a firms external-oriented innovation strategy affects the value creation throughout the innovation value chain and how it interplays with internal innovation management practices and routines in explaining a firms performance. To do so, we first explore the innovation search patterns and derive a taxonomy of five different innovation search types. To better guide managerial investments decision relatedto external search and collaboration, we examine the determining haracter of six directions of innovation search and three aspects of collaborative innovation. In addition, we model formal and embedded innovation management practices as mediating factors. The empirical study is based on a sample of 1,448 SMEs from both manufacturing and service industries. We identified significant effects of the direction of search and collaborative innovation on the innovation value chain output.

However, the important role of complementarities and substitutabilities among resources has long been stressed by strategic management theory. Addressing this gap, we study interaction effects between product-related patents and three other important appropriability mechanisms, namely, lead time, the overall patent portfolio, and openness in the sense of contributions to open standards. To this end, we conducted discrete choice experiments with 319 employees in various functions of a leading communications equipment firm. Using mixed logit regression models, we can support most of our hypotheses regarding complementary and substitutive relationships between appropriability mechanisms.

Earlier research has stated substantial validity concerns regarding the evidence underlying AC measurement in the past. Our AC construct wants to overcome these shortcomings. Our research demonstrates that an organizations AC is higher when its members are supported by dedicated coordination instruments facilitating the learning from external experts. Using a covariance-based structural equation modeling approach, we analyze primary data from 330 respondents of a multi-informant survey. We find that informal communication with external experts, boundary spanning teams, absorption-oriented incentive systems, and open-mindedness are important organizational antecedents of AC. Contrary to the earlier conceptual literature, we find only little support for a positive effect of internal communication on absorptive capacity. In this regard we emphasize the importance of considering the type of external knowledge that shall be absorbed. Our results show that the successful transfer of technological, implicit knowledge asks for a different coordination system than the absorption of rather explicit knowledge.

Viewing the Open Source Risk Management (OSRM) report in 2004 as an unexpected patent threat (shock) to OSS-based business models, we interpret the named firms patent pledges as strategic reactions aimed at ameliorating their surrounding appropriability regime. Pledges both (a) enabled the coordination among OSS-centric firms on risk-free exploitation of OSS using complementary assets and (b) created norms for patent non-enforcement against OSS users more broadly. Patent purchases from third parties stabilize the coordination arrangement against disturbances from outsiders. Tracing product and patent data for OSS-centric firms and closed innovators before and after the shock (20002008), we find empirical evidence supporting our allegations.

Drawing on the Guidance of Knowledge Spillover Recipient Firms to Expand Knowledge Boundaries,1|Hongyan Yang|Hong Kong Polytechnic U.||,,"Exploring new technological domains can enable a firm to reposition and cushion itself against the uncertainty associated with intense competition, fluctuating demand, and limited industry growth. However, exploring new knowledge domains beyond ones existing expertise is also challenging and fraught with uncertainty. A firms appetite for the inherent uncertainty of exploring new domains may be limited in an already uncertain environment.To reconcile this dilemma, firms can explore new and unfamiliar domains by mimicking other firms that have borrowed knowledge originally created by the exploring firm. Recipient firms often combine the originating firms knowledge with knowledge outside of the originating firms areas of expertise. In doing so, these recipient firms provide insight to the originating firm regarding the viability of exploring such new knowledge. By mimicking their recipient firms, the challenge and uncertainty of exploring these new knowledge domains is reduced for the originating firm. We examine the exploration activities of 87 telecommunications equipment manufacturers over a 10-year time period. We argue that those firms that operate in competitive and dynamic market environments will more highly value such uncertainty reduction and rely to a greater extent on recipient firms for guidance as to where to explore for new expertise. Whereas firms in munificent, high-growth market environments are more likely to look beyond the activities of recipient firms when exploring new technological domains and rely less on mimicry.",spillovers| exploration| imitation

Newman Award Nominee||,"This paper develops the argument that organizations avert obsolescence through the continuous accumulation of small changes over time, such as changes resulting from inbound mobility of people.  By leading to a change in the composition of knowledge and to routine in organizations, inbound mobility results in lower path dependence and greater technological experimentation, both indications of lower inertia. As a consequence, the impact and influence of innovations created by an organization increases. Analysis reveals a particularly strong effect of inbound mobility on innovation impact in the case of more inert organizations, such as older firms, rather than for younger organizations, supporting the thesis that inbound mobility helps to avert obsolescence.  In line with this argument, the data reveal that the composition of technologies core to biotechnology firms changes over time, indicating that firms may effectuate major changes to their strategy and structure through the accumulation of small changes.  To validate these claims, I study mobility and change in the context of patenting in the U.S. and Canadian biotechnology industry over a period of 38 years from 1970-2007.",mobility| inertia| obsolescence

In this paper, we examine how a firms institutional capital may moderate the relationship between its innovation and sales performance.  In particular, we hypothesize that the moderating effect of investment in institutional capital is likely to vary with the type of innovation activities: when a firm is pursuing explorative innovation that faces high regulatory uncertainties, investment in institutional capital is expected to have a positive moderation effect on sales performance; but when the firms innovation activities are largely of a routine, exploitative nature, investment in institutional capital is likely to be wasteful, resulting in a negative moderating effect.  Using data from a survey of 1500 manufacturing firms in China, we provide empirical support for the above hypotheses.  Overall, our findings contribute to both the IBV and innovation strategy literature by providing a better understanding of the interdependent relationship between investment in institutional capital and innovation.",exploration and exploitation| institutional capital| china

We make use of the cross-sectional and time-series variation of legal enforcement of CNCs across states in the U.S., and document that firms located in states with high level of enforceability of such contractual agreements tend to engage less in innovation activities in terms of fewer patent applications. We examine the quality of innovation based on patent forward citations, and document similar finding that higher enforcement of CNCs is associated with less innovative patents. We further examine the moderating effects of industry concentration and managerial compensation on the relation between firm innovation and state enforcement of CNCs.

A pre-product standard, based on a modular, nearly decomposable design, evolves via a concatenation of an elementary three-stage process: a search trigger, selection and elaboration of technological principles resulting in the standard, and standard as retention mechanism. This process leads to simultaneous rather than sequential introduction of innovation types, increases the technological systems performance continuously, and results in a life spiral model. The standard-developing organization, an inter-firm organizational architecture, with certain governance, structure, and procedures provides the required coordination among the manufactures, service providers and other players.

We disentangle the underlying mechanisms and find that the shift towards vertical integration is driven by reduced benefits of discovery while the shift towards outsourcing is driven by reduced costs of divergence.,vertical integration| outsourcing| technological change

Yet evidence supporting this received wisdom remains largely anecdotal.  Using U.S. patent citation data, I find strong empirical evidence that firm headquarters are indeed better able to access remote knowledge when they have subsidiaries in the remote location.  In particular, a firm in location ""A"" cites third-party patents from location ""B"" disproportionately (relative to a control group also in location ""A"") when the firm has an R&D satellite in location ""B"".  This ""satellite effect"" on knowledge diffusion is economically significant, representing 47% of the knowledge flow premium associated with collocation.  Furthermore, the effect is particularly strong for new knowledge as well as in areas of satellite technological specialization, suggesting that firms can target cutting-edge knowledge in specific sectors.

This suggests that companies that compensate for the suppressing effect of organizational loose coupling on cooperativeness and their ability to coordinate collaborative innovation will maximize innovation performance. We examined the compensating effect of dominant product design rules for organizational loose coupling and found that this effect is significantly related to product innovation performance.

Magee|Massachusetts Institute of Technology||,,"Hierarchy is a generic structure in which levels are asymmetrically ordered. In an industry setting, classic supply chains display strict hierarchy, whereas clusters of firms have linkages going in many different directions. Previous theory has often assumed the existence of the hierarchical relationships among firms and empirical work has focused on a single level of an industry or bilateral relationships. However, quantitative evidence on the hierarchy in large industrial sectors is lacking. In this paper, we develop metrics and methods to define and measure the degree of hierarchy in transactional relationships among firms, and apply the methods to two sectors in Japan: automotive and electronics. We compiled the networks of firms connected by transactional relationships. Our empirical analysis shows that the electronics sector exhibits a lower degree of hierarchy than the automotive sector due to the wide existence of transaction cycles. We further analyze the differences in hierarchy using a simulation model based on transaction breadth and transaction specificity. The empirical measurement and model analysis together indicate that it is the low transaction specificity that drives down the degree of hierarchy in the electronics sector. Further analysis shows the difference in transaction patterns in turn may result from the differences in the power level of underlying technologies, which affect product modularity, asset specificity, innovation dynamics and firm behaviors. Thus, the degree of hierarchy in an industry sector may be traced back to fundamental properties of the underlying technologies.",industry architecture| networks| hierarchy

The dynamics of how such core-periphery structures evolve and become embedded in a firms innovation routines has been shown to be a major factor in predicting survival, especially in turbulent technology-based industries.  To date however, there has been little empirical evidence on the propensity with which core-periphery structures are observed in practice, the factors that explain differences in the design of such structures, or the manner in which these structures evolve over time.We address this gap by analyzing a large number of systems in the software industry.  Our sample includes 1,286 software releases taken from 19 distinct applications.  We find that 75-80% of systems possess a core-periphery structure.  However, the number of core components varies widely, even for systems that perform the same function.  These differences appear to be associated with different models of development  open, distributed organizations developing systems with smaller cores.  We find that core components are often dispersed throughout a system, making their detection and management difficult for a system architect.  And we show that systems evolve in different ways  in some, the core is stable, whereas in others, it grows in proportion to the system, challenging the ability of an architect to understand all possible component interactions.

However, partial least squares (PLS) is a better alternative technique under certain circumstances, for example, when assumptions for CBE are not met.In this paper we propose a research framework for the complementary use of PLS in SEM studies.  We first highlight the advantages of PLS to operations management research through a comparison of PLS and CBE.  Then we identify four research design factors to classify different types of SEM studies.  Next we provide guidelines for the appropriate design and execution of each type of studies so that methodological rigor can be maintained.  Finally and most importantly, we present a research roadmap for the complementary use of PLS and CBE in SEM studies.

This research utilizes TCT and RBV theories to explore outsourcing decisions, processes and experiences of new biotechnology firms. Case studies of ten start-ups and twenty of their suppliers provide evidence and rationale for outsourcing a variety of value chain activities. Our findings show that new firms outsourcing to highly-embedded suppliers are likely to secure access to a wider supplier network at favorable terms, attain best-in-class operational knowledge, avoid supplier opportunism but face low levels of relationship-specific investments unless they have suppliers with a vested interest. Firms outsourcing to suppliers at the network periphery are more likely to realize cost efficiencies, expose themselves to opportunism, uncertainty and higher levels of relationship-specific investments but low levels of operational know-how specific to the new firms operation. New firms with technical, evaluation, relational, entrepreneurial and integration competencies are more likely to benefit from outsourcing in networks. We point out that new firms develop contractual and operating safeguards to protect themselves from supplier opportunism. We conclude by discussion implications for theory and offering suggestions for future research and guidelines for managing multiple outsourcing relationships.",start-ups| supplier networks| outsourcing

The positive implications may include cost savings and more attractive offerings to customers.  On the suppliers side, collaboration during the new product development (NPD) process may lead to a faster and more efficient process.  On the users or customers side, collaboration may provide ideas for entirely new products and/or modifications to existing ones.  In this paper, we examine how collaboration with suppliers and a group of users that experience needs unknown to the public, the so-called lead users, affects the resulting variety of the products offered.  We focused on product variety because of its increasing perceived importance in the satisfaction of changing customer needs.  Hierarchical regression analysis of survey data collected from 313 UK manufacturers revealed a significant positive relationship between collaboration and product variety. Our key findings are that increasing the level of collaboration with lead users and with suppliers during the new product development process will increase the variety of product offered to customers, and that lead users have a higher impact on product variety to suppliers.",product variety| new product development| supplier collaboration

The concept of response capacity assumes that the organizational structure which emerges during project execution includes some aspects that planners overlook, others that are more complex than expected, as well as some relations and routines of which participants have only marginal awareness.  Because of these differences, emerging structures shape the reaction to unexpected events in ways that deviate from the anticipations included in the plan. The theoretical framework identifies the key aspects of planning that influence the emerging structure, and highlights the properties of this structure, namely the cohesion, flexibility and resourcefulness which form it response capacity and condition the reaction to unexpected events. The paper discusses six case studies of complex projects from three different domains and makes three specific contributions to our understanding of these processes. First, it advances theory by scrutinizing the relevance of postulated processes, properties and variables. Second, it identifies typical patterns of relations between these factors, and compares them with theoretically anticipated influences. Third, it suggests tentative explanations of these patterns in terms of invariant influence trajectories that tie together context, planning, structures, events, reactions and performance. These contributions not only advance the response capacity theory and help derive practical implications from it, but also provide useful insights for the organizational structuration and dynamic capabilities theories.",project| flexibility| event

The specificity of project management in different contexts is recognized, but an empirical contingent approach is long overdue. This paper is based on an empirical investigation of project management practice. Clusters of experienced practitioners are identified from their levels of use of empirically identified toolsets. Practice is investigated through the study of the extent of use of a large number of practices, tools and techniques specific to project management. A sub-sample of 1,296 practitioners from widely diverse backgrounds participating to a large scale international survey is used for this paper. Contextualized project management practice archetypes are identified; original models of practice after which other similarly contextualised practices are patterned. The results empirically confirm some well-known assumptions about practices, but also sharpen the knowledge and understanding of practice in real complex multidimensional contexts by presenting specific patterns of practice for each cluster. The interplay of maturity, innovation, project definition and success or the combination of external, private engineering matrix organisation, together with their associated patterns of practice constitute examples of contextualised archetypes of practice that provide rich but complex specimens of real practice. The archetypes are therefore potentially useful as a tool to understand, to reflect upon or to teach project management.",project management| practice| cluster

Drawing empirically from the PS4bn Terminal 5 project to expand Londons Heathrow airport, we propose a conceptualization of design freeze postponement to accommodate evolution in customer requirements contingent upon flexibility built into product design. Front-end strategizing, coupled with modular architectures or safeguarded integral architectures, enable the early freezing of some design elements whilst keeping others fluid with minimal risk of costly rework. To be effective, this approach requires a high degree of knowledge sharing. It also requires both an ability and willingness of the project partners to engage in long-term visioning, and invest accordingly. We show that this is often inadequate. Consequently, developers need to manage the risk of late changes. Ultimately, design flexibility and project risk management are found to be complements, not substitutes, with the balance between them hard to determine ex ante.",design flexibility| project management| uncertainty and complexity

This study is rooted in institutional theory to formulate a number of propositions about contextual factors. First, we develop and empirically test a structural equation modeling (SEM) model of the influence of purchasing maturity to both operational performances and to business profitability. Purchasing maturity comprises four strategic PSM practices, supplier management, performance management, talent management, and cross-functional integration. The operational performances measure PSMs contribution to cost reductions, quality improvements, and innovation. Second, we analyze the influence of three contextual factors industry sector, degree of centralization, and reporting level of the chief purchasing officer (CPO) on the implemented level of purchasing maturity and its relationship on performance. This study combines multiple data sources, from telephone interviews, questionnaires, and objective financial data collected from a global, cross-industry sample of 306 major companies. Our results confirm that a sophisticated purchasing maturity has a positive impact on operational performance as well as an indirect positive effect on business profitability. Furthermore, the results indicate that both the implementation of purchasing maturity and its relationship on performance are to some degree context-dependent.

On the one hand, fostering social capital improves a buying firms ability to leverage resources available within a BSR. On the other hand, if taken to extreme, it can reduce the buying firms ability to be objective and make effective decisions as well as increase its suppliers opportunistic behavior. There should be an inflection point in which the benefits and the risks of social capital equal; although to achieve said threshold depends whether the buyer and supplier work to promote radical, innovative changes compared to whether they foster incremental, operative changes.

This study researches the effect of culture in contractual buyer supplier agreements using transaction cost as a theoretic lens. A large number of relationships translate into contracts between partners, but very few studies have investigated the effect of cultural differences on these written agreements. Contracts are adjusted based on the needs and requirements of specific partners in the relationship. The current study takes contractual data from a European multinational company and investigates the impact of culture on buyer-supplier relationships using Hofstedes four culture dimensions: power distance, masculinity, individuality and uncertainty avoidance. The main finding is that contract completeness increases as the cultural gap between the buyer and supplier widens. The results for individual culture dimensions, measured cumulatively per buyer-supplier pair, are mixed. Finally, asset specificity has the expected positive effect on the level of contract completeness, while more frequent transactions result in lower levels of contract completeness. This implies that cultural background is a factor in contractual buyer supplier relationships and need to be taken into account in global supply chain management.",buyer-supplier relationship| culture| contracts

Servitization is a business model innovation whereby a manufacturer of products provides more encompassing solutions by offering product-related services. Despite the opportunity servitization offers to create value, recent case studies indicate that adopting a servitization strategy might encounter considerable implementation problems  resulting even in a negative impact on performance.  Although there is a consensus that this service paradox can be solved by adopting adequate organizational arrangements and managerial practices, there is a lack of agreement on the exact nature of such arrangements and practices to be effective. Within this paper, we want to contribute to our understanding on how to organize servitisation effectively.  We engage in an extensive case study research of a manufacturing firm that has been able to create and retain value from services. Findings from 10 contrasting case studies of sales-and-service subsidiaries of the firm under study lead us to conclude that, in order for servitization to be implemented successfully, products and services need to be organized as a partnership of equals.  This implies dedicated senior management commitment towards services, the presence of service specific objectives as well as the consequent translation towards operational targets and incentive systems. A strict separation of product and service activities does not appear as a necessary condition to be effective. This latter observation stems directly from the integration requirements necessary to create value  by offering both product and services  for customers.",service effectiveness| servitization

It is claimed that corporate advantages can accrue from such an involvement and that this affiliation facilitates the achievement of strategic purchasing objectives. However, empirical evidence concerning the benefits of purchasing involvement is limited and the question of how to develop effective intra-organizational relationships remains unanswered. This paper draws from the experience of sales organizations and the concept of key account management (KAM) to argue that the purchasing function should apply internal key account management (IKAM) methods. The term internal key account management refers to the practice of actively managing internal customer relationships and fostering an internal customer orientation, based on the segmentation of internal customers. This paper describes a conceptual model, which represents diverse options faced by purchasing while implementing an IKAM program. The results of an empirical study are then presented and provide evidence that IKAM positively impacts the purchasing functions relationships and integration with internal key customers, and its business performance. A key finding of the study is that company size is highly relevant for the performance of the individual IKAM design elements. It is shown that IKAM has the strongest impact on performance in medium-sized firms.",purchasing| intra-organizational relationships| performance

The current study integrates both approaches, by using the MM-IRT model in which covariates (i.e., observed characteristics) are modeled in conjunction with LCs (MM-IRT-C). This approach is a generalization for detecting ME attributable to observed and/or unobserved groupings simultaneously: (a) it can be used to ascertain ME over multiple observed characteristics (categorical and/or continuous) concomitantly; (b) underlying latent measurement classes can be inferred, and LC membership can be associated with observed characteristics; (c) determining if latent traits are related differentially to covariates across LCs; (d) determining if observed ME occurs for a specific subgroup of individuals after taking into account latent measurement classes. This method is illustrated using a measure of union citizenship behavior, with gender and years of work experience as covariates.

Yet, what makes organizations unique and environments distinct while accounting for the exemplar environment-organization fit? It is in this context that I present a research methodology that allows exploring the unfolding of organizations-environment as a geographically bound, time evolving, co-constructed occurrence. In this paper, I use as an exemplar the organizing of a creative class in a former mill town in Western Massachusetts to explore one instance of the organizations-environment process. To achieve this goal I advance as a research methodology a case study that is derived from a multi-method approach including participatory ethnography and social network analyses where quantitative and qualitative data functions in a complementary way. Participatory ethnography explores and contextualizes the relationships among socioeconomic agents and their organizing attempts to become members of the community, and to (un)purposefully shape their locality-environment. Social network analyses maps and articulates the recurring patterns of interactions among the various socioeconomic agents. The resulting case study presents a narrative of local emancipation fueled by a dynamic bottom-up organizations-environment co-constructing phenomenon whose socioeconomic consequences cannot be guaranteed by formal planning.",social processes| ethnography| social networks

This paper reviews the properties of mental models which have been measured by existing approaches. It shows that these methods lack to account for relevant aspects of dynamic systems, such as, time delays in causal links, feedback structures, and the polarities of feedback loops. The elicitation of mental model with only those properties yields mostly static models. To overcome them, we enhance the distance ratio approach (Markoczy and Goldberg, 1995) so as to comprehend these characteristics and detect differenced among mental models at three levels: the level of elements, the level of individual feedback loops, and the level of the complete model. An application of the method shows that this previously non-existent information is essential for understanding differences in mental models of managers. The method opens up a path to elaborate the models managers use in real world decision making. We discuss the benefits and limitations of our approach and conclude by identifying directions for further research.",mental models| systems thinking| managerial cognition

The data set of this study includes daily opening, high, low, and closing prices, and daily volumes of component stocks in the Taiwan Top 50 Tracker Fund between 2002 and 2008.The results of this paper indicate that the bullish reversal patterns are more profitable than bearish reversal patterns. Furthermore, the piercing pattern is one of the best strategies of those tested in this paper for investors in the Taiwan stock market. The main contribution of this study is considering the profitability of candlestick trading strategies from a long-term perspective by buying on bullish patterns and holding until bearish patterns occurred.

Applications for multivariate normal processes are becoming more popular though there is paucity for non-normal approaches. The intention of this paper is to develop new tools for measuring and controlling the dependence/correlation structure for complex non normal data sets.There are different ways to control variability and dependence structure, but one of the simplest ways is by means of the use of multivariate statistical process control. When variability is caused by different variables that may be correlated, multivariate control charts come to the rescue. The usual multivariate charts consider mostly the situation when the data come from a multivariate normal distribution.  In practice fatter tails in the univariate histograms may be also present. In this paper, we develop control charts for the dependence of very complex systems based on Information Theory.  The entropy and dependence functions are used to develop control charts for the multivariate t distribution and Cauchy.  Practical application includes analysis for multivariate financial and quality control data.Keywords: multivariate statistical process control, control charts, fat tails, dispersion, entropy, mutual information, multivariate t distribution.",six sigma| quality control charts| information theory

Journal articles are among if not the most important aspect of a scholars academic portfolio. Traditional evaluation of articles has been centered around the volume of productivity and the impact of the outlet in which they appears. The influence of scholarship has generally been inferred based on the outlet in which a work appears. This is problematic as numerous prior studies indicate journal impact is a poor proxy of the influence of individual articles. We proxy influence using citation counts and assess longitudinal trends for individual articles from leading management journals. Our results suggest early citations counts can be used as a predictor of the long-term influence of individual articles. We find only a short time period following article publication is sufficient to predict long-term influence. Delayed recognition, characterized as low initial citations followed by significant later citations, causes limited instability in predicting long-term influence.

This represents an inclusive portrait of a research area that can counteract biased judgments based on limited information.  An opportunity analysis finds theoretical and methodological characteristics from one perspective that could be profitably employed in another perspective.  A pattern analysis, by investigating whether each perspective contains a core theory, indicates most researchers starting point for model construction.  These analyses become the basis for recommending important under-utilized features to researchers from each perspective and for suggesting learning that one perspectives researchers can obtain from the others.

However, most methods adopted for mediational analysis are designed for simple models containing only one mediator, a weakness which has led to a limited number of recommendations regarding the methods that can be used for testing and comparing specific mediation effects in complex latent variable models.  Following the recommendation consistently made in the literature that the BC bootstrap approach be adopted for mediational analysis, this study first demonstrates a procedure in which PRELIS, LISREL, and Microsoft Office Excel are used to construct a BC bootstrap confidence interval for a specific mediation effect in a multiple mediator model consisting of latent variables.  Based on this procedure, we then demonstrate how to construct a BC bootstrap confidence interval for the difference between two specific mediation effects (i.e. DM).  These two procedures outperform the methods proposed in the extant literature in that they are not restricted by the normality assumption and can easily be applied to any specific mediation effect in any mediational model.  These procedures thus provide researchers with a statistical tool enabling them not only to examine whether a particular mediated path is statistically significant, but also to assess whether one mediator is stronger than another.",mediation| complex latent variable models| lisrel

Contrary to these findings, empirical data from an ES adaptation in a Scandinavian high-tech company, SCANDI, shows how the system was highly integrated, accepted by its users, and well-aligned to the work processes. This leads to the research question: Why is the enterprise system so well-adapted in SCANDI and what can we learn from this case study? Building on the structural model of technology to investigate the institutional logics and the sensemaking processes at play, we present three sets of reasons for the successful adaptation that relate to: 1) The institutional properties where a rationalized myth about effective work practices and an efficient ES travels from a national to a local level; 2) The nature of the enterprise system with a long transition process from match to current business processes towards match to standard package; and 3) The human actors enactment of the ES in practice where existing structures are reinforced. We point to the process of customizing and then un-customizing the system as well as a long-term institutionalization and legitimization course of events leading to secondary socialization as the key lessons learned in achieving successful ES adaptations.",enterprise system adaptation| institutional logics| sensemaking

Understanding motivation for continued participation in online communities is an understudied area of research with practical relevance. We propose that continued participation in online communities is a multi-dimensional construct. To investigate individual-level and online community-level antecedents of two dimensions of continued participation, participation continuance intentions and participation intensity intentions, we analyze 535 survey responses and communication history of 135,477 messages from members of 33 different online communities. Our cross-level analysis furthers the understanding of the relationship between interaction with online community leadership, psychological safety, participation continuance intentions and participation intensity intentions. This study provides support for the proposition that participation intentions in online communities is a multi-dimensional construct. Further, we find evidence that online community psychological safety is both a contextual factor influenced by online community leadership as well as an influence on individual participation intentions. The findings demonstrate the importance of a multi-level approach to studying online community participation.

Online reverse auctions thus provide fertile ground for the study of ethical issues in virtual settings, particularly as there has been little investigation of these issues by the IS community. We adopted a qualitative approach based on a narrative study of a major French retailer and its suppliers. We held seventy interviews with three groups of informants (technology initiators, buyers and suppliers) to explore how these actors interpret and deal with the unethical use of the technology.

Decades of research on diversity in offline work groups, however, has painted an inconclusive picture. The optimistic argues a broader range of insights from a diverse group can lead to improved outcomes whereas the pessimistic argues individual differences can lead to conflict and diminished performance.  In this paper, we examine the effects of group diversity on the amount of work accomplished and on member withdrawal behaviors in WikiProjects collaboration. We find that increased tenure diversity improves both productivity and member retention  up to a point. Beyond that point, group productivity remains high, but members are more likely to withdraw. Strikingly, no such diminishing returns property was observed for interest diversity, which also improves both productivity and member retention.

It broadly proposes two dimensions of user trust in VWs as trust in virtual world community (VWC) and trust in virtual world platform (VWP) which are further subdivided as party trust and control trust. Further, the moderating roles of individual traits on user trust are also studied to understand the role of individual differences for EUI of VWs for collaborations. The proposed model is tested via data collected from VW users in Singapore. Results demonstrate the importance of control trust for using VWs as a collaborative tool.

Most importantly, the analysis results clearly show that common identity is the primary driver for user behaviors in online communities. In contrast, common bond attachment has only a rather limited influence.

To investigate this question, 416 raters viewed an interview transcript that was accompanied by either a male or female avatar, applying for either a traditionally male or traditionally female job. We found that candidates whose avatars were more attractive were judged to have performed better in the interview, regardless of gender or job gender type. Attractive avatars were also more likely to be recommended for further consideration. Further, we found that these effects were mediated by perceptions of fit.

We propose that centralized IS infrastructures help resolving task exceptions in production processes that are characterized by high requisite integration, that is, processes where highly differentiated business functions are tightly interdependent. Conversely, we propose that in production processes with low requisite integration, decentralized IS infrastructures facilitate resolving task exceptions.

While scholars have examined how important contextual factors, such as psychological safety, issue importance and leadership, influence individuals willingness to speak up within their organizations, relatively little research has examined the underlying cognitive mechanisms driving this behavior (Chiaburu, Marinova, & Van Dyne, 2008).  In this paper, we propose a two-stage cognitive process model that individuals use when determining how to speak up, once they have already decided that they want to speak up.  Specifically, we offer theoretical insight into four distinct communication approaches available to individuals who possess the desire and intent to voice  reframing, direct, powerless speech and humor.  Drawing from the well-established humor, impression management and issue-selling literatures, we suggest that using humor is the best approach for individuals who want to voice but are reluctant to, since humor enables them to both mitigate the significant risks associated with voice, as well as claim the benefits resulting from voice.",employee voice| cognition| humor

In other words, treating the hazardous traces of our actions alone is insufficient without modifying our values and norms. Building on a longitudinal study of sustainability in the car industry, we argue that the prevailing techno-centered discourse on green information technology and the consequent actions are unlikely to yield the desired outcome. In turn, we suggest that an understanding of the sociomateriality of the construction and disruption of technological development is indispensible for triggering the desired change toward sustainable information technology.  Therefore, we propose extending the prevailing scope of Green IT/IS discourse to include a wide array of sustainable value considerations. Sustainable value refers to value as worth and value as norms. Hence, rather than focusing on ecological sustainability alone, sustainable value refers to a broader conception of value that includes economic, social and environmental value for all stakeholders involved. Moreover, sustainable value is about nourishing normative values that support and promote system-wide sustainable attitudes, behaviors and practices. Following the analysis of the path-dependent nature and the sociomateriality of sustainable value creation in the automotive industry, we apply a number of relevant insights to the information technology domain. First, our results demonstrate the path-dependent nature of sustainable technological development, which is constrained and influenced by the materiality, social structures, and institutional frameworks that comprise the overall sociotechnical system. Second, our findings show that respective social and institutional support is needed to complement technological innovation in order to disrupt existing paths and construct more sustainable alternatives. Third, our results suggest that sustainable value creation requires a concerted effort of all stakeholders to reshape existing norms and values, formulate new standards, and reconfigure work systems vis-a-vis the social and environmental vistas of sustainable value.

(WITHDRAWN),1|Emilio Alvarez-Suescun|Complutense de Madrid||,,"This paper provides empirical evidence on the role that most important economic and strategic factors as well as their interactions may play in information technology (IT) outsourcing decision. It advances prior research by combining transaction cost and resource-based insights, adopting a function-level approach and developing multi-item scales of unobservable concept such as specificity and capability. Hypotheses are tested for the implementation of an HR software application with primary data collected from large Spanish firms. Findings seem to provide more support for resource-based arguments than for transaction-cost propositions. Thus, our results suggest that cumulative knowledge from either coordination and interaction between internal units or experience in IT outsourcing is not a significant factor unless the organization is able to develop a strategic capability. Unlike for technology specificity, no evidence was found for the significance of behavioral uncertainty and the strategic contribution of IT.",make or buy decisions| resourcehuman resource information systems-based theories| implementation

Kaiserslautern||,,"This paper extends research on virtual, written-based knowledge-sharing. Current research on knowledge sharing has either focused on situations of face-to-face contact or has identified computer-mediated communication as an impoverished means for sharing knowledge particularly because of the lack of a shared context. Building on empirical data from virtual knowledge sharing in the form of emails it is suggested to open the black box of computer-mediated knowledge sharing by explicitly focusing on the communicative strategies employed by peers in their efforts to deal with the problem of geographical dispersion. A communicative perspective on knowledge sharing first of all reveals that peers switched between more narrative, intuitive and more argumentative, reflexive modes of communication to make sense and interpret experiences. As the analysis shows reflexive modes of communication were triggered by a number of personal and situative moderates and were used to overcome problems of incoherence, contextuality and contested validity which occurred during the virtual knowledge sharing episodes. Building on insights from the theory of communicative action as developed by Habermas the paper concludes by outlining a model which increases our understanding of virtual, writing-based knowledge sharing and helps in better understanding the interplay of behavioural and communicative processes.",virtual knowledge sharing| narratives| argumentation

However for firms to gain a competitive advantage from knowledge they must accomplish more than the redistribution of existing knowledge.  They must generate new knowledge.  In this paper we describe a framework that can be used by firms to assess the capacity of a KMS to facilitate the generation of new knowledge.  To test the framework we conducted a longitudinal case study in a single company, Pratt Whitney Rocketdyne.  Based on the findings in the case we present a model, called the KM Maturity model, which illustrates how firms develop knowledge management competencies that lead to on-going new knowledge generation.

Despite the benefits associated with online consumer-to-consumer (C2C) auctions, there can be drawbacks.  Consumers who purchase goods in online auctions may get caught up in auction fever, causing them to engage in overbidding, and sometimes leading to what has been referred to as the winners curse. While several theoretical explanations have been proposed to explain overbidding behavior, there has been little empirical work in this area. Drawing on escalation theory, this study develops and tests a model of the overbidding behavior exhibited by individuals in on-line auction settings.  Our model posits that certain escalation drivers such as sunk cost, the completion effect, and self-justification affect an individuals willingness to continue bidding which, in turn, influences overbidding behavior.  Survey data collected from 250 on-line auction participants was used to test the model using partial least squares analysis. Sunk cost, the completion effect, and self-justification were all found to have significant impacts on overbidding behavior that were either partially or fully mediated by willingness to continue bidding.  We also found that competition intensity moderates the relationship between willingness to continue and overbidding behavior such that when competition is more intense, the relationship becomes even stronger.  The implications of these findings for both research and practice are discussed.",online auctions| escalation| overbidding

Previous unreplicated research computed STC from data contained in software repositories and showed that high values of STC in a commercial software engineering setting led to higher team performance, but did not differentiate cleanly between the effects of aligned communication and the effects of general communication.  In this work we utilize software repository data from an Open Source software community to evaluate STC in a very different setting.  We then extend STC, creating an individual metric and two sub-measures that distinguish between communication that is aligned with task dependencies and general communication, and show that general communication has little benefit, while communication aligned with our measure of task dependencies reduces bug resolution time.",communication| coordination| software engineering

These knowledge network changes are based on different factors including the level of task complexity, the individuals personality (high self-monitor), and the level of constraint in the surrounding social networks. Individuals who perceived tasks to be complex tended to drop ties outside their team and instead added more knowledge ties within their team. High self monitors dropped prior knowledge ties within their teams and added new ties outside their teams. Finally, brokerage has mixed impacts on adding and dropping within and outside their teams. Dropping ties within and outside the team was detrimental to the individuals subsequent performance.

Examples include texting or voice-mailing someone when you could call them, and instant messaging, emailing or calling someone who sits nearby. This paper presents an interview-based grounded theory of interaction control as a way to explain why coworkers engage in VBC. The theory con-tends that colleagues sometimes deliberately distance themselves based on their desire to control the time/timing, location, quality, permanence, and other dynamics of their interactions. Rather than attempting to maximize bandwidth, replicate FTF, or expand an existing communication channel, people use supposedly lean media as a way to control their work and workplace relations. The theory appears to explain VBC in a way that existing theories of media choice do not  and may help explain other types of communication media choices as well.",media use| media choice| computer mediated communication

However, Orlikowski and colleagues (2006) lament that ""practices"" are still theoretically underexplored. We conjecture that this may be, at least partly, due to the theoretical complexity and methodological difficulty of researching practices. Since researching practices is presumed to take place in situ, grounded theory approach has been the method of choice. However, most researchers are less concerned with describing the inner workings of how they discovered the focal practices in their published works.  Thus, those interested in studying practices are left to their own devices to figure out the how-to aspects of the grounded discovery of practices. Our research contributes to this stream of the literature through a disciplined reflective account of the challenges tackled when attempting to discover practices in a grounded fashioni.e., the path leading to a published paper .  The practice lens was employed in analyzing a case involving the study of existing practices in a hospital.  Our work highlights the four challenges that were tackled: negotiating with the site to gain access; noticing invisible practices; distinguishing practices via theoretical sensemaking and framing; and engaging the reviewers to persuade them of the legitimacy of the discovered practices.

Existing literature on individual-level technology adoption has explored many aspects of why an individual might adopt a new technology, but has paid little attention to how this adoption affects the incumbent technology. The relationship between new and incumbent technologies is explored in research on whether new technologies cannibalize incumbent technologies, but this literature examines the relationship at the population level and tends not to consider how the relationship may vary among individuals. To fill this gap, we propose that individual-level technology adoption be disaggregated into adoption that supplements the incumbent technology and adoption that substitutes for it. We develop this conceptualization and propose a comprehensive typology of disaggregate adoption patterns by considering the relationships between new and incumbent technologies that individuals may have. We test our conceptualization by examining the adoption of electronic purchasing channels by 13,013 used car dealers over 6.25 years, focusing on whether each dealer used the electronic channels to supplement or substitute for the incumbent physical channel. The patterns proposed in the typology are evident in the data. We also show that several dealers whose total adoption patterns are similar followed different disaggregate adoption patterns. This illustrates that our approach reveals important information which would otherwise remain hidden, which validates our basic premise and helps extend technology adoption theory.",technology adoption| supplements| substitutes

Yet, anecdotal evidence reveals circumstances where highly salient stakeholders are prevented from participating in relevant decision making scenarios.  The authors describe these stakeholders as marginalized and contend that this attribute is a component of a larger unexplored dimension of stakeholder salience termed awareness.  Information asymmetries and power mechanisms are used against unaware stakeholders to ensure they remain marginalized from participation.  The concept of marginalized stakeholders is used in an extended example to explore organizational support of gentrification in inner-city communities.

The institutionally embedded activities of three actors (capital, management and state) serve as sets of explanations for the characteristics of a formally non-binding corporate governance regulation in terms of the issuance, voluntary and evolutionary nature. A fuzzy-set analysis of 22 OECD countries is employed to assess how and why different degrees of membership in different institutional arrangements either influence or do not influence their corporate governance-characteristics. The analysis yields three key findings. First, while prevailing arguments emphasize capital, management or/and state-related pressures, none of these factors were necessary in themselves for determining the characteristics of codes. Second, the state and/or managerial-related institutions appear to be causally relevant only when combined with particular capital-related institutional conditions. Third, the analyses distil existing multi-causal explanations of code characteristics by showing several distinct, theoretically and empirically causal pathways to a specific outcome. Thus, incorporating actor-centered institutional contextuality (and complementarity) in the analysis of codes of corporate governance offers a more fine-grained perspective on the cross-national diversity of these institutionalized best practices.",corporate governance codes| institutional complementarity| actor-centered institutionalism

In the 1990s, India implemented fundamental changes to its international trade policy, cutting tariffs by more than 75 percent and shifting the policy focus from a tariff-based system to a government-administered system of Antidumping (AD) and safeguards. To obtain trade protection under the new system, firms had to petition the government for relief and could no longer rely on receiving it automatically in the form of tariffs. Firms had little knowledge of the new policy rules, making the transaction costs of filing AD petitions very high.  Using firm-level data on Indian firms and antidumping cases, we examine characteristics of firms that adapted early to the new trade regime by filing AD petitions in the years following the policy change.  We predicted that early adapters would be motivated by economic need and would possess relevant capabilities. We find that financially constrained firms are more active AD petitioners, as are firms with political, international trade and collective action experience.

Following the emerging perspective of agency behaviors in alliances, we exam if managerial self-serving is a significant concern in alliances as in acquisitions, diversification, and forms of corporate investments. Using a sample of 1743 US firms which announces alliance investments from 2001 to 2006, we find support for the presence of agency hazards, thereby the significance of governance mechanisms in alliances. Stock market penalizes alliance investments which are susceptible to managerial misalignment, in that less governed manager, in terms of fewer stockholdings, less equity-based compensation, and less frequent board meetings, tend to initiate alliances detracting shareholder wealth. The governance benefit takes on growing significance as agency hazard is more severe, in which non-core (instead of core) industries and international (instead of domestic) locations magnify the disciplinary effect of governance measures. Our results suggest that managerial motivations underlying alliance undertakings are not as ideally positive as stated in the conventional alliance literature. Both practitioners and researchers should be cautious imputing certainly positive managerial motivations underlying alliance investments.",alliances| agency theory| corporate governance

However, this neglects the fundamental changes of the operating conditions of business due to globalization and the weakening of regulatory frameworks. This not only changes the role of business, rendering it a political actor in part. Furthermore, the very assumptions of dominant corporate governance theory are challenged. These developments can be regarded as a potential threat for organizational legitimacy. Whereas in the traditional view, corporate governance safeguarded organizational legitimacy by safeguarding organizational efficiency and thereby contributed to societal welfare and the legitimacy of the economic system as a whole, this congruence is not given in the absence of legal and regulatory frameworks. Drawing on suggestions to restore organizational legitimacy by means of discursive processes, I argue that corporate governance needs to become open to such processes to safeguard organizational legitimacy and therewith the legitimacy of the economic system in a globalized world. Based on these considerations, I will introduce basic requirements as well as limits for an according modification of current corporate governance practice.",corporate governance| globalization| political role of the firm

Covering the 3-year period from 2006-2008 and focusing on S&P 500 firms, we use environmental shareholder resolutions as a proxy for direct engagement strategies and requests for information by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), on behalf of 385 investors, to measure indirect engagement strategies. We triangulate our findings with data on environmental performance published by KLD and financial performance ratios obtained through Compustat to determine their impact on corporate responses to resolutions and requests for information. We find that overall corporations tend to respond more positively to indirect engagement strategies than to direct engagement strategies. We also find that, consistent with prior literature, both a firms environmental and financial performance are significant factors in its response to direct and indirect engagement strategies on the environment and that the quality of firms disclosures to the CDP is highly concordant with the firms environmental performance in a non-linear association pattern. However, contrary to prevailing literature, we find that the presence of environmental concerns is not a necessary element for firms to be targeted by shareholder resolutions and represents a category of firms that is under-researched. Lastly, a firms industry and its proximity to the consumer show significance with regard to response patterns.",environmental performance| shareholder resolutions| stakeholder theory

A significant proportion of the findings of these studies appear to assume that corporate social and financial performance share the same market logic and common exchange currencies. This paper aims to re-examine this taken-for-granted assumption in the extant literature. Based on data drawn from the challenges of mainstreaming the market for responsible investments, it argues the case that corporate responsibility is a unique economic paradigm that will either need to develop its own market, in order to be viable, or lend itself to be easily translatable into the dominant logic of calculation and singularization characteristic of the conventional financial markets. In other words, not everything about corporate responsibility is measurable as much as the financial markets would ask for. Comparing what is rendered measurable, on one hand, and what is yet to lend itself to measurability, on the other, is, therefore, a fundamental flaw in this literature. As such, corporate responsibility and financial performance will continue to run on competing logics until their different markets are distinctively articulated and/or aligned.",corporate social performance| competing market logics| market for corporate social actions

Business and society literature is integrated with social psychology literature to develop a theoretical research model that is empirically tested with two stakeholder groups, customers and employees. The findings of the studies with customers (n=708) and employees (n=359) of a service organization in the UK indicate that the CR-related experiences, observations and beliefs of customers and employees significantly impact the development of trust and positive intent towards the organization. The findings also indicate that beliefs about CR partially mediate the relationships between experiences, observations and the development of trust. In addition to these findings, the research establishes a process by which the concept of CR can be operationalized in stakeholder relationships, and thereby contributes to the understanding of how CR can be measured, managed and demonstrated within a stakeholder theory approach.",corporate responsibility| stakeholders| pls graph

Rather than test for the presence of a static definition of privacy, the factorial vignette method supports identifying the factors and their relative importance that respondents take into consideration in calculating an expectation of privacy.  The results demonstrate that the equations-inside-the-head of respondents contained consistently significant factors such as the respondents sex, the informational content in the vignette, and locating the vignette scenario on Facebook.  In addition, a number of factors were significant yet not consistent within either a vignette scenario or a particular subgroup of respondents.

We present 3 experiments that reveal a previously unrecognized perverse effect of disclosure: Disclosure of an advisors conflict of interest can decrease advisees trust in the advice while simultaneously increasing pressure to comply with that advice. This compliance pressure comes from two mechanisms: (1) recipients fear signaling distrust of the advisor, and (2) recipients feel an increased pressure to help their advisor when the advisors personal interests have been disclosed. Hence, disclosure can place a burden on those it was supposed to protect. We also show that the increased pressure to comply effect is reduced if the disclosure is provided by an external source rather than directly from the advisor.",conflicts of interest| disclosure| ethics

Both theoretical and applied research along with anecdotal evidence suggests that the complexity of ethical systems makes it difficult for academics and practitioners to research and understand. Perhaps due, in part, to their complexity and the difficulty in their dissection to create prescriptive accounts, design and implementation of ethical systems often do not meet expectations. Employing tenets of the qualitative research tradition can illuminate the complexities and multiple variables within a given phenomenon. It is through this qualitative lens that we examine the honor and ethics system at the United States Military Academy at West Point. Our findings support the notion of inherent and subtle complexities found in ethical systems. However, our research suggests that the complexity of an ethical system can be better understood by examining the competing forces that simultaneously work for and against ethical systems. We suggest that the efficacy of the ethical system can be enhanced by first identifying possible competing tensions and then by determining a strategy to reconcile them, if needed. Our endeavor offers initial grounded theory regarding the role of tension management in the design of effective ethical systems.",ethics| codes| qualitative

Yet, over time, while social performance of family firms steadily increases during the first three family generations, this positive effect of family ownership disappears later. More specifically, while family firms exhibit superior social performance when dealing with local communities or when addressing environmental issues, they do not significantly perform better than non family firm in the employees relations area. Then, using a cross-sectional analysis of 2009' s rankings of environmental performance (separating perceived performance-reputation, and effective performance), we found that some categories of stakeholders develop higher social expectations toward family firms than non family firms.

In addition to establishing a conceptual link between stock-based CEO compensation and CSP, this paper clarifies their relationship by addressing three empirical issues overlooked in previous studies. First, I examine the possible difference between cumulative and annual stock option grants. Second, I examine the unique effect of in-the-money stock options. Third, I show that accounting for firm-level unobserved heterogeneities makes a substantial difference in estimation results. The results reveal that the relationships between stock-based compensation and CSP are substantially different when unobserved heterogeneities are accounted for, that a single year!-s stock option grant does not have a significant impact on CSP while a cumulative grant does, and that in-the-money and at-the-money stock options have opposite effects on CSP.",corporate social performance| stock-based ceo compensation| risk-taking

In these situations, managers have more freedom to implement value-enhancing strategies, such those related to corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities. This is a good-type of entrenchment. On the other hand, when the external pressure is not so high, given that the pressure is from inside the firm, managerial entrenchment is bad and the use of CSR investments may exacerbate the agency problem. We prove this claim in an empirical study conducted of 279 international firms that operate in 22 different countries for the period 2002-2005.

Second, a specific type of learned, cognitive empathy is proposed as a variable that may play a significant role in ethical decision-making, referred to as decision-making perspective-taking.  Third, measures of the proposed construct are developed and examined in relation to various individual differences for assessing construct validity, including empathic tendencies, personality, several emotion-related variables, moral meaningfulness, and moral judgment.

The model presented here also allows predictions to be made about how a number of factors are likely to influence which ethical decision making route will be taken.

But to achieve ethical performance, managers need to understand how to respond to their ethical challenges with professional moral courage. To address this concern, ethics education and training in organizations needs to be reconceptualized as an ability that individuals can learn, develop, and apply, rather than a trait that may or may not be present. In this paper we argue that most people have an ability to respond to an ethical challenge with moral action, and that this ability can be exercised and toned. After detailing the moral muscles that contribute to professional moral courage, we describe a process to help employees strengthen these various competencies to support positive ethics in the workplace.

However, little is known about the consequences of those actions on employees and even less is known about how or even whether, organizations can recover from those ethical violations. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of unethical activity on employees and explore organizations that have failed ethically and their attempts at recovery.  This study explores two issues. First, how do employees react to organizational unethical behavior (OUB) and to what extent are those reactions dependent on contextual and individual factors?  Second, to what extent can organizations recover from the negative impacts of ethical failure?  More specifically, is it possible for organizations that fail in their ethical responsibilities to recover such that they are paradoxically better-off than their counterparts that never failed in the first place? To explore these issues we integrate and draw upon the ethical decision-making and service failure recovery literatures for theoretical support. Empirical testing included first, a  field study using survey data acquired from the Ethics Resource Center (ERC) in which over 29,000 participants were asked about their perceptions of ethics at work.  Results revealed a negative direct effect of severity and controllability of the OUB on perceptions of organizational ethicality and a negative direct effect of controllability of the OUB on organizational satisfaction.  Ethical context moderated the relationship between OUB controllability and perceived organizational ethicality.

Empirical studies show mixed results. Some studies find that substantial differences in rewards across hierarchical levels have a positive impact because they provide a strong incentive for employees to increase their efforts. Others studies suggest that large wage differences have a negative impact because they undermine cooperation. While existing work has typically assumed a universal effect of pay dispersion on firm performance, the purpose of this paper is to unravel the contingent nature of the relationship. The paper draws on the literature on pay dispersion and recent findings in behavioral economics and social psychology to show that the impact of vertical pay dispersion on firm performance depends on (1) the relative importance of individual versus collective activities in value creation processes, (2) employees heterogeneous motives to contribute to value creation, and (3) culturally specific fairness norms. Two implications of the analysis are discussed: that the dark side of intra-firm pay dispersion becomes increasingly problematic as economies become more knowledge-intensive, and that increasing intra-firm pay dispersion is especially likely to undermine firm performance in stakeholder as opposed to shareholder oriented cultures.",pay dispersion| fairness| governance

Using a case study analysis and combining literature on stakeholder management and sociology (Actor Network Theory), we identify two keys for a successful involvement: contextualisation and problematisation. We also find that CSR certifications are not limited to answer to stakeholder pressure and highlight a proactive organisational stance that evokes the complexity of involving stakeholders around a CSR certification goal.",corporate social responsibility| stakeholder involvement| stakeholder salience| || csr certification| actor network theory.

Yet the recent crisis suggests that actors with overly self-interested behavior sill dominate business activities, leading to a legitimacy crisis. I argue here that the concept of moral isomorphism might explain both why overly self-interested behaviors might be observed in the current business world, and why the solution might not rely primarily in increasing the managers' level of moral development. Referring to institutional theory, I define moral isomorphism as the isomorphism process related to moral or ethical issues. Moral isomorphism can be linked to Kohlberg's conventional moral thinking, a morality defined as 'following surrounding norms', and leading to what Suchman's calls cognitive legitimacy. This 'following surrounding norms' characteristic implies that conventional actors with 'normal' moral thinking might adopt overly greedy behaviors if they believe this is the norm expected from them  without necessarily being intrinsically 'bad' people. It further suggests that such people might adopt more relational or collective moral thinking again  provided that a new standard emerges around them. In consequence, the business world might be less in need of an increase of individual moral thinking than of a change in the institutional norms to be adopted by the many conventional actors with moral isomorphism attitude.",institutional theory| moral development| moral isomorphism

Following the research call of Ashforth, Gioia, Robinson, and Trevino (2008), this work presents a dynamic model of organizational corruption, explaining systemic nature of the phenomenon, integrating individual, group, organizational, and institutional levels of analysis, and bridging research domains. The framework is rooted in Social Dominance Theory (Sidanius and Pratto, 1999), suggesting that corruption is interrelated with human tendency to form group-based social hierarchies, and proposing that the processes involved in forming and maintaining group-based hierarchies are dynamically and systemically related to collective organizational corruption. I posit that socially-dominant individuals endorsing group-based hierarchies are likely to be less aware of organizational corruption and more likely to make judgments initiating and supporting corrupt acts within organizations. I further argue that individuals perceptions and judgments of corruption are supported by hierarchy-enhancing institutions, including organizations, industries, and national cultures. I also propose that corrupt acts are initiated and supported by members of non-dominant groups, who actively participate and contribute to power inequality and collective organizational corruption through processes described as behavioral asymmetry. Finally, I suggest that group-based hierarchies and organizational corruption are coordinated through dynamic processes of person-environmental fit and legitimizing myths. Implications for research and practice are presented.",organizational corruption| hierarchies| social dominance

It is thereby argued that existing empirical research often fails to account for diachronically changing mechanisms causing the spread of CSR practices. Central theoretical contributions from neo-institutional theory, espe-cially concerning the role of language in processes of institutional change, are employed in order to develop a content analytical research approach. On that basis, dominant discursive legitimation strategies supporting codes of conduct articulated by important media within the German textile and apparel industry across a time period of 10 years are analyzed. The results of this analysis point to central diffusion mechanisms of codes of conduct within this industry.

I make use of Jacques Derridas work on contested meaning to argue that CSRs ambiguity is actually necessary in light of its functional role as a supplement to corporate profit-seeking. As a discourse that refuses to answer the undecidable profit-question, CSR preserves an important critical perspective which demands firms act responsibly. CSR does this by ambiguously affirming both profit-seeking and social responsibility, a necessary contradiction. Attempts to reduce CSRs ambiguity can thus only succeed by undermining its viability as a successful normative discourse.",corporate social responsibility| discourse| derrida

One of these identities is derived from an orientation addressed towards a larger collective, such as society, while the other derives from an organizing logic of efficiency. Although both these identities are required to ensure care with efficiency, this duality is inherently conflict prone. In contrast to suggestions available in literature on managing such organizational identity conflicts, the case suggests that one way to resolve this issue is by differentiating the organization into two, each part reflecting one of the identities, and  connecting them through an interlocking mechanism. The concept of dual core identity organizations is proposed and its implications for research on nonprofit management, business-society relationships and corporate-nonprofit relationships are discussed.",organizational identity conflict| care giving organizations| interlocking directorates

Our main point is that in trying to reduce their cognitive dissonance, these executives influence the evolution of their firms CSR.

However, disasters also have negative impacts on the very same firms, and we typically expect firms to give less, not more, under adverse economic conditions. This paper explores a strategic explanation for high-profile corporate magnanimity in times of crisis. Specifically, we investigate whether those firms known for social irresponsibility suffered the greatest losses in firm value when Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast and whether such firms were more likely to make donations as a result. We generate a number of findings that contribute to the literature on the value of corporate social responsibility (CSR), reputation, and corporate philanthropy. First, we find that the more a firm was known for bad deeds, the greater the loss of firm value when Katrina hit, regardless of its concurrent history of good deeds. Second, we find that philanthropic disaster response is significantly more likely when a firm is known for bad deeds. We conclude that short-term value-enhancing motives for philanthropic disaster response may be misguided: managers interested in capturing value from CSR should focus instead on reducing their firms' irresponsible behaviors.",corporate philanthropy| irresponsibility| firm value

Whilst CSR is often viewed as self-regulation, and thus CSR and government reflect no obvious relationship, we identify a number of different types of CSR-government configurations; namely, CSR as endorsed by, facilitated by, in partnership with, mandated by, and as an alternative form of government. We illuminate these configurations by examining empirically the CSR practices in Western Europe and Northeast Asia in a comparative historical perspective. We attribute the neglected variety of CSR-government relations to the inadequate attention paid, by the extant CSR literature, to divergent national governance systems and the path-dependent way in which CSR has diffused, further mediated by government agency. Given the rising importance of CSR, we demonstrate that there is a varied role that the governments can play in order to promote CSR in accordance with the wider national governance systems.",csr| government| comparative

The debate is well worn among philosophers, bioethicists and sociologists. This paper considers a novel aspect, the contribution of economics to the topic. It shows that economics enters the debates over organ transplants in three ways. First of all, in the philosophical literature over organ sales, protagonists of the market rely on a distinctly neo-classical conception of the possibilities afforded by the market system. Secondly, assuming that a working market will ease shortages, economists debate the feasibility of efficient market function. Finally, games theorists and operations researchers challenge medical ethics with ruthless calculations of efficient allocation. This paper analyses the relationship of economics with ethics and highlights the negative effects of calculation on compassionate practice.",ethics| performativity| organ transplants

People in general and people in business have their own sets of beliefs that may have been somewhat influenced by business ethicists and organizational scholars but not more than a bit. Those beliefs often have flaws, an obvious one being that especially in the business world these beliefs are (morally) unimaginative and too undemanding. Perhaps this is all we can reasonably hope for. But business ethicists should seriously consider what we can expect to contribute to these ethics and to the field. Two academic traditions are in the process of consolidation in our field, namely, normative and behavioral business ethics. The purpose of this paper is to explore the plausibility of the very distinction between a normative and a behavioral domain of research in business ethics and the examination of strategies for the collaboration of both traditions.In the course of this paper, I shall argue that the normative/descriptive divide in business ethics research is just a reflection of the is/ought distinction. And I shall conclude that the two strategies business ethicists have postulated to deal with the dichotomy, namely, separation and integration, are equally problematic because of the entanglement of facts and values and because of the need to preserve the logic and identity of the normative and the empirical inquiry. Rather than separation or integration, I shall propose a strategy of reconciliation, which does not entail synthesizing or dividing them but rather respecting the identity of both approaches while recognizing the limitations they place on each other.",normative ethics| psychological realism| is-ought thesis

In doing so, the paper first argues that governments are not entirely hamstrung by globalizing forces, and that they should thus continue to try to solve various market failures by altering the regulative frameworks within which corporations operate. Second the paper argues that, whatever else their differences, the later works of Habermas and Rawls are, despite Palazzo and Scherer suggesting otherwise, more consistent with a liberal than republican perspective of corporate political action. Third, the paper argues that profit focused corporations will commonly have reason to support state centric governance frameworks; and that, whilst the political activities of profit focused corporations can often be conceived as forms of rent seeking, this does not necessitate that managerial decision making become increasingly ethical or moral. Taken together, these three arguments positively suggest that a liberal perspective of corporate political action remains desirable in our currently globalized world.",corproate social responsibility| politics and globalization| republican and liberal corporations

Yet, the literature remains divided in its measurement approach  either aggregated or disaggregated  and therefore little is known specifically about how the overall nature (breadth and depth) of the corporate social strategies pursued by the firm might affect CFP. More importantly, little research has considered specifically that the absence of any social or environmental programs is also a strategic choice that is conceptually distinct from firms that choose to pursue even one CSP initiative. Herein I introduce the new construct of corporate social strategy (CSS) which reflects this strategic choice and defines the nature of stakeholder and social issues pursued by the firm by using an Entropy measure to assess the breadth of CSS and a specialization ratio to assess the depth of CSS. The resulting typology allows one to classify corporate social strategies as either disengaged, derivative, diffuse, dedicated or devoted. This new typology is tested using a sample of 147 manufacturing firms. Findings confirm that a disengaged CSS in particular is negatively related to CFP.

Through a discourse analysis of more than 750 projects presented to the Asian CSR Awards we firstly acknowledge the homogeneity of the discourse used by companies of all sorts to legitimize their actions. We distinguish two main argumentation repertoires, one based on a symbolic logic and a second based on a managerial logic. We argue that the two argumentation repertoires are used in confrontation that mirrors the paradoxes of managing sustainability projects. The firm rhetoric reproduces the distance between the output oriented legitimacy (through the managerial rhetoric) and the input oriented (through the symbolic rhetoric). We also observe that each type of rhetoric has evolved over the past 6 years in a way that we can trace the trends in the management of sustainability projects. Finally, we acknowledge differences in the argumentation repertoires depending on the organization characteristics. Each type of company manages its rhetoric to serve their legitimacy needs. On the one hand, local and small organizations tend to use a more managerial discourse as their legitimacy need is centered in the maintaining of the license to operate. On the other hand, global and large corporations legitimize themselves through a more symbolic discourse appealing at the importance of stakeholder engagement, partnerships and sustainability. This might be a sign of their need to still gain their license to operate.",corporate social responsibility| legitimacy| rhetoric

Following a systematic multi-stage search procedure, we identified and coded 92 BOP-related papers. Based on our findings, we propose an organizing framework to help identify what we know and what is left to explore in this literature. Overall, we find that there is little consensus regarding the definition of the BOP. We find, contrary to what is often claimed, that BOP initiatives are typically initiated by local firms, both large and small, and non-profits, rather than multinationals. We find that most BOP business models reported in the literature view the poor as consumers of somewhat adapted products rather than co-inventors and entrepreneurs. Finally, we find that empirical evidence of the economic, social, and environmental impact of BOP initiatives is not only limited, but also scattered, and that, in particular, very little attention has been paid to the implications of the BOP concept for the environment.",base of the pyramid| bottom of the pyramid| poverty

Microfinance and microcredit are two inclusive finance strategies that represent two of these ways. In this paper, we attempt to shed some light on conditions helping to increase social inclusion by investigating the replication of microcredit methodologies in a particular context: Brazil. A qualitative in-depth case study, focusing the path of a Brazilian microfinance institution (MFI) called CrediAmigo, was conducted during 6 months. Our specific research question was: what are the conditions facilitating the replication of the CrediAmigo methodology, implemented successfully in the Northeast of Brazil, to other Brazilian regions? This study is probably the first to provide an integrated perspective of critical issues related to the replication of microcredit methodologies in a Brazilian context and the findings reported here are likely to support managers of MFIs, as well as Brazilian policy makers, in taking steps to increase the chances of success in the expansion of microcredit operations across Brazil. The transferability of the results of this study to other contexts than the Brazilian one is open to future investigation.",inclusive finance| social inclusion| microcredit methodology

Compared with the research attention to the macro-level challenges faced by MNCs in their worldwide operations, little is known about the psychology and behavior of individuals, particularly Host Country National (HCN) employees of local subsidiaries. Based on a literature review of multiple social identities, I introduce the focal construct, bicultural identity integration, which describes HCN employees views regarding the relationships between their identities associated with MNC organizational culture and the culture of local society. Underpinned by the theories on multiple social identities, I developed hypotheses on the association between organizational attitudes (i.e. cultural distance, organizational identification, and continuance commitment) and bicultural identity integration. I conducted analyses on survey data from employees in local subsidiaries of multi-national corporations across China to test my hypotheses. Results of a pilot study indicated that cultural distance, organizational identification and continuance commitment were related to bicultural identity integration of MNC employees. Moreover, my empirical results provided evidence to my argument regarding the moderating role of continuance commitment: for HCN employees with high continuance commitment, the negative relationships bicultural identity integration had with the other two constructs (cultural distance, organizational identification) were stronger.",biculturalism| host country national employee| continuance commitment

It is also a society with high group collectivism but lower assertiveness i.e. people express pride in and loyalty to their families and in-groups, and avoid confrontational and aggressive behavior. Comparing with other countries, Pakistan does not fall into any one GLOBE clusters, as there are similarities between Pakistan and geographical neighbors like India as well as Muslim countries like Kuwait, Egypt, Morocco and Nigeria. Scores on the dimension of uncertainty avoidance are similar to Japan and United States.

Based on a USPTO database covering innovative activities of large industrial firms from 20 foreign countries in the U.S from 1969 to 1995, our study suggests that development of technologies in GPT fields as peripheral technologies is positively associated with the degree of technological diversification of that subsidiary, and degree of geographical dispersion of technology creation activities of firms in host countries.

Fusing these conflicting views, this paper develops a model that draws on agency theory and captures both the benefits and the dangers of subsidiary innovation seen from an MNE perspective. Unlike most economic models of the MNE where knowledge and innovation are treated as exogenouos, we endogenize knowledge production in a geographically distributed network. We show that a complex interaction between the cost of innovation and the relative bargaining strength provided by upstream and downstream competences determines the equilibrium level of innovation, which may deviate from the optimal level by being either too small or too large.

Moreover, based on dual process theories we argue that foreigners perceptions of ambiguity are less hurting in situations where they do not need to make substantial commitments, such as mere statements of interest. Empirical findings based on two independent datasets support our hypotheses on the smaller influence of foreigners risk attitudes on the decision to become an entrepreneur and the moderating impact of personal commitment. The results confirm that the perception of ambiguity depends on an individuals degree of embeddedness and the personal involvement mirrored by the commitment made.",liability of foreignness| perception of risk and ambiguity| commitment

Individual emotional and intellectual evolution lies at the heart of the ability EI model, which I interpret as a form of emotional divergence that individuals harness in managing their daily lives.

Sacramento||,,"The puzzling failure of scholars of corporate social responsibility (CSR) to conceptualize and incorporate within their work the most important political economic trends of the last generation becomes explicable upon examining the changing historical role of CSR.  Following Arrighi (1994), this construct can best be understood as an attempt to ameliorate the American economic hegemony of the twentieth century, an hegemony based on the large American corporation, whose extraordinary degree of autonomy raised the crucial question as to how this autonomy could be responsibly employed.  As American industrial hegemony grew in the first third of the century, early CSR discourse focused on labor-management cooperation in an effort to promote productivity and restore social peace.  After American hegemony broadened after World War II, academics expanded the scope of CSR in order to place the modern corporation with a presumed pluralistic system refereed by a regulatory state.  As American hegemony entered a final generation characterized by financial hypertrophy coupled to a squeeze on labor, CSR scholarship embraced an enlightened managerialism in order to counter the pressures of finance ideology.  The failure of this last approach -- crippled by its avoidance of controversial issues that might undermine its implicit legitimization of managerial power -- is attributable to unrealistic expectations regarding the power and interests of corporate executives.   Future efforts to formulate those responsibilities that ought to be assumed or imposed upon corporations will have to transcend the provincial assumptions of this American-dominated discourse, and build upon the perspectives and experiences of other societies.",business ethics| world systems theory| business and society

Under these circumstances, and especially in the wake of the financial crisis, corporate social responsibility is increasingly equated with notions such as accountability and transparency. The assumption seems to be that corporate social responsibility is ensured as long as organizations and their leaders are accountable and transparent vis-a-vis their stakeholders (e.g., Rawlins, 2009). We challenge this assumption. Not only because polyphony and ambiguity is inevitable in human communication, but also because the quest for accountability and transparency is bound to fail.

Literature on the consumption of images depicting catastrophes suggests that the viewers response can be sorted into three categories: vicarious traumas, which implies over-arousal, b) empty empathy which implies inert passivity, and, finally, c) witnessing, a pro-social, possible ethical engagement with the suffering in question (Kaplan, 2008). In an attempt to evoke the third of these responses, the paper juxtaposes a detail from the photo with the painting. The aim is to occasion an iconoclastic transvaluation of the values of these already established icons within the worlds collective memory. Yet, this memory is rather collectively instructed (Sontag) in order to conceal its horrific abject (Kristeva). The juxtaposition creates a third image in a process that affords an experiment into how we may enter into a becoming witnesses as viewers, more able, from time to time, to deal with the abjects of our time.",holocaust| organizational aesthetics| ethics

Whereas museums are often described as secular institutions, reluctant to innovation and devoted initially to the preservation of cultural heritage, they recently entered a new era where management has become critical to support their future. Emergent managerial practices have prompted a significant amount of research, most of which characterizes a new age for the large museum, the competition paradigm: these accounts frame the contemporary museum trend as being one in which globalisation, economic value creation and pressures for income building. This article argues that these accounts of museums strategies are somehow restrictive and incomplete. It builds on a design perspective of management to give an alternative account of the historical and contemporary transformations. Museums genealogy shows that these organisations face a shift from traditional rule-based approach to more innovative design methods, which profoundly destabilizes curatorship and traditional organisations. The paper is based on empirical evidence within a large art museum, the Louvre, which implements considerable efforts to seek this form of design-driven innovation, especially by undertaking an R&D on art display. It argues that museums are currently engaging in a creative process aimed at forging new meanings and renewing the symbolic value of their main product: exhibition and collection display; exploring new valorisations appears at the forefront of museum strategy.",design| strategy| museum

For each role, we unpack the principles, relations and relational processes underpinning value creation. We then develop a set of generative tensions that help fill out the interstices among different critical theory strands.

The first studies in market orientation were undertaken in the US, and had a focus on large business firms. Subsequently research included public organizations and non-profit organizations. In parallel to the geopolitical expansion of neoliberalism research took a focus on developing countries and then on emerging economies. The successful trajectory of market orientation helped raise the strategic status of the field of marketing but also insulated researchers from criticisms about the relevance of the discipline and from developments from other fields concerning the disputes between types of capitalism, the neoliberal feature of management knowledge, and the political position of emerging economies in the post-Cold War international context. Drawing upon an international critical perspective this paper posits that the market orientation literature reproduces assumptions that are chiefly problematic for emerging economies  such as Brazil  and, accordingly, that critique in marketing should go beyond the Anglo-American contributions. In the end, the author presents guidelines for a critical perspective in marketing orientation from an emerging economy.",critical marketing| emerging economies| international relations
2181,Identity|| Agency|| Diversity,1|Rethinking Agency in Corporations: Deleuze & Guattaris reframing of identity,1|Mollie Painter-Morland|De Paul U.||,,"The current debates around corporate agency and individual moral agency within corporations display a number of assumptions that call for critical interrogation. In the first place, many theorists seem to assume that corporations and the individuals that operate within them, have distinct identities that allow them to act as agents. In the case of corporations, their identities are often described in terms of organizational cultures. In terms of individuals, much attention is paid to the fiduciary duties that executives have, and the development of their personal integrity through various kinds of ethics training sessions and awareness raising programs. But can we describe these agents in terms of their moral identities? How do they come into existence? In this paper, I start with an excursion into now familiar ground of agency theory within business ethics and management theory. I then propose that these theories fail because they fail to critically interrogate the idea of identity that underpins agency constructs. Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari trace the origins of both corporations and individuals back to the basic flows of desire that make up the world (Deleuze & Guattari, 1983: 244). I argue that they give us reason to be less certain in our claims about corporate and individual identity. To understand how we come to know ourselves as subjects or agents of decisions and actions, we may need to conceive of identity in a new way. Deleuze and Guattaris view of the subject moves us away from identity towards multiplicity. Within each one of us, there are multiple flows and desires, which connect spontaneously with the forces within other human beings and institutions. The desiring-production that is constantly operating creates multiple effects, of which identity is one. Identity is therefore not something we actively create or choose, but an effect of these multiplicities and the ongoing shifts in the processes of desiring-production that is part of its various cycles. Deleuze rejects the idea that the self is an integrated global whole  instead, he explains that what we call self, is in fact the result of thousands of little witnesses which contemplate within us (Deleuze, 1994:74-75).  This understanding of self has important implications for the discussion of agency within corporations, especially when once conceives of corporations as complex adaptive systems.",agency theory| complexity| deleuze

Our specific goal is to analyse how differences of a colonial mould preserve social hierarchies, which manifest themselves in scientific research. This analysis is the result of ethnography carried out in a British organization and it shows how the Brazilian researcher is perceived by his European object of study. In order to understand this relationship, the article uses post-colonial theory for analysis based on criticism of Eurocentrism and its intention to achieve uni-versal knowledge and thus produce a truth about The Other, who is an inferior non-European. In this case, it is expressed in the form of a Tropicalism that attributes various stereotypes to the inhabitants of the Latin American continent and is characterized by epistemic racism. The results of the analysis have led us to the conclusion that even when the non-European is the researcher, who sees the European as The Other, there is an inversion of roles which puts the non-European back in the position of The Other  which historically has been seen by traditional epistemology as the object of research (and speculation) by the European subject. As a result, the supposed separation between the subject and object of research as a methodological resource for the analysis of social phenomena is compromised, as it is not possible to apply this separation during the course of scientific research.",postcolonialism| ethnography| qualitative research

I propose a description of three distinct types of self-construction of diversity: distinction, differentiation and distancing. I use a a five-step multimethod approach. This makes it possible to determine the groupings made by the actors themselves. The actors make groupings based on their perception of what is legitimate. This approach also allows us to observe the intensity and prevalence of these groupings in their rethorical schemes. The study suggests that a cross-cultural relationship should not only be analysed according to national cultures or identities, but also in terms of the different forms of diversity at play in the categorization of the actors. The implication of the article concerns the importance of not considering culture as central to intercultural discourses and suggests measuring the impact of these discourses on organizations.",diversity's construction| cross-cultural management| india

To test this proposition, this study examined the lagged effects of MNCs innovative capabilities on future international diversification strategies which, in turn, leads to future MNCs innovative capabilities on three key indicators of future innovation: changes in R&D intensity, number of patents, and technological strengths after controlling for product diversification strategies.  The analyses used a sample of the largest 210 MNCs from Europe, Japan and North America representing nine industries.

North American mergers, for example, were driven by large and friendly acquirers, using externally sourced cash to domestically diversify. European mergers were about integration, and were financed with internally generated cash. Just as Asian mergers used the sixth wave to focus on core competence building, and were increasingly hostile and increasingly expensive.

The rising amount of FDI in this region is accompanied by a growing number of Western expatriates who are assigned into this region. Based on data of 113 German expatriates, this paper analyzes how four different aspects of work roles influence work adjustment in CEE. The results show that particularly the absence of role conflicts can be understood as a major antecedent of expatriate work adjustment in the selected emerging market context. The results of the regression analysis provide support for the detrimental impact of role conflicts on work adjustment at a high level of statistical significance. Furthermore, less significant evidence is found for a positive impact of role. The assumed impact of role flexibility and role novelty on work adjustment is not supported.

Evidence from Japanese Machinery Firms,1|Guo-Liang Frank Jiang|Dalhousie U.||2|Guy Holburn|U. of Western Ontario||,,"Drawing on performance feedback theory, this study examines the relationship between corporate performance and subsequent foreign investment decisions. It is argued that a firms performance relative to its aspiration levels influences its propensity to engage in foreign investment as well as its choice of investment location. We propose that an improvement in performance relative to aspiration levels of performance reduces the propensity for international investment and that the deterrent impact of country distance on foreign entry is contingent on relative performance. Consistent with the theory, an analysis of investments in foreign manufacturing facilities made by 206 Japanese machinery firms between 1986 and 2002 shows that foreign investment propensity is overall negatively related to prior firm performance relative to aspiration levels. The likelihood of foreign investment decreases when firm performance exceeds historical and social aspirations. The probability of foreign entry does not significantly increase as performance falls below aspirations, however is still greater than when performance exceeds aspirations. In addition, outperforming and underperforming firms were more likely to enter host countries with larger geographic and institutional distances from Japan, implying extended search efforts and/or greater risk-taking behavior.",performance feedback| location choice| fdi

Despite extensive scrutiny of the motivations for firms to engage in FDI, we know relatively little about the impact of FDI on host country firms, and especially, how inward FDI affects the innovative productivity of those firms. Extant theoretical arguments predict contrasting effects. One line of research suggests positive externalities to host country firms resulting in increased learning. Another line of research highlights the deleterious consequences to host country firms resulting from increased competition. Utilizing data from 1,836 Spanish manufacturing firms from 19902002, we investigate the impact of industry-level and firm-level inward FDI on the innovative productivity of host country firms.

I argue that greenfields usually allow multinationals to buy the external assets required for entry sequentially while acquisitions generally require multinationals to buy all these assets immediately upon entry, causing greenfields to have a real options advantage over acquisitions. I expect the value of this advantage, and hence the likelihood of greenfield entry, to increase with policy uncertainty. I also expect managers perceptions of the additional options value of greenfields at a given policy uncertainty level, and hence their preference for greenfield entry at that uncertainty level, to vary with their subsidiary autonomy plans and demand growth forecasts. These expectations are confirmed by an analysis of 169 foreign entries by Dutch multinationals. My findings show that policy uncertainty influences the relative options value of rival full control entry modes, and that the magnitude of this influence depends on behavioral factors.",entry mode choice| real options| policy uncertainty

This study argues how host country national cultural dimensions can matter for the mode of entry adopted in cross-border mergers and acquisitions.  It is proposed that each of the five dimensions of Hofstedes national culture can be treated as causing parametric shifts in the informal institutional environment of the comparative economic organization framework provided by Williamson (1991), thus impacting governance costs, and observably, entry mode. Pegging home country of analysis at India, the results of analysing 830 deals between 1980 to 2009 show that host country values for individualism, adjusted for per-capita national income, and long-term-orientation, proxied by the countrys marginal propensity to save, are positively associated with the adoption of hierarchical over hybrid modes.",entry mode| cultural distance| national culture| comparative economic organization| transaction cost economics

We use data on 275 JVs formed by European firms in emerging economies during 1996 and survival analysis to test our hypotheses. Our findings indicate that simply being part of an alliance network is not sufficient to enable foreign investors to minimize behavioral uncertainty and thus significantly enhance their ability to select better local partners.

We focus on one form of international cluster, foreign peer network (FPN), which is formed by a group of foreign subsidiaries that are from the same home country and operate the same or similar businesses within a common geographic boundary in the host country. Driven by the various institutional, social and economic forces, a FPN develops through several distinctive stages, which in turn, partly explain variations in foreign subsidiary performance. Our analysis of 1,685 FPNs involving 26,439 Japanese foreign subsidiaries worldwide confirmed our arguments.

The results of the study show that there is a twofold influence of psychic distance, commitment, and firm experience. There is evidence that this relationship is an inverted u-curve. In addition, we found that competition in foreign target markets exerts a positive effect on the adaption of marketing strategies. The results confirm that psychic distance has an impact on all measured dimensions of export success in SMEs.

We note that firms with higher market orientation advantages tend to prefer hierarchical exporting channels while those with lower level market orientation advantages prefer hybrid channels.

We then examine how different governance types affect trade patterns among 44 countries representing 89 per cent of world trade.  We find that overall, rule-based countries trade more than relation-based or neither-based countries. A large positive effect on trade flows exists between two highly rule-based countries and between two relation-based countries. Any trade relationship involving a neither-based country negatively affects trade flows, even between two neither-based countries. Our study contributes to the trade literature by examining the effects of different types of governance environment on trade flows and more successfully explaining why some countries still trade almost nothing even after scholars and policy makers have convincingly proved all along that freer trade leads to higher welfare for a country.",governance environment| international trade| neither-based

Using a comprehensive cross-country dataset, I characterize how and why domestic political connections affect firms propensities to cross-list securities abroad. Connected firms have better access to foreign capital markets; moreover, the effect of connections is magnified for firms located in countries with weak property rights. Hence, domestic political connections, at the firm-level, serve as a strategic substitute for strong national property rights protections. This paper extends the interdisciplinary literature on political influence, institutions, and finance, as its findings require us to update our understanding from existing single-country studies: (i) political connections matter not only in domestic financial markets, but also in foreign financial markets; and, (ii) the primary reason politically connected firms receive better access to finance is not government-ownership or coercion of domestic banks, but rather implicit firm-level property rights protections that reduce privileged firms risk premiums vis-a-vis unconnected peers.",cross-listing| political connections| property rights

We challenge this assumption by investigating both market-based (e.g. secrecy, lead time) as well as legal knowledge protection strategies (e.g. patents, trademarks) of MNC subsidiaries. We argue that these strategies are endogenously determined by the subsidiary mandate and exogenously by the opportunities and challenges of the host country. We hypothesize that competence creating mandates increase the importance of legal knowledge protection while competence exploiting ones lead to market-based knowledge protection. Besides, technologically leading host country industries can be expected to provide opportunities for knowledge sourcing which may benefit from reciprocity. The latter can be signaled through lower levels of knowledge protection. However, the importance of legal knowledge protection may increase if key employees have multiple job opportunities in technologically leading host country regions.

To remedy this problem, interclusteral alliances have emerged as an important phenomenon in which local clusters establish formal alliances with other clusters based in foreign countries.

Nova de Lisboa||3|Patricia Jardim Da Palma|ISPA||,,"Current theories on economic growth are stressing the important role of creativity and innovation as a main driver of regional development. Some perspectives, like Richard Floridas creative class theory, have elected tolerance and diversity as a core concept in explaining differential development between different places, but his assumptions are challenged by other empirical and theoretical studies. In this article, we raise the possibility that tolerance is a necessary yet not a sufficient ingredient to trigger economic development in regions, and explore the role of subjective well-being (life-satisfaction, happiness and optimism) as a moderator. Using a nationwide survey of 3.757 respondents from 21 different Municipalities, the results show that optimism played the role of moderator, thus evidencing that psychological variables should be taken into account when trying to understand regional economic development.",creative class| tolerance| life-satisfaction

Nova de Lisboa||,,"The authors use threat-rigidity and organizational learning theories to analyze firm reaction to performance change in foreign markets. Based on survey data from exporting firms, the findings indicate that firms are more likely to change their international strategy when performance declines. Specifically, in low competitive markets, firms tend to react to performance decline by adapting their strategy to the foreign market, whereas in more competitive markets, firms tend to react by standardizing their strategy. Thus, depending on competitive circumstances, both threat-rigidity and organizational learning theories may apply. These theories should be regarded as complements to each other, not as alternatives.",organizational learning| adaptation/standardization| international management

Role of the Control Structure in Virtual Teams,1|Liz Lee-Kelley|Cranfield School of Management||,,"This qualitative study examined the role of the control structure as a channel for high reliability performance in I/S virtual teams. Although the high reliability organisations literature has provided a number of desirable high reliability qualities, it is vague about how they are to be developed and implemented successfully at task group and individual levels. A single case study comprising three independent project teams was used to illuminate the effects of formal and informal control mechanisms on teams ability to demonstrate consistent quality performance. The findings suggest that organisational tendency for an uniform control structure fails to account for context-specific task natures and dependencies, technical difficulties, interactive complexities and personal preferences, thus making it inadequate for reliable delivery. Additional findings indicate that members satisfaction and commitment are powerful high reliability drivers which should be recognised and harnessed. Implications for practice include providing a control structure that can balance compliance and volitional behaviour with the situated context for successful high reliability performance.",virtual teams| high reliability organisations| control structure

However, drawing on social network as well as transaction cost theory I show that governance structures in firm-driven open source projects seem to be far away from the purely altruistic approach open source is prominent for. Especially the presence of multiple firms in open source projects, like in the case of open source software foundations, shows similarities with governance modes to be found in classical R&D consortia. A data set with 109 projects and 110 participating firms act as a basis to test five hypotheses combining leadership structures and network positions with whether or not a person is sponsored by a firm.",open source| r&d alliance| social network analysis

Ferrante|U.S. Air Force Academy||,,"We develop and test a theoretical model of information security program effectiveness in organizations.  Specifically, our model depicts how top management support and security awareness serve as predictors for information security program effectiveness.  The model further explains how an organizations security culture partially mediates the relationship between the two exogenous, predictor variables and security program effectiveness.  We then investigate the moderating effect of task interdependence by testing the entire model in both high and low task interdependence environments.  We found a significant, positive relationship between security culture and security program effectiveness only under low task interdependence.  Moreover, we found significant, positive relationships between top management support and security program effectiveness and between user awareness and security program effectiveness only under high task interdependence.  Our findings highlight the important moderating effect that task interdependence has on the management of information security programs in organizations which suggests practical implications on what organizations should emphasize in managing such programs.",information security program effectiveness| task interdependence| top management support

Questions concerning global standardization and local adaptation across borders have become ever more important. This study investigates the phenomenon of interaction in intercultural communication through the study of a Danish company reestablishing a subsidiary in Japan. The study explores the interface view of micro processes and perceptions between headquarters and subsidiary communication in intercultural encounters at global, national, professional and personal levels of interaction. These levels include global strategies and their implementation in national cultures, professional aspects of communication concerning the organization of communication as well as task related intercultural issues. The perspective of negotiated culture is used to exemplify cultural processes of change (on larger or smaller scales) in interaction between communication practitioners in the two countries.

However, there appear to be important gaps in our understanding of the negative implications of being connected to work through technology after regular office hours (e.g. Blackberries, laptops).  This phenomenon, which we label staying connected, is suggested to have potential legal implications.  We show that it also has implications for employee well-being, and as a result, the potential to affect organizational performance. In this paper, we introduce an extension to Katz and Kahns (1978) Role Episode Model to address intentionality of sent messages, and accuracy of received messages. We use the extension in developing our Technology/Stress Model that hypothesizes relations between staying connected and role overload, role ambiguity, role conflict, and unnecessary stress.  We supplement our model with a proposed set of conditions under which staying connected to work can increase these generally negative outcomes and illustrate our hypotheses with situational examples.  Important implications suggest managers may wish to be more mindful of creating unnecessary stress' for employees who stay connected. Finally, suggestions for future research into this real life phenomenon are presented.",technology| unintended messages| unnecessary stress

Nova de Lisboa||,,"Organizations rely on unprescribed work to achieve their prescribed goals. When that work is complex enough to require an information system to coordinate it across time, how is that information system created and maintained? The curent literature on coordination in organizations suggests that employees improvise on their prescribed information system and on their prescribed work prioritization rules. But what if the information system is closely scrutinized and if there prioritization rules available are not adequate for employees unprescribed work? This was the case at DeskSales, where employees prescribed role was that of a salesperson, although employees spent most of their time doing service work. To coordinate their unprescribed service work, Desk Salespeople improvised three artifacts: to-do lists, to-do piles, and running logs. They used these artifacts to keep track of their outstanding unprescribed service work and to scaffold the memory of the information needed to carry out that work. Desk Salespeoples experience in coordinating their unprescribed work suggests that an organization may have a shadow, invisible information system used for work running in paralell with its prescribed information system used to create a facade of compliance.",coordination| unprescribed work| information systems

The study involved eight case studies of firms in knowledge-intensive industries. Knowledge was shown to be an important firm resource and dynamic knowledge capabilities were a key mechanism for bringing strategy to bear. Information systems strategy had a lesser effect than knowledge strategy. The highest performance impact was from the dynamic knowledge capability focused on the creation of new knowledge.",dynamic knowledge capabilities| information systems strategy| knowledge strategy
