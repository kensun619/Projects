1162,,1|Biocracy and the Informalization of Exploitation at Work,1|Peter Fleming|Queen Mary U. of London||,,"Drawing on the idea of bio-power from wider social theory, this paper will demonstrate how life itself (bios) is now a crucial resource enlisted by capitalism. The informal economy inside and outside the firm are critical for this new mode of exploitation. To explain this, the concept of biocracy is introduced to demonstrate how the informal subcultures, social intelligence and personal attributes of workers are currently being put to work. All that Fordism once feared is now the medium of a new form of exploitation. But as life itself is colonized in ever more expansive ways, resistance appears once again. A new political landscape has crystallized transforming the old tension between capital and labour into one between capital and life. Its manifesto is defined not by the demand for more, less or fairer work, but the end of work.",informal| power| exploitation

While it is often portrayed as fun, pleasure or a vocation, it is hardly ever described as labour (Abrams, 1953). Yet in todays aesthetic economy, the conception of artistic work is blurring (Bohme, 2003; Entwistle, 2002). The promise of non-alienated and free work (Marx, 1975) does not hold. Instead, a new form of labour, artistic labour, is emerging. To illustrate this point, we draw on qualitative data from ongoing research at a North American supermarket chain. We show how the making of store art turns out to be a production job: routine artwork that is instrumentalized, commoditized, and economized. In neo-liberal capitalism, so-called creative and artistic work involves many elements of traditional manufacturing labour. We discuss the similarities between artistic labour and aesthetic labour and argue that the benefit of employing artists is not only to have store art that improves sales and consumption. It also provides the supermarket chain with a greater aesthetic branding that responds to consumers alleged demand for beauty in the context of an increasingly aesthetic-driven economy (Bohme, 2003; Calkins, 1927; Postrel, 2003). Not price, but aesthetics and design create product differentiation and thus a competitive advantage. This is a manifestation of recent changes in the ideology of capitalism.",studies of work| aesthetic economy| creative work

Defining a sociological paradigm for this movement, we argue that its organizational research can be characterised as ontologically relativist, epistemologically relationist, and methodologically reflexive; this also represents research that is frequently deconstructionist in accounting for human nature.  When this paradigm is explored further, in terms of Burrell and Morgans assumptions about the nature of society"", two research domains are charted - normative post-structural and critical post-structural.  Assessing the forms of organizational analysis practiced within these domains - and focusing on developments in Actor-Network Theory in particular - we demonstrate how post-structural and postmodern research can be classified within, rather than outside of, or after, the Burrell and Morgan model.  The paper suggests, further, that revisiting the Burrell and Morgan thesis will help researchers to comprehend relationships between theoretical assumptions, methodological approaches, and the making of research choices.  As such, it facilitates appreciation that all knowledge stands on meta-theoretical premises.",paradigms| actor-network theory| burrell & morgan

Using the concepts of hegemony and performativity, we analyze the politics of language and representation in the BOP discourse, examining the ways in which the BOP discourse conceives of poor people as self-interested consumers and producers, in an effort to incorporate them into global capitalism.  Drawing on theories from postcolonialism, feminism, and post-structuralism, we develop an analysis of the ways in which the BOP discourse obscures non-capitalist alternatives and resistance to capitalism.

Using a psychoanalytic lens  one that so far has been neglected in portrayals of emotional well-being within educational practice - we analyse the ways by which pedagogic change can result in heightened student anxieties and the consequences of this for student learning. We argue that anxiety and tension are essential for learning; the anxiety associated with learning can stimulate meaningful and reflexive outcomes but learning inaction (Vince, 2008) is also possible. This has important implications for teacher education and academic formation processes. The study shows the negative consequences for effective educational practice if tutors are unable to provide a sufficient holding environment; or containment of anxieties arising from the teaching and learning experience  especially when these become too hard for some students to contain.",emotion| psychoanalysis| higher education

Interviews with 50 professional and academic personnel, including senior university management reveal an existing tension between competing claimants for university funds.

Ethnographic research shows how students were enlisted by university administrators to develop marketing plans for  promoting their region to the best and brightest young professionals. As part of the project, the students themselves were also targeted as future young professionals and judged by local corporate and government leaders on their merits as potential employees; those from more the more prestigious university were judged favorably while others, from lower-ranked colleges with high populations of first-generation college students, were not. Institutional ethnographic methods allowed us to connect the students classroom activities to the global war for talent and activities of regional economic development. The universitys paradoxical role in the war for talent is highlighted: while universities ostensibly provide the education necessary to allow future knowledge workers to participate in the meritocratic talent war, they also exacerbate existing class inequalities by creating new means for differentiating future winners from losers.

Philosophers of science argue that a posteriori (accommodated) hypotheses constrict theoretical progress through increased levels of overfitting and overly complex theories. As a proxy, we conducted a content analysis to investigate the extent to which research findings vary as a function of how they are hypothesized to be related in published reports. Specifically, we analyzed 268 published effect sizes of eight common bivariate relations reported in Journal of Applied Psychology and Personnel Psychology between 1980 and 2010. We extracted information on the variable pairs hypothesis frames within each paper (e.g., no hypothesis; main effect; incremental variance), and we conducted a series of meta-analyses to investigate the relation between hypothesis framing and reported effect size. Within the eight relations, we observed that mean correlations were substantially larger when the variable pairs were hypothesized to be related (r = .20) compared to when the pairs were not hypothesized to be related (r = .11).

Starbuck|U. of Oregon||,,"This paper builds on a discussion in the 1960s among agricultural economists about the value of baseline models for research investigations. Meaningful baseline models can both raise the theoretical and practical relevance of empirical research and help researchers to develop better theories. Because the 1960 debate focused on research about a developing economy, this paper investigates the use of baseline models in empirical studies of developing economies and emerging markets. However, we have looked at research in other topics and we are confident that the patterns described here have been occurring throughout the social sciences and business studies.Our investigation reveals more frequent use of baseline models, especially since 2000. We attribute this trend to several potential advantages: (1) Baseline models can raise the standards for identifying substantively important findings. (2) Baseline models can help researchers identify defects in their explanatory theories. (3) A sequence of baseline models can progress, step by step, from a more naive understanding toward more comprehensive understanding of studied phenomena. (4)  Baseline models challenge the notion that researchers ought to only ""test"" their explanatory theories and instead encouraging researchers to learn more and to create better theories. The fundamental nature of these advantages strongly suggests that baseline models deserve more serious attention outside of the field of emerging market research.",hypothesis testing| theory development| baseline models

But recent criticism suggests that such analyses in designs that do not experimentally manipulate the mediator variable may be flawed. Given that much of management research is observational, we offer a conceptual refinement of mediation that allows embracing the criticism within the constraints of the field. We take a counterfactual approach to mediation, and ask what would happen to the outcome if the mediator is changed through an intervention. By carefully considering the potential answers to this hypothetical question we differentiate two nuanced types of mediation, which we term descriptive and explanatory. These types are linked to the concept of descriptive and explanatory theories. We discuss the conceptual and theoretical implications of this distinction and suggest a method for discerning between the two types that is applicable to observational data.",path dependency| causality| mediation

Drawing on the resource-based view of the firm, we argue that reputation is an important resource of PSFs and impacts the degree and the direction of their diversification. We test our arguments using a sample of 326 firm-year observations of 50 large and medium-size PSFs active in Germany. Our results confirm the significance of reputation as a driver of firm diversification. Furthermore, we find that a PSFs decision which service lines to enter depends on the reputation of related business lines the firm is already active in.",diversification| reputation| professional service firms

The research context is the professional service firms (PSFs) where work done by teams requires effective relationships to facilitate knowledge creation, exchange and combination. Based on the resource-based view of the firm, the positive links are proposed between relational routines, i.e. the informal practices allowing people to know each other and the organization, and the relational coordination, i.e. the timely, accurate and goals-sharing communication during interactions, with innovation. However, resources in themselves do not translate into valued firm outcomes - their effective use is required to do so (Barney & Arikan, 2001; Schultz, 1961; Sirmon, Hitt, & Ireland, 2007). Taking a dynamic theory perspective, I propose and investigate knowledge management capability as a mediator in the relationships of relational routines  innovation and relational coordination  innovation. Using data collected from 120 accounting firms in Ireland, the sufficient and consistent support was found for the proposed linkages model of relational routines -> relational coordination -> knowledge management capability -> innovation. It indicates that organizations that have more relational routines experience more effective relational coordination which in turn creates organizational knowledge management capability and then improve organizational innovation. The implications and limitations of the findings are discussed.",relationships| professional service firms| knowledge management capability

It involves converting themes uncovered through interviews with a cross section of organization employees into a tentative graphic depiction of these issues, followed by a feedback session involving inquiry, testing and confirmation, and a discussion of next steps focused on the underlying drivers of the issues identified. Successfully using the intervention requires that consultants adopt an authentic listening, non-expert mindset to create a partnership with members of the client organization that can illuminate deeper organizational issues.

Data gathered from 25 UK managers (representing 15 organizations) contribute substantially to this exploratory study. Three overarching issues emerged from an analysis of the data: (1) middle managers feel uncertain while having to show certainty about change; (2) leading change from the middle is prone to ambivalent authorization; and, (3) middle managers are expected to implement change without knowing how to intervene in the complex practical, emotional and political dynamics interwoven with attempts to lead change. The authors summarize two contributions to knowledge. Firstly, an understanding of collective emotions at work is shown to be important to middle managers potential effectiveness as internal change agents. Secondly, this pilot research begins a process of generating insights about some specific emotional and political dynamics that constrain and enable middle managers purposive action on leading change.

One option to effect these changes is to engage a consulting service firm to help internalize any new information that they may receive by incorporating them into their existing operations.  While scholars have investigated the processes by which consultants and clients function in addition to the considerable research on how professional service firms themselves ought to be organized, there has been limited empirical analysis of what kind of firms hire consultants.  We survey 277 firms to address this important question and preliminary results suggest that firms that have a higher level of absorptive capacity are more likely to hire a consultant to internalize any new information they receive, which goes against the grain of extant thinking that those firms with limited knowledge assets would seek external help.",consulting service firms| knowledge internalization| absorptive capacity

However, as a large part of a consulting projects success and value creation depends on the cooperation and alignment of expectations in the early purchasing phases, the formalization has been criticized for being too goods-oriented and not taking service characteristics into account. This paper explores how organizations deal with these conflicting demands by investigating the purchasing logics consultants, purchasing professionals and clients express. By drawing on qualitative interviews and observation it is shown that purchasing professionals express a transactional logic and consultants a relational logic, thus creating a situation of inter-organizational misalignment and risk of lower value creation. The clients however express both logics, thereby increasing the risk for intra-organizational misalignment, internal conflicts and maverick buying. The duality of logics enables clients to have an important role as weight in the organization, who by their actions can help reduce or increase the misalignments.",management consulting| purchasing| logics

Based on a content analysis of the HRM articles published on diversity from 2000-2011, as well as global demographic and political trends, we speculate on what the next era of diversity in HRM may bring.  In sum, this paper reflects upon the critical turns of the 20th and beginning of the 21st centuries as a means of summarizing the evolution of research and practice on workplace racioethnic diversity.",diversity| race| history

Our results show that while participation in global resource and product markets independently influence investments in innovation, product market internationalization mediates the relationship between resource accumulation and investment in innovation. In other words, firms use international resources to pursue product market internationalization, and it is a combination of technology acquisition and experiential knowledge from global markets that provides the impetus for investment in innovation. This supports recent articulations in the literature regarding the importance of both external knowledge accumulation and assimilation as drivers of innovation for developing economy firms.  We further theorize and find support for the conditioning role of business group affiliation on the relationship between sources of knowledge and innovation orientation.

This extends the attention-based and knowledge-based views by emphasizing headquarters role in innovation transfers in a model tested on a sample of 169 innovation transfer projects. The results indicate that gaining headquarters involvement and attention during transfers is contingent on the innovations being complex and the subsidiary classifying the innovations as important. By involving itself in transfer projects, headquarters actively orchestrates innovations with specific attributes within the multinational enterprise and thereby also allocates its attention to selected innovation transfer projects within the organization. This study contributes to the understanding of when headquarters considers specific transfer projects interesting, thus attracting its strategic support. This explains attention allocation determinants and precursors to innovation orchestration in networked organizations.",headquarters| attention| mne

I also suggest that negative (positive) emotions would mediate this relationship, such that quality feedback would lead to less negative (more positive) affect, which would then result in higher performance. Both the employee performance appraisal comments and manager feedback were coded for a sample of 1,019 Clinical Nurses.

The results from a survey of 151 service and manufacturing firms provide partial support for this notion and show that employee turnover impacts these organizations differently.  More specifically, we find that: 1) the impact of non-manager employee turnover on firm performance is greater in service settings than in manufacturing settings; 2) the impact of non-manager employee turnover on firm performance is greater than the performance impact of manager turnover in service firms; and 3) manager and non-manager employee turnover are unrelated to firm performance in manufacturing settings.

Mentor commitment exhibited a positive relationship with mentoring effectiveness as rated by ones supervisor, when high levels of mentoring aptitudes or attributes (i.e., leader-member exchange, political skill, self-monitoring, strategic outlook, and learning goal orientation) conducive to effective mentoring were present. Conversely, effectiveness of mentors who displayed high mentor commitment was lower when these mentor attributes were deficient.",mentor commitment| mentor effectiveness| mentor attributes

Major shortfalls are anticipated in public pension programs due to an aging populace and the shift to defined contribution programs. As a potential solution to this problem, we analyze the role of HR in organizational retirement systems. The HR Department plays a pivotal role in employee retirement planning, choosing the retirement plan options for the organization and orienting employees to them. To illustrate shortcomings in this process, a seven year case study of a university retirement system is presented. This case study has evolved into an examination of the HR fields approach to managing retirement programs.  	Unfortunately, the typical HR professional lacks the incentive, knowledge base, and tools to manage programs well. There is little financial incentive for effective retirement program management. In addition, federal legislation (e.g., ERISA) discourages active involvement.  Financial planning is not part of the traditional HR education and credentialing process. Inadequate tools are available to assess performance of defined contribution retirement programs.	We conducted an exploratory study to assess the current state of retirement planning. As expected, 1) most companies outsource management of retirement benefits, 2) companies choose service providers mainly because of management information system, reputation, and cost, 3) benefits specialists perceive that services providers vary in quality and question whether those providers can be trusted, and 4) HR perceives that employees are primarily responsible for their education and asset management, but the employer also bears responsibility.",benefits| retirement crisis| behavioral finance

We argue that the adoption of employee stock incentives depends on the likelihood of rent generation or rent appropriation as perceived by the decision makers of a firm.  Since the strategic decision making rights of a firm are rooted in the corporate governance mechanisms, this paper tries to clarify the link between the adoption decision of employee stock incentives with several important mechanisms of corporate governance, such as ownership structure (insider ownership, institutional investor, family owner), board size, and CEO duality.  The empirical findings based on a panel dataset having 3139 observations of Taiwanese high technology firms generally support that corporate governance mechanisms impact the diffusion of employee stock incentives within these firms.  Management and institutional owners generally hold the view that employee stock incentives can help firms to achieve a rent generation mechanism; on the other hand, family owners seem to believe employee equity compensation encourages the less benign rent appropriation.",corporate governance| rent appropriation| employee stock incentives

We address this by conducting a detailed exploratory case study of the current state of HR professionalization in Canada, guided by the theoretical frameworks of the trait and control models.

Further, data showing employer demand for the national-level HR certification suggest that these professionalization strategies have been somewhat successful thus far. We also present evidence suggesting that the profession has achieved some confirmation of legitimacy from post-secondary institutions and government.

Recent work (Chen & Mathieu, 2008; Yeo & Neal, 2004) suggests that these predictors may have important within-individual effects on learning. That is, the slope of performance across multiple episodes also varies as a function of GMA and LGO. The current study tests the between- and within-individual effects of GMA and LGO in an applied student sample (N(between-persons)=301, N(within-persons)=1505) over 1 semester in an introductory management course. Using random coefficient longitudinal growth modeling (Bliese & Ployhart, 2002), we find that GMA and LGO operate at both the between- and within-person levels in predicting learning performance. Additionally, our data show that the effects of GMA and LGO are partially mediated by metacognitive activity. Finally, we find that GMA moderates the time-learning curve such that the gap between high-GMA individuals and low-GMA individuals widened by 300% over the course of the semester.

The change involved did not primarily or initially come from the employer, but rather was proposed by an external influence, in this case the union, which also helped implement it. The change also modified the organizational hierarchy in the workplace by instituting a new bargaining unit position between the employees and their supervisors. Using social exchange and commitment theories as our conceptual framework, we developed and tested hypotheses concerning the impact of union commitment, both directly and incrementally, over affective organizational commitment, on employee change acceptance. We also hypothesized that supervisory support would moderate the relationship between union commitment and change acceptance; such that relationship would be strongest when supervisory support is the lowest. We also addressed the research question of whether change acceptance and perceived change benefits were related. All hypotheses were supported, and while not the subject of a hypothesis, affective organizational commitment did not significantly predict change acceptance. Not surprisingly, change acceptance and perceived change benefits were positively related.

Using a longitudinal survey conducted by the government sponsored research institution over 653 Korean firms, the results show that war for talent does not have a significant impact on firm performance. However, findings indicate a negative relationship between war for talent practices and financial performance (productivity and ROA) when conducting layoffs, and a positive effect of the interaction between war for talent and layoff on turnover as expected. Lastly, the results indicate layoffs may be tolerable within firms pursuing i?1/2i?1/2war for talentsi?1/2i?1/2 as long as investments in employee developments are continued during layoff periods.",talent management| layoffs| employee development

Further, signaling theory posits that specific information will be used to fill in other gaps in information. In this study, we propose and test the hypothesis that a more specific reward proposition in a job advertisement will lead to perceptions of higher person-reward fit and subsequent pursue intention. Further, the person-reward fit will allow participants to make inferences about their person-organization fit. Using data from an online experiment with 282 participants, we find evidence that more specific reward propositions are indeed positively related to pursue intentions and that this relationship is fully mediated by person-reward fit perceptions. In turn, the effect of person-reward fit is partially mediated by perceptions of person-organization fit, indicating that people use reward information as signals for other organizational attributes in the early stages of recruitment.",recruitment| rewards

Evidence from a longitudinal study on a sample of job seekers suggests that expected need fulfillment and future opportunities for value expression offered the most viable explanations of value congruence effects.

Finally, using both demographic and occupational commitment variables, the profiles of pursuing and non-pursuing subsamples of professionals are compared.  Results showed that the main motivation for certification was intrinsic development, followed by extrinsic rewards and social pressures.  The main reason why professionals did not pursue PHR certification was a perceived lack of value; the main reason why professionals chose not to pursue SPHR certification was the perceived time requirements.

Any person who works with at least one other person in a business arrangement, needs to find a way to staff the business, provide some rewards to retain people, divide tasks to be done and to coordinate all work into a common goal. I propose that management control theory provides a constructive perspective that enables comparisons about how small firms deal with the functional requirements of HRM. Variation in HRM can be discerned along three dimensions of management control: the level of formalization, the amount of hierarchy, and the relative emphasis on people or output. By creating archetypes based on the extremes of these three dimensions, a typology of small firm HRM appears that captures variation as wide as sweatshop like employment arrangements, to informal alliances or partnerships, up to strategic entrepreneurs that aim at future growth. The value of this approach is that it uses a flexible definition of HRM, such that it includes all kind of more informal employment arrangements (typical for small firms) that would perhaps drop out of the scope of HRM research when only formal organizations are looked into.",hrm| functional equivalents| small firms

While many of these firms are relying on High Commitment Work Practices (HCWPs) to enhance critical employee behaviors such as service quality and turnover, the analysis presented in this paper raises questions about traditional understandings of commitment in professional service environments. In particular, data from three Danish financial investment PSFs suggest that employees are more committed to developing and promoting their own professions than to the organization itself, which has important implications for the way in which HCWPs are designed and utilized. In addition, the focus of HCWP research has favored the use of social exchange theory as an underpinning framework for considering the impact of HR practices on employee commitment. In the context of PSFs, we question the applicability of social exchange theory and instead draw upon the Ability-Motivation-Opportunity (AMO) framework (1982) to analyze how specific HRM practices contribute to the development of commitment, and to successful organizational outcomes in PSFs.",high commitment work practices| professional service firms| amo framework

In the first experiment (n=241) distinctiveness as the most important dimension in the attribution process was manipulated with two conditions (negative versus positive). The results showed that positive distinctiveness strengthened the relationship between high commitment HRM and employee outcomes.

On five consecutive days employees reported their job conditions (job demands, job resources) and work experiences (work engagement and exhaustion) right after work, while they reported their affective states (positive and negative affect) at home before going to sleep. Partners rated the daily family quality. The results showed that hindrance demands had mainly detrimental consequences on family quality, while partners rated the quality of family interactions higher when employees had experienced more challenge demands and more job resources at work. The process whereby daily job conditions affect daily family quality could be partially ascribed to the spillover of affective states from work to the family domain.

One explanation for inconsistencies is that there is a substantial amount of heterogeneity, rather than homogeneity, within each group of workers (part-time and full-time). To help explain these differences, researchers have created a part-time worker typology (Martin & Sinclair, 2007) based on various demographics and personal life roles. Subsequently, differences between the derived groups of part-time workers on attitudes and behaviors were established (Senter & Martin, 2007; Wittmer & Martin, 2011a; 2011b).  Using three different samples to establish a base for its generalizability, the current study expands this typology to full-time workers.

Hierarchical linear modeling was used to explore the role of shared task interdependence as a moderator of the relationship between telecommuting and individual performance, and the role of normative telecommuting (i.e., the proportion of telecommuters within the group) as a moderator of the relationship between telecommuting and individual performance, job satisfaction, affective commitment, and work/life conflict.  We surveyed 216 skilled and unskilled employees in 41 work groups in a call-center environment using employee performance data from the organization.  Results show that telecommuters are lower performers in groups with higher levels of shared task interdependence; this performance decrement disappears as shared task interdependence within the group decreases.  We also find that non-telecommuters perform higher in groups with fewer telecommuters, but that these performance differences disappear as groups incorporate more telecommuters.  Furthermore, individual job satisfaction and commitment increase, while work/family conflict decreases for both telecommuters and non-telecommuters as groups incorporate more telecommuters.  These findings provide insight into how telecommuting can be managed at the group level for the benefit of telecommuters as well as non-telecommuters.",telecommuting| distributed work| task interdependence

Such analyses revealed that both types of turnover had different consequences. Voluntary turnover was unrelated to store performance. Otherwise, involuntary turnover was significantly and negatively related both to store productivity and efficiency when variables are measured simultaneously, though this effect disappears in a one-month time lag. These results are discussed in the context of operational disruption arguments, and reveal the importance of using distinct variables that isolate the nature of employeesi?1/2 separations (voluntary or involuntary) for the purposes of understanding what is meant by the functionality of turnover.

We integrate the management literature on voluntary resignations and the communication literature on relationship dissolution to explore how conversations between an exiting employee and his or her manager facilitate (or constrain) post-exit relationships.  Employees who had recently resigned from full-time jobs described their exit experiences in semi-structured interviews with the research team.  The results suggest two dominant patterns.  When employees exited for external reasons (e.g., to pursue a program of study), they engaged in very direct communication strategies, elicited positive responses from their managers, and left with high interest in a post-exit relationship.  But when employees exited for internal reasons (dissatisfaction with the job), they engaged in multiple exit cycles and moved from indirect communication strategies toward increasingly direct ones. Managerial responses to these strategies failed to capitalize on opportunities to nurture post-exit relationships and sometimes generated a vendetta effect among exiting employees.  The results suggest that managers might benefit from training in how to conduct effective exit conversations, particularly with employees who are leaving for internal reasons.",turnover| communication| interviews

By examining the relationships of the changes in CEO cash compensation and new option grants under different market conditions, we found strong supports for the contracting view that firms increase new option grants following stock price decline only during the economic recession. We do not find the same relationship in the normal economic period. Besides, we do not find any evidence that firms increased cash compensation following the stock price decline and CEO wealth loss. These findings are inconsistent with what the rent-extraction view predicts that powerful and entrenched CEOs will be compensated for their wealth loss even when they are responsible for the poor firm performance.",ceo compensation| underwater options| firms' responses

Over the last few decades, the issues of executive pay dispersion and its performance implication have been a key research topic. However, previous studies have paid little attention to the role of compensation committee regarding executive pay dispersion.  Social comparison theory and institutional theory suggest that committee members on corporate board show mimetic behaviors when making decisions on executive pay structure.  Specifically, we propose that compensation committees are likely to create similar level of pay dispersion for focal firm (i.e. where committee member as serve directors) that mirrors the pay dispersion of tied firm (i.e. where committee member serve as managers). We also propose that the executive pay dispersion before financial crisis had negative performance implications. Using a sample of U.S. banks, we found that the pay dispersion level of tied firms is positively associated with that of focal firm when committee members have significant tenure as a director. In addition, we found that executive pay dispersion is negatively associated with future financial performance.  This study opens up a new perspective on the role of the compensation committee as the catalyst in the diffusion of executive pay dispersion across firms as well as its performance implications around the recent financial crisis.",firm performance| executive pay dispersion| compensation committee

Global leaders who successfully work across borders are considered to have a high level of cultural intelligence (often referred to as CQ). Cultural Intelligence (CQ) refers to an individuals capacity to function and manage effectively in culturally diverse settings. The main research question in this study seeks to determine if there is a link between cultural intelligence (CQ) and effective global leadership. In addition, we assess whether the four components of cultural intelligence (CQ) are equally important. We also examine the impact of cultural distance on the link between cultural intelligence (CQ) and effective global leadership. 	The findings of this study indicate that there is a positive link between CQ and effective global leadership. Individuals who have high CQ are also effective in their global leadership roles. However, the data indicates that CQ is a complex and multi dimensional construct and all components of CQ are not equally important for effective global leadership.

Our findings show that corporate ROI is perceived by expatriate employees to be predominantly linked to turnover intentions; thus, retention activities dominate the findings in terms of highlighting which combination of factors strengthen expatriates psychological contract and commitment to their employer and which factors lead them to seek out external employment opportunities. Our findings further suggest that varying degrees of job mobility preparedness arises out of a tendency towards a self-initiated career orientation, but contend that when and where it shows up is contingent on a range of push and pull factors that combine to impact on psychological contract fulfillment and job embeddedness as facilitators of organizational commitment.

Throughout the process, called internationalization of the second degree, the study focuses on how and where in the MNC peripheral internationalization opportunities are identified and for what reasons extended geographical responsibility is granted to foreign subsidiaries. Multiple case-study research reveals that for internationalization of the second degree the locus of knowledge accumulation and dissemination may be set at geographically and institutionally dispersed locations. Furthermore, it shows that foreign subsidiaries receive extended geographical responsibility, if they are equipped with country-specific advantages (CSAs) that are non-location bound and that facilitate the process of obtaining foreign market insidership. Accounting for multiple embeddedness of foreign subsidiaries and intra-MNC competition, such host market CSAs need to be distinct and superior to elsewhere in the organization. Finally, the subsidiarys value proposition for foreign market development must be sufficient to offset potential risk increases associated with responsibility delegation by corporate management.",internationalization process| subsidiary roles| subsidiary initiative

Yet, few studies have empirically examined the logic lying behind choosing SAS vs. traditional OFDI by emerging economy enterprises. Our study theorizes and examines the impact of internal capability-absorptive capacity and external context-industry openness on the propensity of emerging economy enterprises (EEEs) to engage in strategic asset-seeking OFDI vs. traditional FDI. Our findings show that both internal and external factors exert remarkable impacts on the EEEs!- choice of SAS FDI. Strong absorptive capacity enables EEEs to engage in SAS FDI and high degree of industry openness motivates EEEs to engage in SAS FDI.

Viewing outward FDI by EM MNEs as an important catch-up strategy, we propose that EM MNEs are attracted to host countries with comparative technology advantages in the industries relevant to the investor. We further propose that inward FDI in emerging markets, by generating knowledge spillovers in the relevant industries, also provides important sources of technological knowledge for EM MNEs to acquire and can slow the rate of entry of EM MNEs into foreign countries for knowledge seeking purposes. Using a dataset of the overseas investment activities of over 400 Chinese manufacturing firms in the last two decades, we find strong support for our hypotheses. Our results also suggest that despite some overlap between inward and outward FDI in providing learning opportunities to emerging market firms, outward FDI provides additional knowledge benefits that may not be readily available in domestic markets.

However, R&D investment is one of several ways to enhance technological capabilities. When there are other sources of knowledge available, exporters!- tendency to invest in R&D may be weakened. In the paper, three other sources of knowledge are identified: 1) multinational corporations (MNC) as customers, 2) MNCs as parents, and 3) FDI in a local industry. An analysis on 5,595 automobile parts and components manufacturers in China during 2005-2007 supports the above argument. In order to compete in overseas markets, Chinese automobile parts and components manufacturers!- tendency to invest in R&D initially increased as their export intensity is relatively low. When the export intensity exceeds a threshold, exporters acquire more advanced knowledge from their foreign customers, reducing their tendency to invest in R&D. When the exporters have foreign parents or the FDI intensity in the local industry is high, their tendency to invest in R&D stimulated by export is further reduced. Better intellectual property protection helps increase the likelihood of in-house R&D stimulated by export.",indigenous technological efforts| emerging economy| multinational corporation

Expatriates are often expected to facilitate this task. Since there are many challenges in working in foreign countries, people who share the ethnic identity (EHCNs) with host country employees (HCEs) are increasingly seen as ideal candidates for overseas assignments. However, conflicting evidence has been revealed concerning whether or not EHCNs are more effective than non-EHCN expatriates. To address this discrepancy, this article first distinguishes between cultural similarity and ethnic similarity, and points out that in many host countries of MNCs, ethnic similarity with HCEs forms a division between EHCNs and non-EHCNs. With a focus on ethnic similarity, it discusses the differences between surface- and deep-level ethnic similarity. This study then focuses on the divergent views of social categorization between EHCNs and HCEs that derives from this division. These are captured by the concept of ethnic identity confirmation, which is the degree of congruence between how individuals view the importance of their ethnic identity and how others view it. Finally, this study proposes a conceptual modal explaining the connection between ethnic identity confirmation and knowledge transfer. It argues that ethnic identity confirmation relates to knowledge transfer through trust and relationship conflicts. By focusing on ethnic identity confirmation, this study has applied a new mechanism to analyze social interactions between expatriates and HCEs. This focus also makes it possible to incorporate both the views of EHCNs and HCEs on ethnic identity in one study.Paper is No Longer Available Online: Please contact the author(s).",im division gustavson school of business award for the best qualitative paper in international business finalist

Based on an analysis of datasets of investments made over three decades, we demonstrate that the number of IJVs and the total FDI inflows increase as legal legitimacy (expressed as both BIT presence and BIT stringency) improves, but only in developing countries with high political risks. We contribute to research on the relationship between international strategy and international legal institutions by showing how the stringency of BIT design  a variable hitherto neglected  impacts FDI and how it has a greater impact on IJVs than the mere presence of BITs.",bilateral investment treaties| international joint ventures| fdi

Specifically, we identify ties with large multinational enterprises (MNEs) as an important but under-researched source of social capital for internationalization-seeking start-ups  in other words, aspiring INVs. Based on an inductive longitudinal case-study in Bangalore, India, our central argument is that an aspiring INV could build and leverage valuable MNE links through the interplay between their network actions and uncertainty reduction, which are engendered by the clarity of its strategic intent. Specifically, we identify the combined effects of network broadening actions and egocentric uncertainty reduction as potentially leading to the formation of an optimal partnering relationship with an MNE subsidiary. The combined effects of network deepening actions and altercentric uncertainty reduction potentially lead to the transformation of this local relationship into a globally embedded one involving the wider MNE. This, in turn, could lead to the MNE becoming a conduit for the new ventures international expansion.

The influence of dual embeddedness is examined in relation to a subsidiarys competence in operational efficiency, strategic influence, and international business opportunities. Structural equation modeling is used to analyze a data set that consists of 85 innovation development projects. The analysis reveals that internal embeddedness has positive effects for subsidiary competence creation related to strategic influence and international business opportunities. External embeddedness has positive effects on the subsidiarys competence creation in operational efficiency and strategic influence, but a negative effect on international business opportunities. These results elucidate the role of internal and external networks in innovation development and competence creation in subsidiaries of multinational enterprises.

Innovative geographic modeling of 626 Japanese MNE subsidiaries in 23 conflict-afflicted countries over 19862006 provides strong support for our arguments. Our findings suggest that valuable resources may become a firms Achilles heel in volatile environments, but that increased resilience is possible through the development of coping mechanisms.",political risk| exit| mnes

However, some recent studies have shown that firms in regulated sectors do not always avoid policy risk when expanding abroad, because these firms have capabilities that allow them to overcome the negative consequences of policy risk exposure. Building on these studies, this paper analyzes to what extent policy risk in the host country increases or decreases the probability of divesting. An empirical analysis based on survival models applied to a sample of foreign direct investments made by Spanish multinationals in regulated industries during the period 1986-2008 shows that, at least in the case of these firms, policy risk decreases the probability of divestiture.",policy risk| survival| political capabilities

Yet, the nature of business-government interactions in an era of increased economic competition and interconnectedness has changed.  This has greatly reduced the explanatory and predictive power of traditional theories of political risk based on factors such as bargaining power or structural attributes of political institutions.  In this paper, we examine the political risk faced by Google in China through the lens of both the traditional bargaining power approach as well as an emergent, legitimacy-based view, and find the latter perspective to better explain Googles experience.  Likewise, we find that Googles experience can be used to create testable propositions and further conceptual development of this legitimacy-based approach to political risk.",political risk| business-government relations| legitimacy

We draw on the configurational approach which conceptualizes corporate governance as a system of interrelated elements having strategic or institutional complementarities and claims that particular governance practices will only be effective in certain combinations which may lead to different corporate governance patterns. We claim that the relationship between boards and auditors is contingent on the ownership of the firm, and in particular on the degree of foreign ownership.  To test this logic, we focus on the relationship between board characteristics and audit fees in Japanan institutional setting which differs substantially from the U.S., and has witnessed a high increase in Anglo-American institutional investors. Our results show that board independence, as well as board of auditors independence and the external auditor are to some extent substitutes in Japanese listed firms with low levels of foreign ownership; however, this relationship becomes complementary when foreign ownership is high.

More specifically, though previous alliance studies investigated opportunistic propensity and suggested that cultural values may affect a managers likelihood to act opportunistically three issues permeate current literature: empirical tests are virtually absent, studies have primarily used country-level data, and studies tend to neglect the impact of situational factors. To address these issues, we collected survey data in the Netherlands and Turkey from alliance managers and empirically examine the moderating effect of individualism on the relationships between four exchange variables and opportunistic propensity. The results demonstrate that (1) the effects of economic dissatisfaction and alliance specific investments are stronger for managers with individualist values, whereas (2) the effects of social dissatisfaction and alternative attractiveness are stronger for mangers with collectivistic values. Thus, we advance the international strategic alliance literature by showing that opportunism possesses a similar meaning across the two countries, but in addition that opportunistic propensity is affected interactively by cultural values and exchange variables.",strategic alliances| opportunism| cultural values

Calhoun|Georgia Southern U.||2|Akhadian S Harnowo|Georgia Southern U.||,,"A critical commodity in international joint ventures (IJV) is knowledge. IJV success often hinges on internal knowledge transfer. However, trust is required for the freest flow of information and trust is more difficult across cultures. The first contribution of this paper is an explanation of the problem of trust in IJVs. The trust problem begins as an issue of balance. In some IJVs, partners bring to the venture knowledge with a similar level of value  both high or both low. There is a balance in the value of knowledge contributed. In many other IJVs, one partner contributes knowledge with a much higher value than the other partner. This imbalance creates an unequal need to be trusted. The IJV partner contributing knowledge with the least value needs to be trusted to gain full access to the valuable knowledge held by the other. Trust becomes the commodity used to access and promote full and complete internal transfer of knowledge. The second contribution of this paper concerns building trust with a partner from a different country. There is a liability of foreignness (LOF) that attaches to the partner who needs to build trust. That partner does not have complete knowledge of the other partners market and culture. This paper explores LOF as a tool for improved understanding of the complex issue of trust in IJVs. Interestingly, this portion of the analysis reveals that LOF is a problem that does not always or only attach to the foreign firm in the IJV.",international joint venture| trust| knowledge transfer

The results of this longitudinal study of 889 firms over 23 years (1986-2008) suggest that exploration activities assist long-term learning, by exposing the firm to richer experiences, although such learning only takes place over time.

This paper argues the firms competitive advantage, which is a result of access to the knowledge, networks, and resource, works as the moderating force determining the speed of expansion, together with the opportunity, enabling, motivating, and mitigating factors explained by Oviatt and McDougalls model. Further, it argues the timing decision is a decision variable that the firm can control, and is essentially a combination of the boundary and location decision.

This exploitation-focused argument demonstrates an incremental process of international expansion with the internationalization of mature multinational corporations (MNCs). However, the situation is different for international new ventures, which may not have sufficient resources and economies of scale in their domestic countries before starting operations in other countries. Moreover, after initial internationalization at a young age, international new ventures might choose to go to similar foreign markets to leverage and exploit existing knowledge for growth or they might continue experimenting with less related foreign markets. In this study, we propose that international new ventures benefit from using an ambidextrous strategy for long-term performance employing both exploitation and exploration. We argue that new ventures are able to develop international ambidexterity, defined as the capability to successfully balance international exploitation and exploration activities. This capability is founded on new ventures initial activities but needs to be further developed and refined through international operations with both incremental and radical approaches.",exploitation/exploration| international new venture| ambidexterity

We argue that in a large emerging economy such as China, this relationship does not need to be a linear one, and could be inverted-U shaped. Product innovation requires superior technological as well as market knowledge. Exporters in emerging economies, while are usually technology leaders in their domestic market, could be technology laggards in international markets. When the export intensity is low, the exporters still pay much attention to the domestic market and tend to make product innovation by combining their domestic market knowledge with superior technological capabilities gained from exporting. When export intensity exceeds a threshold, the exporters may shift their focus to overseas markets, where their competitive advantage might lie in efficient and quality manufacturing rather than in superior technological or market knowledge. This may prevent highly intensive exporters from investing in new product innovation. When domestic competition is high, less intensive exporters are more likely to make full use of the knowledge they gain through exporting and invest in product innovations to compete domestically. At the same time, intense domestic competition might push exporters to abandon product innovation quickly and focus more on efficient and quality production. An analysis on 6,197 firms in China's automobile industry during 2005-2007 supports the above argument.",export| market competition| product innovation

We investigate the influence of the four dimensions of an effectual internationalization approach (i.e. means-driven, affordable loss, partnerships and acknowledge the unexpected) on international performance of SMEs and how these relationships are contingent on foreign market dynamism. We test our hypotheses on a dataset of 191 German SMEs. We find that means-driven internationalization projects, partnerships, and the extent of acknowledging the unexpected have a significant positive direct effect on international performance of SMEs. Furthermore, we find that the influence of means-driven internationalization projects has a weaker influence on international performance of SMEs in dynamic foreign markets. Conversely, the influence of affordable loss and acknowledging the unexpected on international performance of SMEs enhances in more dynamic foreign markets. Our work contributes to the international entrepreneurship literature by linking effectuation logic, international performance, and foreign market dynamism to explain entrepreneurial internationalization of SMEs.",international performance| effectuation| internationalization process

A mixed methods approach was used to collect the data. Quantitative data collected from a survey of 194 Chinese employees were used to test the hypothesized relationships; qualitative data collected from interviews with 8 respondents were used to help explain the underlying logic behind the relationships. The results of the hypotheses testing show that employees perceived accuracy of performance appraisal is positively associated with the three types of justice and the two purposes of performance appraisal. The findings from the interviews indicate that employees perceptions of appraisal accuracy are influenced by certain Chinese cultural characteristics and management traditions.

This study explores the distinct roles of formal and informal institutional differences on the local legitimacy of foreign firms, and examines the performance effects of different types of legitimacy in a local market environment. The results suggest subtle effects on three key local legitimacy dimensions: while media endorsement of foreign firms is influenced by both formal and informal institutional differences, legal actions against these firms are particularly influenced by informal institutional differences, and their credit ratings by formal institutional differences. Such legitimacy consequences are important because they affect subsequent performance expectations when firms make large acquisitions in the local market.",legitimacy| institutional differences| mergers and acquisitions

However, despite the heap of studies on the phenomenon, the role of psychic distance has largely remained unexplored. Although previous research has tested the explanatory power of established theories and explanations for outward FDI by Chinese companies, a proper test of the psychic distance thesis that predicts firmsa preferences for investments in relatively similar countries to the home country has not been done. The aim of this paper is to emphasize the traditional role of psychic distance as an explanatory factor for the internationalization path of MNCs from developing countries and see to what extent it can explain the internationalization of Chinese MNCs. To test this, we use Chinese OFDI data between 2003-2009. In particular, we examine to what extent psychic distance in terms of differences in language, religion, culture, economic development, political systems, education, and geographic distance explain the investment behavior of Chinese companies. Our results clearly show that we cannot ignore psychic and cultural distance as explanations for Chinese OFDI.

To this perspective, we integrate extant research which suggests that attributes of the host country environment will impact entry timing as well.  Our findings support the argument that home country cultural attributes directly influence whether a firm decides to enter a country earlier or later than other firms, and that the host countrys political environment moderates these effects.  Specifically, we find that firms from high performance orientation and high power distance tend to enter countries earlier on average; we also find that countries with weak political freedoms trigger late-entry strategies from high uncertainty avoidance cultures, but early-entry strategies from collectivist cultures.

In such markets, characterized by volatile institutional settings, economic transformations, and high growth, the competitive advantage of subsidiaries of multinational enterprises is highly contingent upon their strategic ability to rapidly adapt to uncertain conditions by constantly revising product-market strategies as well as engaging in intensive informal relationship-building with market actors. Although such capabilities are often built as a reflection of the home country institutional context and utilized by subsidiaries in foreign markets, our knowledge of their institutional underpinning is scarce.

This paper analyzes how certain types of networks and institutions help emerging market firms learn and innovate, in turn shedding light on the interaction between local and imported innovative capacities as well as the distinction between learning discrete knowledge (know-that) and learning to learn through collaboration (know-how). From a Schumpeterian perspective, innovation is seen as the recombination of existing factors to provide novel solutions to old problems. Theoretically, firms with access to more and varied information will be more likely to innovate. The Argentinean wine industry provides a setting where the ability of firms to learn from others how to upgrade their capabilities (the innovation under study) can be assessed by studying the firm access to varied information, their absorptive capacity, and the social networks on which the firms are embedded. In ten years, capability upgrading grew the world market share of the sector to 3%. Our unique survey, covering 112 wineries, facilitates the study of how and when information heterogeneity promotes or hinders upgrading. Results show the moderating effect of firm size on information diversity driving innovation. They provide evidence that Public-private institutions are agents that act as processors of information, repository of knowledge for the firms, but also help firms to develop learning capabilities. In addition, they present a more nuanced view of absorptive capacity and its limitations to develop innovations by incorporating external information in poorly understand problems.",economic development| private private institutions| knowledge transfer

Following this paradigm, we investigate the role of network conditions and embedded competitive strategies in driving the global distribution of service delivery in the global services industry. Based on comprehensive data from the Offshoring Research Network, we show that managing time differences through global delivery models is a major driver of internationalizing operations in this industry. Providers from developed countries thereby respond to increasing global competitive pressures as well as clients interest in using qualified personnel from abroad. Providers from developing countries, in turn, internationalize to reduce time differences to clients and increase their overall global presence, which helps them stabilize client relationships, yet at the expense of margins. Our findings demonstrate the growing importance of global competitive dynamics, not least between developing and developed country firms, and the increasing role of global rather than domestic or regional client orientations in driving internationalization, in particular in business services.",internationalization| outsourcing| emerging economies

To address this gap, we provide a multilevel contingency perspective proposing that the timing of offshoring activities affects the degree of cost savings and that the relationship is contingent on activity and firm-level factors. Using data on 639 offshoring activities at 214 firms, we find evidence of an early-mover cost advantage in offshoring. In addition, we find that this relationship is stronger in the case of labor rather than knowledge-intensive functions. We further propose that firms breadth and depth of geographical experience (i.e. international and host country experience) are important firm-level contingencies. Results indicate that the depth dimension of geographical knowledge affects the influence of timing on cost savings, but not the breadth dimension. Thus, our study highlights that the multilevel dynamics between activity and firm-level factors influence the cost savings of offshored activities.",offshoring| timing| cost saving

Yet, there are differences in the ways in which offshore contracts are managed, leading to differences in outcomes for different clients and vendors. Motivated by the business need for appreciating the effectiveness of offshore contract administration, the current study proposes and tests a framework for understanding contract administration. Specifically, by distinguishing between contract specification and contract governance, the paper integrates transactional and relational perspectives for a holistic understanding of offshore contract performance. We posit that a well specified (tight) contract coupled with appropriate contract governance mechanisms (mechanistic and/or relational) influences multiple performance outcomes. Further, we theorize the interaction of contract specification with contract governance, such that mechanistic governance complements while relational governance substitutes the effect of contractual tightness on operational performance variables. The theorized model and interaction effects are empirically tested via a field study comprising of Indian offshore software development vendors.

Their increasing participation in cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&As) has raised great attention in the extant literature.

Cross-border M&As conducted by these countries companies indeed lead to significant shareholder wealth creation. Furthermore, Indian shareholders are more likely to benefit from deals in English-speaking countries, while Chinese investors gain favorable returns from the cross-border expansion of manufacturing companies. Location also affects the performance of cross-border M&As, with acquisitions into developed countries generating higher returns to shareholders.

This research therefore focuses on spillovers from foreign direct investment (FDI) in the context where there are rapid and discontinuous changes in technology and market competition, or namely, in high-velocity environments. When environment velocity is high, firms adjust their strategies and those decisions affect the way conventional channels of FDI spillovers work. Our key findings about FDI spillovers in high environment velocity are threefold: 1) local firms are likely to experience significant positive horizontal FDI spillovers, if they compete with MNE subsidiaries; 2) there are insignificant backward FDI spillovers, if local firms are suppliers of MNE subsidiaries; and 3) there are significant positive forward FDI spillovers on local customers, if those local firms buy inputs from MNE subsidiaries. The contribution of this research lies in exploring environment velocity as a moderator in the FDI spillover mechanism and in proposing valid methodology for empirical evidence.

Drawing on this perspective, I seek to disentangle two competing explanations on shareholder involvement in CEO pay by using the French case where excessive CEO pay is a more serious problem in the study period (between 2001 and 2007) thereby enabling me to predict the preference of institutional investors. I also assume monitoring role played by institutional investors varies according to their types. The empirical findings support my hypotheses. First, there is a negative association between the presence of hedge funds and total CEO pay, whereas this relation is not replicated for foreign institutional investors as a whole, suggesting weak monitoring role played by institutional investors other than hedge funds.

This leads to an immediate decline in performance of the remaining network. If divestments, however, cause efficiency gains due to more favorable labor cost conditions and a higher potential to exploit cost differentials across the remaining locations, the negative performance effects are less pronounced.

For the empirical study, we construct a unique panel of firm-level micro data representing 24 different ownership home-countries operating in India as the host-country for the period 2001-2010. We employ a recently developed methodology to estimate extent of earnings redistribution by isolating the focal firms sensitivity to exogenous industry level earnings shock. Using this method we obtain an estimate of elasticity of earnings redistribution that is comparable with prior research findings using alternate methods. We find that institutions of property rights and contracting in the home and host-country positively influences earnings outflow.

Our findings highlight a fundamental rigidity of Hindustan Unilever. By using institutional theory as our interpretative lens, we ascribe this rigidity to the overlap of institutional domains faced by the MNCs subunit, at two levels: 1. the constant search for legitimacy in both the host country domain and within the MNC, which requires the concurrent adherence to local policies and to practices institutionalized within the MNC; 2. the simultaneous pursuit of legitimacy in both low- and high-income markets, which requires non-consistent actions to conform to cognitively distant social groups.  Building on previous work, we label these dynamics as institutional dualism. This work advances the current understanding of strategic behavior in BoP markets.

Five industries were selected from the top-ten environment polluting industries in Bangladesh; these are the tannery, pulp & paper, fertilizer, textile and cement industries.  From each industry group, two sample plants were selected  with five executives participating from each plant. This study highlights the reality of Bangladeshi industrial plants in applying pollution prevention initiatives. It reveals that compared to leading firms in developed countries, pollution prevention initiatives in Bangladesh are underutilized.

However, most research examines a short time scale and has not fully theorized the time effects. Firms must develop appropriate processes to yield good social and environmental performances that in turn allow for a strong financial performance. These processes are idiosyncratic, timeframe-dependent and necessarily take time. We argue that firms that properly manage environmental and social challenges are more resilient than those that do not. Resilience is a capability that develops over time as a result of continually handling risks, stresses and strains, which allow firms to use resources successfully to resolve issues. Resilience translates to stable growth and performance that is only evaluable in the long term. To perform this analysis, we use a sample of 153 matched pairs of US firms in terms of size and sector. We analyze growth and performance variability paths over fifteen years. The results show that responsible firms have a higher long-term growth path than irresponsible firms and that differences increase over time. In addition, performance variability is always smaller for responsible firms than for irresponsible firms. In summary, responsible firms demonstrate better adaptability to their environments and are more resilient.",long-term| resilience| sustainability

Specifically, I explore how individuals economic, social, and environmental values relate to their propensity to engage in strength or concern actions across the three sustainability domains.  Individuals with strong economic values had a significantly greater propensity to engage in all types of concern actions including economically harmful actions.  Strong economic values were also shown to decrease the propensity for social and environmental strength actions, and to increase the willingness to work in controversial industries.  An unanticipated but significant finding concerns gender effects on both values and corporate actions propensity.  Females were found to have significantly stronger social and environmental values and significantly weaker economic values as compared to males.  Males in turn were found to have a significantly greater propensity for concern actions, and were less likely to support social and environmental strength actions.",sustainability| values| corporate actions

In this paper, we investigate the direct relationship between environmental standards and labor productivity, as well as two mediating mechanisms through which environmental standards influence labor productivity: employee training and enhanced interpersonal contacts within the firm.

Firms with environmentally onservative values recognise environmental pressures but its approach is pragmatic and market driven rather than ethical. Thus, environmental activists tend to distrust their commitment to greener corporate activities and associate this type of firms with green-washing and relatively poor environmental performance. However, our empirical results show that firms with conservative values tend to have better environmental performance than other firms. Our model analyses managers conservative values towards the environment, socio-cognitive frames, environmental intentions and the context in which these intentions are formed and translated into sustainable corporate behaviours. We generate a series of hypotheses and use structural equation modelling to test them in the context of a unique data-set from Argentina. The analyses suggest that about 56% of the variations in reported environmental behaviour can be explained by the model and sheds light on  the relative importance of mindset versus context considerations in the determination of environmental intentions and sustainable corporate behaviours.",environmental policy| structural equation modelling| discourse

Eco-labels are often developed by third-parties separate to the industries that produce and sell the eco-product to create credibility. The goal of these agencies is to reduce the information asymmetry between producers and consumers over the environmental attributes of a good. However, by focusing on this information asymmetry, rather than how the label meets consumer needs, agencies may develop eco-labels that send an irrelevant, confusing or detrimental message to consumers. In a discrete choice experiment we examine two similar eco-labels for wine, one associated with a quality reduction and the other not. The majority of respondents in our study were unaware of the difference between the labels. We found that respondents preferred eco-labeled wines over an otherwise identical counterpart, when the price was low and the wine was from a low quality region. However these preferences were reversed if the wine was expensive and from a high quality region. These results indicate that respondents obtain some warm glow value from eco-labeled wine, but also interpret it as a signal of low quality. This provides a clear lesson for policy makers that focusing purely on information asymmetries will not necessarily create eco-labels that align eco-products with the needs of consumers.",eco-label| environmental standards| differentiation strategy

In a sample of 127 greenhouse growers in Spain, we examine their readiness to participate in a market-based approach to buying and selling water.  We found that a combination of characteristic, attitude, and demographic variables impacted the probability that a grower would be ready to participate in formal water markets.  The level of education of the grower, and the use of a euro/hour metering system positively impacted the probability of participation.

The payoff to disclosure is uncertain. Some investors and consumers are likely to respond positively, while others may not depending on the content of the disclosures. Under conditions of uncertainty, information-based models of herding predict that firms are more likely to look to the behaviour of others. Using data from the Carbon Disclosure Project between 2003 and 2010, we estimate the probability of disclosure. We test a series of hypotheses to examine whether firms are influenced by the disclosure of other similar firms. We find initial evidence of imitative behaviour within groups of similar firms. Our research extends the limited empirical literature on imitation to an important area of environmental strategy.  We also contribute to integrating economic and sociological perspectives on imitation.

The history of the search engines development, however, raises an interesting puzzle: Though librarians claim information search and retrieval as their primary professional function, none of the 74 search engines developed between 1989 and 2010 was developed by a librarian. In this paper, we explore the role of institutional logics in shaping field-level innovation activities. We demonstrate how, in the case of librarians, a dominant logic centered on retrieving the one best answer scraped against early search technologies that democratized the web and offered quantity over quality. Drawing upon an in-depth content and discourse analysis of 22 years of articles from key professional librarian journals, we build a process model of the changing relationship between search technology and librarians dominant search logic. We, therefore, demonstrate how the librarian field as a whole engaged with internet search technologies in ways that shifted from dismissive to distinctive to dialogical to directed, ultimately making important contributions to this technology but in ways that shifted over time, both shaping and shaped by librarians perspectives on search more generally. Our findings provide an important example of how institutional logics shape innovation activities at the field level and, contrasting with studies of institutional change and institutional entrepreneurship, how dominant institutions can act to restrain and shape, not just enable, technological change.",institutional logic| innovation| internet

Previous research suggests that for technical reasons, knowledge development enables change.

We find support for these ideas in a longitudinal study of the relationship between knowledge development and technical change in the microcomputer market of the U.S. computer industry. We position microcomputer organizations in knowledge space based on their patenting behavior, and predict that knowledge space location, consensus, and consistency will affect an organizations likelihood to adopt a CPU from a new supplier. We find that organizations that both research in an area of knowledge space associated with a CPU and that are consistent in their knowledge development are more likely to adopt a target CPU. Organizations that research in non-consensus areas are less likely to adopt any CPU. Surprisingly, knowledge space location alone does not have a significant effect on CPU adoption. This suggests that knowledge development can enable change within organizations, but not simply because of the technologies developed. Knowledge also creates a context that generates social consensus to support change.

In spite of empirical support, it is not clear that this dichotomy of economic (early) versus institutional (later) actors constitutes a comprehensive theory of the motivations driving firm adoption behavior. An alternative, old conceptualization of institutions presents some organizations as embodying values above and beyond their technical functions. This earlier perspective presents organizations as more agentic, but is vague in its explanation of which firms become institutions and how value is added. This paper helps address these issues and bridge the new and old perspectives by considering the question: To what extent do later adopting firms act for economic reasons? By drawing on the mechanisms of inferential learning and customization, I propose a model at the intersection of the institutional and learning literatures that identifies four potential strategies for late-stage adopters. By interpreting the actions of others and customizing according to their needs, firms can identify economic opportunity, while infusing their actions with greater meaning. As such, this theory helps delineate more effectively the complex motivations that drive firm adoption behavior at all stages of diffusion.",adoption| learning| customization

We argued the mixed results come from the ignorance of the fact that different categories of organizations may react to MNCs using different strategic choices. To reconcile the conflicts and give a proper evaluation of MNCs' spillover effect in establishing new practice, we draw on the concept of organization identity to differentiate two identity groups among Chinese auditing firms. We then examine how the foreign auditing firms' horizontal spillovers on establishing new audit practice are contingent on domestic auditing firms' group identity. We find that the presence of foreign auditing firms in China has positive horizontal spillovers on upgrading-status domestic auditors' audit quality, while negative horizontal spillovers on low-status domestic auditors' audit quality. The findings contribute to literature on spillover effect and institutional theory in two ways. First, we show that prior studies overestimate the spillover effect of foreign firms on domestic firms due to lack of subpopulation-based approach. Second, we note the identity as a valid contingent factor in reconciling the inconsistency in institutional spillover effect on domestic firms.",spillover effect| organization identity| audit quality

While trending in adoption patterns was observed there was no evidence about abandonment but cohabitation. It is argued that taken for grantedness of  external sources of legitimation leads to ritual adoption patterns and pseudo-institutionalization, the latter defined as collaboratively constituted, but narrowly diffused and partly entrenched reciprocal activity patterns, which are subject to cyclical transformation by external triggering events.

Further, it expands prior conceptions of abandonment by distinguishing between the initial decommitment and final abandonment.  Using random effect logistic regressions, we find that while diversification was adopted to improve performance, the rationale for abandonment evolves over time.

I suggest that reasons for this are the complexity of the signals emanating from rankings, the conflict of legitimacy and technical pressures as well as the competition of rhetorical devices in the ranking field. The analysis of an exploratory qualitative data set from the German higher education field yields four boundary conditions under which rankings are likely to have no impact on, increase or diminish isomorphic pressures in organisational fields: The competition of rhetorical devices, the informational complexity and resource conflicts in the ranking field as well as the embeddedness of rankings in the ranking field. By refining Wedlins concept of rhetorical devices (2010), this paper advances a more complex definition of rankings and contributes to the literature on the conditions of isomorphic field change and the role of rhetorical devices therein.",isomorphism| rankings| change in organisational fields

Second, as the extant way of considering institutional constraint does not take into consideration recent development on institutional work, we re-conceptualize institutional constraint to mean the difference between what is intended and what is achieved.

This article identifies patterns of legitimacy making that are associated with organizational vitality, which is quantitatively measured by levels of religious fund assets per devout adherent.

We address this gap by exploring the factors that influence the level of social performance in socioeconomic hybrids. We argue that investment in the social mission is positively associated with higher social performance in these organizations.

We regard SRI as a hybrid product category that is expected to meet two competing institutional demands: the demand for high financial returns, on the one hand, and the call for social and environmental responsibility, on the other. We draw upon the sociology of worth by Boltanski and Thevenot to investigate how these demands are mobilized by proponents of the market world and the civic world, respectively. Our particular focus is on the role of the product category as a passage point for institutional demands, i.e. as the medium through which compromise can be both established and contested. Using data from participative observation, semi-structured interviews and documents, we show how concerns with the ambiguity of SRI led to increased contestation of the product category and eventually to regulatory initiatives in the form of SRI codes and labels. By taking a process rather than a content view on SRI, these initiatives led to a compromise which is both powerful and fragile: powerful, because the ambiguous character of SRI product allows many investments to qualify as socially responsible and, thus, the idea of SRI to spread widely; fragile, because it also elicits criticism among those who are concerned with the actual content of the investments and who suggest that the compromise between the market and the civic world is of symbolic nature only.

The theoretical literature suggests that for a stigma to emerge over a category of organizations, a critical mass of actors sharing the same beliefs should be reached. Scholars have yet to empirically examine the techniques used to diffuse this negative judgment. This study is aimed at bridging this gap by investigating Goffmans notion of stigma-theory: how do stigmatizing actors rationalize and emotionalize their beliefs to convince their audience? We answer this question by studying the stigma over the finance industry since 2007. After the subprime crisis, a succession of events put the industry under greater scrutiny, and the behaviors and values observed within this field began to be publicly questioned. As an empirical strategy, we collected opinion articles and editorials that specifically targeted the finance industry. Building on rhetorical analysis and other mixed methods of media content analysis, we explain how the stigmatizing rhetoric targets the origins of deviant organizational behaviors in the finance industry, that is, field-level institutional logics. We bridge the gap between rhetorical strategies applied to discredit organizations and ones used to delegitimize institutional logics by drawing a parallel between these two literatures. Taking an abductive approach, we argue that institutional contradiction between field and societal-level logics is sufficient but not necessary to generate organizational stigma.",organizational stigma| institutional logics| rhetoric

Instead of either logic replacing the other, the proportion of influence shifted, resulting in the Main Street logic adopting more of the practices associated with the Wall Street logic. This change in the institutions operation did not shift its higher logic at a more constitutive level of analysis: at a broader (societal) institutional level, government backing in support of home mortgages underwent much less change. The combination of a continuing commitment to a societal norm (home ownership), with the relaxation of the operational rules and standards understood to administer it, encouraged a liminal state and identity changes. During this period, absent clear signals for how (or how not) to implement the continuing policy, rules consistent with the institutionalized Main Street logic were converted back to the more risk-oriented Wall Street logic which had preceded it, encouraging the relaxation of criteria for loan eligibility to receive mortgages and their sale in the form of riskier, mortgage-backed financial instruments. Implications for theorizing about the source of change and the negotiation of practice within institutions are addressed.",endogenous logics| institutional theory| financial crisis

There is, however, no consensus on the question whether institutional logics shape individuals actions in the first place, and they thus rather passively enact them, or whether actors are able to strategically react to institutional logics. In this paper we aim at reconciling those two positions by exploring on the micro-level how individuals can draw on multiple institutional logics. We use a sociology of knowledge perspective to elaborate our theoretical argument and to interpret an interview with a CEO, who switches between two different logics when asked to justify performance deficits of the HR department. Drawing on this illustrative empirical case, we show how the requirement to be perceived as consistent, rational and reliable, which is inherent in the notion of modern actors, restricts actors freedom in enacting different logics in a pluralist institutional environment. We therefore contribute to current calls stressing the importance of studying how the macro-level influences individuals attitudes and practices and as well as to the reflection of the relationship between institutions and actors in general.",institutional logics| sociology of knowledge| micro-perspective

Empirical data is obtained qualitatively through interviews with 24 producers, 14 directors and 14 first assistant directors. As a result of being in the middle position between producer and director, the first assistant director experiences role conflict and role ambiguity. However, precisely because of this position the first assistant director is able to perform a mediating role, helping to bridge the faultline between art and commerce.",role theory| film| faultlines

The dynamics of organizational responses to complexity,1|Laerke Hojgaard Christiansen|Copenhagen Business School||,,"How do organizations experience and respond to institutional complexity? Organizations are often confronted with multiple demands imposed by their environment and whilst they face the same pressures, their responses differ. This case study explores how organizational actors within a global brewery group headquarter and a local subunit experience and respond to the same institutional complexity in two distinct ways, one through compartmentalization, the other through institutional bricolage. The paper contributes to the literature on institutional logics by exploring how and why different logics are prioritized. It shows that organizational responses may depend on the dominant modes of logic interaction in the institutional field, attempts at praxis and assumed synergy creation. Furthermore in the process of bricolage, organizational identity is proposed to be an important driver to further collaboration between actors embedded within different institutional logics.",institutional bricolage| institutional logics| institutional complexity

We show that institutional entrepreneurs who work from within an organization, with a deeply rooted identity, and a highly normative institutional environment are caught between a rock and a hard place. They have to cope with organizational and field level inertia. Based on a longitudinal case study, we draw a process model of bridging institutional entrepreneurship in which institutional entrepreneurs use discursive techniques to gain social validation of their innovation. As they face reistance from outside and inside the organization, they complement discursive strategies with defense and coping mechanisms. When institutional entrepreneurs are forced to acknowledged failure, a high level of discursive activity is required, again, to enable the organization to recover and reconnect with dominant norms. In recovering from failed institutional entrepreneurship, institutional entrepreneurs  need to induce internal and external audiences to perceive an inevitable change of direction as a normal and logical step in the implementation of a new strategic intent.",bridging institutional entrepreneurship| institutional logics| french grandes ecoles

Focusing in particular on the controversial H-1B visa program, it analyzes how immigration law firms help maintain the politicized field of high-skilled labor migration.  I argue that immigration law firms operate as hinges  actors that enable disparate groups within a field to concurrently pursue their strategic objectives.  As hinges, immigration law firms engage in different forms of clutch work, which links and disengages rival parties while acting as a buffer between them.  By shielding regulatory agencies and employers from direct interaction with each other, immigration law firms reduce friction, limit visibility, and create spaces in which both groups can advance their interests.  My findings show that insulating gaps in the social structure of contested fields helps maintain their continuity while allowing for controlled adaptation.

Using an inductive and iterative qualitative approach, we empirically test and confirm previous propositions that logics do not affect organizations equally; rather, they are filtered by the latter's endogenous characteristics relating to its field position, structure, ownership and governance, and identity. In addition to these, we find that factors exogenous to the organization namely its access to information and availability of measurement tools relating to the new logic act as filters as well. How organizations experience complexity then shapes the meanings which they attach to their roles and defines their specific standards which lead them to respond heterogeneously in their level of commitment to the new logic, level of ambiguity in practices, and training and learning practices.",institutional logics| institutional complexity| socially responsible investing

Based on a qualitative study of private entrepreneurship in China, we found that entrepreneurs blended the traditionally strong family logic with the emerging market logic to construct a distinctive identity, and that they simultaneously blended the dominant state logic with the emerging profession logic to construct an institutional identity. The two dimensions of identity are intertwined, and the balance between them is crucial for identity construction, and ultimately for legitimacy. This study demonstrates empirically how entrepreneurs are able to blend seemingly contradictory institutional logics to form identities that both conform to and break with existing institutional norms. It contributes to a nuanced understanding of the relationship between institutional logics and identity. It opens up the possibility that institutional logics not only define identity and guide entrepreneurial action, but also are involved in the identity formation process, and hence can be transformed in the process.",institutional logics| identity| institutional complexity

The extant work on organizational response to institutional contradictions has focused on practice configurations but inadequately highlighted the role of both actions and meanings in addressing these demands.

By intersecting the existing categories of differentiation and integration of demands with action and meanings, I propose the possible array of organizational responses. Moreover, for an organizational initiative that juxtaposes social and profit logics, I identify organizational identity, design and governance as the critical points of tension and posit that organizations can navigate the tension between logics by increasing or decreasing the 'distance' between institutional referents at each of these points. In the light of the proposed model I elucidate how this distance can be continually shifted through actions and meanings such that the vicious cycle of the tension can be escaped while its generative potential can be engaged for sustaining the hybridity of logics.",social and profit logics| tension| paradox

Positive performance feedback tends to motivate more sustained exploration of the search space, while at the same time constraining search to the neighborhood of an existing alternative.  An explanation for this apparently contradictory finding is that both decisions are influenced by different aspirations. The decision about whether to search entails aspirations about what is attainable. Positive feedback shifts aspirations upwards, thereby prolonging exploration. In contrast, where to search is governed by a simple aspiration of performance improvement, and positive feedback tends to promote exploitation by narrowing down refinement search to a particular region of the search space.

Seen from this perspective, firms achieve sustainability by dissociation. Using an unbalanced panel of diversified firms from 1992 to 2010, I test whether negative sustainability ratings are related to divestitures, and whether the strength of this relationship is moderated by the extent to which firms are targeted by shareholder activists, and whether or not firms engage in sustainability reporting.

The second interdependent movement involves how experts develop their personal involvement in producing analysis and interpretation in important organizational decision-making forums.

Drawing from survey responses of 1077 professional engineers and geoscientists, we reconstruct their framings of the issue and knowledge claims to position themselves within their organizational and their professional institutions.  In understanding the struggle over what constitutes and legitimizes expertise, we make apparent the heterogeneity of claims and legitimation strategies within one profession. By linking notions of the science or science fiction of climate change to the assessment of the adequacy of global and local policies and of potential organizational responses, we contribute to the understanding of defensive institutional work by professionals within fossil fuels-companies and their professional associations.",framing| expertise| defensive institutional work

Through our qualitative historical account of the evolution of self-regulation in the US Forest and Paper industry, we explain how seemingly antagonistic self-regulatory organizations develop interdependently. Over time, two separate self-regulatory organizations became less entrenched in its initial ideological position over time, and the two converged on a number of issues and adopted a number of common structures and practices. We identify a set of mechanisms that promote and halt convergence between the self-regulatory organizations and identify theoretical implications for the study of institutional pluralism at the industry-level.",institutional theory| pluralism| self-regulation

Yet, its meaning is often vague and varies across contexts, relating to both a methodological approach and an empirical process. This paper focuses on the latter, developing an explicit theory of the sensemaking process as reasoning  the relating of beliefs, actions and observations as reasons for one other. The reasoning-based theory provides an analytical definition of meanings as the valid inferences across beliefs, making explicit for the first time the precedents and outcomes of sensemaking episodes. Sensemaking is thus a recursive process of reconfiguring the private and shared commitments to the validity of beliefs and their meanings based on other accepted beliefs and their meanings. Reasoning is both cognitive (revising the validity of beliefs and inferences across beliefs) and social (offering claims as reasons for one other).",sensemaking| meaning| reasoning

Drawing from a negotiated orders perspective of institutionalization and novel data from the development of ISO 26000, an international standard defining the practice of CSR, this paper argues that whether a constituent is persuaded will depend upon the bargaining skills of an organization. An organizational negotiation skills model of institutional persuasion is developed and tested with results suggesting that an organizations likelihood of persuasion is strongly influenced by its ability to occupy leadership positions, be resilient in framing ideologically salient issues, and use framing language that theorizes the meaning of the practice within negotiation contexts. Unlike prior work on negotiations in which the ideological nature of issues served as a barrier to an organizations ability to persuade our results suggest that those organizations that actively addressed and theorized around salient, ideological issues were highly persuasive.",contested practices| institutional change| negotiation

The comparative setting allows us to make several contributions to the inconclusive discussion about agency in professional fields. In particular, contrary to the extant literature, we show that in highly professional contexts novel fields may arise from non-divergent agency. Our study further shows that in the case of divergent, problem-driven change, high status actors are reluctant to engage in activities that may threaten their position or legitimacy within the mainstream of their profession. Finally, we uncover that boundary work in the case of non-divergent, opportunity-driven change may originate from demarcating the fashions and isms from the core tasks of the profession, which differs from the kinds of boundary work that have been previously addressed by the literature, where the core beliefs and practices of the profession are under threat.",profession| institutional| emergence

These interstitial issues can catalyze different types of new interactions across fields -in the form of collaborative, contested, or mediated relationships- which in turn facilitate the development of proto-institutions.

Synthesizing these two domains yields a conceptualization of positive institutional work that differs markedly from current portraits of institutional work in the literature in three ways. 1) It develops a mode of institutional legitimacy  based not only on the symbolic meanings associated with various social patterns but also on the ways that those patterns are actually, subjectively experienced. 2) It offers an alternative to the dominant view of institutional entrepreneurship as political and discursive contest between competing interests, suggesting instead that institutional agency can also be applied in an intentionally exploratory, dialogical way that does not presuppose that new institutional patterns are apparent in advance to the entrepreneur. 3) It challenges the assumption that institutional creation and maintenance necessarily consist of boundary work. Creation and maintenance of positive institutional patterns may instead be dependent upon fostering boundary plasticity, something usually associated mainly with institutional disruption. This alternative portrait of institutional work suggests a number of avenues of future research as well as offering potentially fruitful areas of practice for institutional change agents interested in the kinds of positive phenomena studied by POS scholars.",positive organizational scholarship| institutional theory| institutional work

This study analyzes the determinants of a compensation practice called the Peak Wage System (PWS) in Korea using panel data from 2005 to 2009 for 950 workplaces. The empirical findings show that political identity (union affiliation) explains adoption of a new practice above and beyond variance explained by other institutional factors including coercive factor (public sector affiliation) and normative factors (the activities of HR professionals). The result demonstrates that political identity-based isomorphism occurs as a mechanism that a new practice overcomes a resistance of organization to the adoption and evolves into more legitimate one.",diffusion| political identity| interorganizational relations

The CCO view allows for examining partial organizations as dynamic phenomena that typically undergo a discursive trajectory over time. Based on the empirical example of the Equator Principles (EP) standard in international project finance, we show that global partial organizations can face pressures of eventually developing into a more complete organization, that is, by adding further organizational elements (e.g., hierarchies, membership, etc.).

The prior literature, however, focuses on the benefits of symbolic management and tends to treat it as costless. If symbolic management is costless, however, then presumably all firms should pursue it, yet in practice they do not.  In this paper, we examine the costs as well as the benefits of symbolic management.  We emphasize selective (but truthful) disclosure as a tool for adjusting the extent of coupling between symbolic and substantive action.  We identify both internal and external costs of selective disclosure.  Internal costs arise because firms must undertake at least some level of substantive action in order to have something to truthfully disclose; external costs arise because some stakeholder groups may be sensitive to incomplete corporate disclosure, and impose costs on firms that partially disclose their performance.  We test our hypotheses using data from the Department of Energys Voluntary Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program for 1995-2003, a context in which there were multiple stakeholders with conflicting demands.  We find that firms in this setting typically engaged in symbolic management by way of selective disclosure of their favorable substantive actions.  This contrasts with the complete decoupling of substantive and symbolic action, i.e. false representation, emphasized in prior work on symbolic management. We also find that firms were more likely to not to disclose at all when they faced strong stakeholders who were highly sensitive to incomplete claims. We contribute to the literature on symbolic management by identifying circumstances under which symbolic management is too costly to pursue because it alienates certain stakeholder groups.",symbolic management| costs| selective disclosure

We study the content of trade publication articles to understand how field actors respond to umbrella constructs and how their responses may influence evolution in the meaning of the constructs over time. Results of our inductive analysis indicate that discourse on the umbrella construct of environmental management did not follow a linear trajectory of expansion, but went through successive periods of surge fueled by public controversy around specific environmental issues. Furthermore, we observe a division of labor between front line actors and collective actors in the framing of environmental management.

In our paper, we analyze the consequences of this contestation among multiple logics, fueled by competing self-organizing collective actors, on the organizational founding rate. We claim that competition among collective actors affects the founding process in two opposing ways. One the one hand, it spurs the founding rate as entry barriers are reduced. On the other hand, the resulting heterogeneous entry tempers the rate as it undermines the population-level legitimacy commons by producing fuzziness. We also predict that differences in the sub-forms perceived template quality will moderate the effects of this contestation on organizational foundings.

Each of these processes is subjected to distinct power struggles manifested in different framing contests when several competing technological frames are crafted, are contradictory and attempt at capturing the same resources. We also show that technology framing contests increase ambiguity which may in turn spark the need to rely on technology testing in order to bring a resolution of the debate, to lower ambiguity and to provide legitimacy to the purpose and benefits of a technology. Furthermore, we show that when framing contests over diffusion cannot be resolved through legitimated means, institution testing may come into play. This is likely to occur when the cultural-cognitive legitimacy of a technology have acquired sufficient force to trump regulatory legitimacy.",framing contest| technology frame| diffusion

We test these arguments using individual data from the 2000 Census that have been merged with two different large community surveys, the 2000 Social Capital Benchmark Survey and the General Social Survey. We find that individuals in communities with high average levels of social trust are more likely to be self-employed than individuals in communities with lower levels of social trust.  Additionally, while high levels of membership in organizations that are connected to the larger community are associated with higher levels of self-employment, high levels of membership in isolated organizations are associated with lower levels of self-employment.

First, early in any industrys  history, entrepreneurs are socially prominent individuals or those from related industries, while later entrepreneurs are from an increasingly broad range of social statuses. Second, pioneering entrepreneurs come from the social periphery while later entrepreneurs include more industry insiders and members of the social elite. To test these hypotheses, we study the magazine industry in America over the first 120 years of its history, from 1741 to 1860. We find that magazine publishing was originally restricted to industry insiders, elite professionals, and the highly educated, but by the time the industry was well-established, most founders came from outside publishing and more were of middling stature  mostly small-town doctors and clergy without college degrees. We also find that magazines founded by industry insiders remained concentrated in the three biggest cities, while magazines founded by outsiders became geographically dispersed.

Important breakthroughs often come from attempts to blend elements from disparate knowledge domains, and legitimating and promoting new ideas requires skill to bridge multiple worlds that may potentially benefit from the innovations. Each process, however, can also generate unintended consequences at both individual and collective levels. When blending and bridging are not balanced, the efforts of field entrepreneurs are likely to be subject to negative consequences such as unclear identity, increased coordination and evaluation costs, illegitimacy discount, and the so-called over-mobilization crises.

While a high density at founding decreases the survival chances of an organization, this effect is less harmful when experiences with the form are small. The study integrates these ideas, from the recent literature on organizational ecology, and helps to extend the previous findings regarding competition and density effects in terms of organizational and management theory.",organizational ecology| population experiences| organizational ancestors

A meta-analysis of institutional influences on ecological processes,1|Michel Lander|HEC Paris||2|Pursey Heugens|RSM Erasmus U.||,,"Organizational ecology and organizational institutionalism are currently amongst the most prominent theories in the organizational theory field. Both perspectives emerged from very similar scholarly origins, employ similar empirical methods, and address closely related theoretical questions. Because of the sometimes tense relationships between the scholarly communities developing and testing these twin perspectives, however, important opportunities for theoretical integration are foregone too often. In this paper we argue that integrating both perspectives is not only a possibility but a necessity, as ecological processes effectuating organizational foundings and failures, as well as industry entry and exit, are critically shaped by institutional influences. We use standard meta-analytical techniques to synthesize available organizational ecology studies, and meta-analytic regression methods to model variance in terms of the strength of institutional forces within and across organizational fields. Within organizational fields, we find that coercive, mimetic, and normative forces can both mitigate and exacerbate ecological processes. Across organizational fields, we find that fields that are home to so-called institutionalized organizations are less susceptible to ecological forces than fields in which organizations are primarily exposed to market (as opposed to institutional) forces. Our study thus shows that ecological and institutional theories of organization are strongly complementary perspectives, that can best be used in combination for explaining organizational vital events.",institutional theory| organizational ecology| meta-analysis

How does the balance among logics evolve within a field and what kind of trajectories may a set of logics experience over a long term period remain unclear. Especially, extant literature tends too often to downplay institutional complexity by focusing on two dominant logics and ignore modes of interaction among logics others than competition. In order to address these issues, we apply to the field of workplace safety in the construction industry a rather new methodology for measuring institutional logics. We indeed make use of a descendant hierarchical classification model for analyzing articles published in a leading French trade journal over more than a century. Our preliminary results, which are based on a pilot study of 649 articles, identify six institutional logics at work within the field, thus underlining the need for neo-institutionalist research to direct its attention toward pools of logics rather than two of them. Additionally, they tend to provide support to the notion of sedimentation, which suggests that institutional logics may succeed one another in gradual waves, i.e. that newly dominant logics cohabite with weakened but persistent older logics.",descendant hierarchical classification model| institutional complexity| pool of institutional logics

This paper argues that the assumptions of these different perspectives might be sensitive to the context and hence need to be reexamined. Specifically, it presents a theory of punctuated age dependence, which suggests that the changes in the institutional environment resets the legitimacy clocks of organizations, leaving older organizations prone to selection pressure and newer organizations better off. However, as organizations in the population gain institution specific experience, the advantages of newer organizations born within the new institutional environment tend to diminish. An empirical examination of three institutional transformations in the Indian banking industry lends support for this theory.",organizational expansion| age dependence| institutional transformation

These theories overlook how firms in some countries could draw on the history of cooperatives to compensate for these deficiencies without pursuing vertical integration. This article illustrates this possible strategy by examining how a farm management company and a public/private organization in the wine industry in Argentina draw on recessive institutions associated with cooperatives to address this problem.

The argument is developed in the context of German industrial relations, where an increasing number of small- and medium-sized enterprises have been able to operate without unions and works councils.  It is argued that such defections from the traditional industrial relations system will be sustainable only as long as they remain in the shadow of traditional industrial relations, that is, as long as the traditional system of institutions is being upheld (in particular) by the large corporations.  Two institutional development paths are outlined from a scenario of a further expanding shadow sector:  Firstly, it is predicted that German unions would have to devolve power to the grassroots and that industrial relations would then become more adversarial.  Secondly, as a response to the first development, a swing back to the traditional industrial relations system is predicted, stabilizing an institutional configuration that is deemed consistent and sustainable by the VoC literature.",industrial relations| varieties of capitalism| institutional change

Employing a longitudinal cross-level research design, we trace the evolution of French Grandes Ecoles of Commerce (FGEC) from the early 1800s to the present. Our findings reveal that changes in the broader institutional environment trigger critical junctures, whereby organizations are confronted with a heightened level of institutional complexity. Organizational responses to complexity during these critical junctures not only act to recursively change an incumbent logic, but also influence the future trajectory of intra-logic evolution. We develop an analytical framework outlining six ideal-type mechanisms and processes that characterize intra-logic persistence and change. These ideal types can be organized along three broad dimensions: instrumental, structural, and cultural-inertial. This study empirical demonstrates that intra-logic change is bound by past decisions, path-dependent processes, and a supporting institutional infrastructure that is reproduced and perpetuated by self-reinforcing mechanisms.",institutional complexity| intra-logic change| path dependence

Despite ample empirical and theoretical knowledge concerning such courses of events, managers and policy-makers still remain puzzled when facing decline in turnover, firm numbers, employment, and technological activity. We ask why managers and policy-makers fail to increase their performance in combating industrial decline. We argue that an important part of the answer lies in narrative divergence, i.e. differences in the structure and content, in the stories told within and about the industry. Such divergence contributes to the inability of the industrial community to collectively identify, comprehend and construct the idea of radical change and a suitable course of action to achieve it. Our empirical material concerns the decline of the Finnish forest cluster and consists of 84 articles and 30 semi-structured interviews with industry executives. Through classification into three poetic modes (comic, tragic, and epic) and eight sources of inertia, we find that tragic and epic narratives dominate whereas the comic narrative remains in the margin, and that the sources of inertia are comprehended very differently in these poetic modes. The divergence of the dominant narratives leads into a strong polarization between them, which makes it increasingly difficult to agree on the problem to be tackled and to find a solution acceptable to all. We encourage managers to be sensitive to storytelling practices because they play an important role in constructing reality within and between organizations.",community ecology| narrative| industrial decline

We then investigate how spread of the new market logic is influenced by field structure and on the other hand, how the multiplicity of logics affects field structure. Longitudinal quantitative analyses of our original archival datasets along with qualitative quotes from different sources suggest that level of democracy, openness towards global economy, importance in the national economy as well as higher centrality and structural equivalence are the predictors of adoption of a market logic.

Our evidence further suggests that these local conditions functioned sometimes as a filter to macro institutional logics and other times as a lever to actors institutional work.

Both efficiency and legitimacy concerns motivate early- and late-adopting firms although the former are driven by the prospect of economic and social gains, while the latter, by economic and social losses. In this paper, we analyze the process by which a globally legitimated model diffuses and becomes institutionalized in a national setting. Utilizing a longitudinal dataset on a sample of 300 largest Korean corporations, we examine how the factors that are associated with the adoption of ISO 9000 have shifted between 1992 and 2006. As expected, both economic and functional motivations co-existed with social, legitimacy concerns in the earlier period. Exporting and manufacturing firms were more likely to be certified because of enhanced marketing opportunities in advanced markets and operational efficiency gains expected from adopting ISO 9000. At the same time, chaebol firms, conscious of being at the cutting edge of innovative management practices, were quick to adopt ISO 9000; and large firms imitated other large firms behavior. However, in the changed environment after the Asian financial crisis in 1997, social gains and institutional influences ceased to be the main motivations for adopting ISO standards and certification.

A growing body of literature seeks to understand the factors that impact individual outcomes following revelations of misconduct. One such factor is director departure from the misconduct firm, an ambiguous signal that can be seen as either pro-active distancing on the part of the director or scapegoating on the part of the firm. I argue that the market interpretation of departure from the misconduct firm is moderated by the status of both the individual director and the fraud firm. Using a sample of U.S. corporations that restated earnings between 1997 and 2003, I find that high-status directors fare significantly better on the market for directors than do their lower-status peers when they dissociate from the restating firm. In addition, those departing high-status boards fare worse than others when they dissolve ties before their terms expire. Taken together, my results suggest that high-status firms may pass the stigma of accounting fraud onto their directors, whereas high-status individuals are buffered from stigma by dint of their social position.",misconduct| stigma| status

We show that in the case of the diffusion of contested practices across institutional environments social movement mobilization in the target institutional environment is a necessary condition for practice diffusion. Our study of the shareholder rights movement in Switzerland over the past 30 years shows that the Swiss movement has imported and adapted important aspects of US shareholder-management relations, which allowed it to successfully mobilize and to pressure Swiss companies to adopt specific US corporate governance practices. Diffusion of US corporate governance practices to Switzerland was thus contingent on social movement mobilization and the social movement served as the channel through which practices diffused.",diffusion| social movement| corporate governance

Frame contraction has particular utility for characterizing and understanding:  1) crises and liabilities that threaten movement legitimacy 2) the process by which niche movements seek more mainstream appeal 3) cultural and social changes that force movement adaptation 4) movement factions and schisms. I describe distinct frame contraction processes frame removal, frame minimization, and frame restraintthat characterize common frame contraction strategies in these differing circumstances.

In this paper, we question the implicit assumption in these arguments that consultants are more far-seeing and persuasive than managers. We develop a formal model of innovation adoption and abandonment that centers on the interaction between two populations: consultants that develop and implement novel practices and firms that adopt these practices. We treat both firms and consultants as chasing the secrets of success by mimicking their highest performing peers. Computational experiments assess the interdependent trajectories of client firms and consultants, with a focus on the way consulting efforts to secure and exploit markets might precipitate faddish dynamics among firms. Results show that fads can arise in the absence of behavioral assumptions ascribing superior rationality, insight, or persuasiveness to consultants.

Pondy Best Paper Based on a Dissertation Award||2|William H. Newman Award Nominee||,"Organizational sociologists have developed nuanced accounts to explain when organizations decouple implementation from formal adoption. Prior research sees decoupling as a form of window-dressing, in which organizations take symbolic actions to hide nonconformity. This paper introduces an alternative conceptualization of decoupling that involves actions without words  that is, organizations change their routines while preaching stability to external actors  and develops a theory of how both types of decoupling can occur and the conditions under which each is more likely. When the demand for change is external and the desire for stability is internal, window-dressing is more likely. In contrast, when organizations face conflicting demands regarding change and when the primary source of resistance is external, we would expect closet conformity, wherein organizations preserve symbolic stability while substantially changing their practices. This paper tests the predictions of this theory on the diffusion of the shareholder-value style of corporate governance among Finnish firms between 1990 and 2005. Consistent with this theory, when sanctions for nonconformity are weak and internal resistance to change is strong, firms are more likely engage in window-dressing. In contrast, when powerful external constituents, such as labor unions and foreign investors, impose conflicting demands, firms are more likely to restructure along the shareholder model while maintaining the rhetoric of the older Finnish stakeholder model.",corporate governance| institutional theory| institutional logics

From a phenomenological perspective, I contend that an individuals behavior is culturally constructed in the life course, it is not atomized but structured as a coordinated system within a person, and thus the structure of behavior plays a critical role in facilitating to adopt new ideas.  For an empirical analysis, this study illustrates how each individuals structure of behavior is related to the adoption of VoIP technology (Voice over Internet Protocol).  To identify the structure of behavior in the individual level, I newly measure behavioral connectedness, behavioral fragmentation, and triangular mutuality by using social network frameworks.  The measures consistently indicate how cohesive an individuals behaviors are interconnected with respect to the technology.  Empirical models show that the measures of structure of behavior are significantly related to the probability of accepting the new technology.  It means that the internal fit among institutionalized behaviors is important in facilitating behavioral responses to a new technology.  Those results suggest that an individuals behavior is repeatedly coordinated and re-organized in response to new ideas, and the structure of behavior can be an important micro-level factor to facilitate macro-level changes.",structure of behavior| diffusion| social network framework

Yet, this argument is at odds with evidence showing that structural holes are inherently short-lived  bridges decay faster than embedded ties and brokered individuals tend to connect directly. We suggest that this empirical puzzle is explained by the fact that existing network theory and models focus exclusively on stable (i.e., long-term) network ties, thereby hiding the temporary (i.e., sort-term) social interactions through which such stable ties develop. In this paper, we argue that contrary to received wisdom brokers do not keep their structural holes open in the long run. Rather, they occupy a structural hole for the brief period in which it remains open and then swiftly move across ever new structural holes. We use a relational event model in order to concurrently examine temporary and stable ties and therefore identify the exact time frames in which structural holes are brokered.

Yet most studies have examined knowledge transfer only locally, within a acquainted dyad or an group, or organizationally, between units and firms. Drawing on extensive fieldwork in multiple offices of a large, multinational professional service firm, we identify the pervasive presence of spontaneous knowledge transactions between unacquainted individuals, despite geographical distance, absence of exchange history, or expectations of future interaction. We present the minutiae of such transactions and hypothesize on two boundary conditions for their success: affiliation and status similarity. Highlighting the difference between the observed phenomenon, indirect ties, and complete lack of acquaintanceship, we propose a definition of Performative Ties. We argue that such ties are theoretically significant, have several advantages for knowledge dissemination, and have been observed elsewhere although never explicitly identified. We compare Performative Ties to market, embedded, and community or clan exchange relations to argue that such ties allow wide search of potential exchange partners and intimate transfer once they are found. Thus, Performative Ties combine benefits previously attributed to just one mode of exchange or another. We suggest that Performative Ties allow organizations more efficient use of the knowledge contained in individuals and routines.",knowledge| social network| exchange

Organizations often, intentionally or not, place similar individuals together. Is this something to be troubled about? Our analysis suggests a complex answer. We distinguish between two types of diversity: diversity in ability and diversity in knowledge. Diversity in ability refers to differences in capacity of agents to explore possible solutionsfrom a given starting point, some agents can try x, and others y. Diversity of knowledge means that agents have the same capacity to explore possible solutions, but have different solutions at a given point in time. We find that with respect to ability, local diversity is unambiguously best at all time scales. However, the answer is more complicated for diversity of knowledge. Local homogeneity (segregation) of perspectives is clearly better when conformity pressures are high, because otherwise local heterogeneity quickly leads to systemic homogeneity, destroying the systems capacity to develop new solutions. If systemic pressures toward conformity are reduced, this effect disappears, and even inverts if there is substantial noise in copyingbecause local heterogeneity will then foster exploration in the spaces between solutions.",agent based model| networks| problem solving

Factors that influence responders ability to perform well during a disaster are often speculated upon in the literature but not quantitatively tested.  Consequently, understanding the conditions that structure a more or less effective response are key questions facing the disaster field.  Theory suggests that similarity (homophily principal) or dissimilarity (strength of weak ties, structural holes theory) among responders could have a positive effect on performance outcomes during a disaster.  Other theory suggests that familiarity (structural social capital) among responders prior to the event could have a positive effect on performance outcomes.  We investigated similarity and familiarity as they related to the performance measures of communication frequency and communication effectiveness.  Similarity and familiarity have a stronger effect on communication frequency than communication effectiveness.  Familiarity appears to be more important than similarity for communication effectiveness during a disaster.

Expanding the range of empirical examinations of the impact of relational embeddedness to the individual level, we examine the impact of mobility of professional service providers, specifically lobbyists, on their ability to preserve client relationships upon departure from one firm to another. Our preliminary findings indicate that the strength of relational embeddedness between exchange agent and client improves the chance of preserving client relationships the longer an exchange agents has served a client even after the departure of the exchange agent from one firm to another. Additionally, clients receiving relatively more attention than others in an exchange agent's portfolio of clients will be more likely remain with the exchange manager while that manager remains at the focal firm, but will be less likely to maintain the relationship upon the departure of the exchange manager to another firm. Finally, we identify interesting findings regarding interorganizational exchange relationships managed by teams of professionals. These relationships are more likely to be maintained with the focal firm when any one exchange agent leaves a firm - potentially highlighting the relative strength of firm-level ties that can be developed between organizations when relationships are managed by teams.",embeddedness| executive mobility

To do so, we focus our analysis on one particular type of network management practices  bargaining practices  and ask whether and how they can become path-dependent. Bargaining practices are recurrent activities through which network partners agree to identify and distribute their cooperative surplus. Targeting these practices, we first operationalize the core concepts of path dependence theory by deriving empirical indicators. We then use a pattern matching approach to analyze whether these empirical indicators can be found in real bargaining practices. Empirically, we conduct three case studies of regional networks in the photonics industry. We use qualitative interviews and content analysis to reconstruct the development dynamics of their bargaining practices. A major finding is that network bargaining practices can indeed exhibit inter-organizational path dependencies.

There is no longer a stable core of companies that reliably occupies a center, and the mean geodesic has gone up continuously since 2002.

1536,,3|How Formal and Informal Structures Influence Tie Formation,1|Susan Lynch|INSEAD||,,"This paper considers how changes in formal structure and the embeddedness of an employee's informal relationships influence tie formation. Informal patterns of transitivity will operate to make new relationships more likely between employees who are heavily embedded -- in that they have many contacts in common. At the same time, formal changes that move employees across formal groups are likely to encourage new relationships. Employees placed in the same group have more opportunity to interact and greater incentives to form relationships to efficiently carry out their role and to establish their new organizational identities. When formal changes separate employees into different groups, separated employees have new opportunities to form boundary spanning relationships with members of their old formal group, drawing on their knowledge of that old organization and common experiences created by past formal group membership. I argue that formal and informal structure will act as substitutes as the more valuable boundary spanning relationships will be those that are not heavily embedded with existing contacts as those ties are both more likely to provide non-redundant information and be less accessible via the informal network. I test my arguments using a two-period panel of data on employee relationships in a financial services provider.

We argue that strong ties to influential organization members who are ambivalent about a change (fence-sitters) provide the change agent with an affective basis to coopt them. This cooptation increases the probability that the organization will adopt the change. By contrast, strong ties to influencers who disapprove of a change outright (resistors) are an effective means of affective cooptation only when a change diverges little from institutionalized practices. As the degree of change divergence increases, the advantages of strong ties accruing to the change agent decrease, and may yet turn into liabilities that reduce the likelihood of change adoption. Analyses of longitudinal data from 68 multi-method case studies of organizational change initiatives conducted at the National Health Service in the United Kingdom support these predictions and advance a relational view of organizational change in which social networks operate as tools of political influence through affective mechanisms.",organizatonal change| networks| cooptation

Competing logics expose interstitial brokers to role tensions that hinder the process of resource mobilization for institutional change. I investigate the micro-processes through which interstitial brokers can overcome these role tensions, successfully mobilizing resources for change. As case of institutional change, I examine the selection of Frank Gehry as the new Millenniums global icon of Chicagos public architecture, traditionally oriented towards local Chicago-based architects. I track this iconic change to the actions of a set of interstitial brokers located in the interstice between the competing fields of private business philanthropy and public government. Findings show that in the presence of competing logics interstitial brokers can successfully mobilize resources silently, avoiding direct confrontation and negotiation with defenders of the institutional status-quo, decoupling their vision from action, and co-opting representatives of the status-quo in their mobilization efforts.",institutional change| brokerage| institutional logics

Using the context of firms continuous accounting choices, we specifically address the assumptions of previous research and first assess if the position of the interlocked member (i.e., on board and/or the audit committee) matters for information transfer. Second, we examine if these associations arise after interlock formation and dissolve after interlock dissolution to rule out alternative explanations. Third, we exploit the variance in accounting choices (i.e., high earning quality being better than low earnings quality) to examine if good accounting choices and bad accounting choices diffuse in the same manner and also assess if information transfers are unidirectional or reciprocal.

We propose that, when organizations are exposed to multiple institutional demands by having network ties across institutional boundaries, they are able to engage in institutional arbitrage. We outline various network strategies that firms use to manage the demands of multiple institutions and benefit from differences among them. We also argue that the institutional context in which a focal firm and its partners are located explains the role played by a given structural position in the network, which in turn determines the repertoire of strategic actions a firm will take to manage and benefit from institutional diversity.

Recent research challenges this assumption by recognizing that mechanisms of tie formation operate differently within and across different time frames. For example, in the short term the formation of network ties may be driven by contingent factors related to opportunity or necessity. But not every network tie has the same potential for generating or sustaining long-term relations. We forward this line of inquiry by examining how network mechanisms affect the formation of new ties, and the reproduction of pre-existing ties over different time horizons. We specify relational event models that allow clear identification of the time frames in which these mechanisms operate and to distinguish between processes underlying the creation and the maintenance of network ties between organizations. In an empirical examination of collaborative patient sharing events within a community of hospital organizations, we find that inertia in network ties (or familiarity) operates both in the long and in the short term. Reciprocity, however, only operates in the long term. Finally, we find that embeddedness (or closure) supports the maintenance of network ties only in the long run.

An analysis of the withdrawal behavior of Venture Capital firms from investment syndicates over 25 years yields results consistent with those arguments: the negative effect of prior syndication ties on propensity to stop investing in ongoing syndicates is strengthened by poor market valuation of the industry of the portfolio company, but weakened by a down-round for the portfolio company.

Our findings are threefold. First, we find that existing collaborative or conflictual relationships between two companies perpetuate future relationships of the same type, but crowd out relationships of the different type. This results in (1) an increased likelihood of formation of balanced (uniplex) relationships that combine multiple ties of either collaboration or conflict and (2) a reduced likelihood of formation of unbalanced (multiplex) relationships that combine collaboration and conflict between the same two firms. Second, we find that whereas the networks formation is not driven by a pull toward balanced triads, it is described by a pull away from unbalanced triads. Third and finally, we find that the observed micro-level dynamics of dyads and triads reproduce the structural segregation of the global network into two separate collaborative and conflictual segments of firms.

Event-history analyses and negative binomial regression analyses of the newspaper industry from 1993 to 2007 support my theoretical argument: Middle-status newspapers launched their websites earlier than other newspapers and emphasized the interactive features on the web, the most distinctive characteristic of digital media from the traditional print media.",status| discontinuous technology| digital media

Based on prior work on the knowledge-based view of the firm and the sociology of social evaluation, we develop a model that shows the relationship between status and reputation of a firm based on its knowledge stocks and the impact of these assets on firm performance. We test our hypotheses in a longitudinal research setting with a set of carefully sampled public biopharmaceutical firms. Our results show that the social evaluations of knowledge stocks by both the scientific and business communities affect firm performance. Specifically, we show that the status of a firm and its reputation within the business community based on its knowledge stocks significantly impact on the firms market performance.",status| reputation| knowledge

Kleinbaum|Dartmouth College||,,"While we have ample empirical evidence linking brokerage in intraorganizational social networks to a variety of benefits, we know less about its origins. In this study, I examine the role of individual career history in creating brokerage. I hypothesize that individuals who follow career trajectories that are atypical in the organization will show greater propensity to interact across organizational and social distance than equally mobile individuals whose careers followed more conventional paths.  Furthermore, I argue that bridging ties result from two social-capital based mechanisms  links with former co-workers and with friends of friends  as well as from human capital. Career history is recorded longitudinally for 30,000 employees in a large information technology firm over seven years; network position is measured using a unique data set of over 150 million electronic mail messages. Empirical results support the hypotheses that diverse  and especially atypical  careers have a causal effect on brokerage through mechanisms rooted in social capital. Surprisingly, social capital explains all the variation in bridging; there appears to be no independent human capital effect.",social networks| career mobility| social capital

In particular, what triggers disruption and which jobs within the organizational job structure are most likely to be subject to such disruptive influences? A model is developed that explains the sources for the disruption of organizational job structures and which jobs are most likely to be disrupted. Three dimensions of job structures can be disrupted: the tasks, title, and location. Tasks can be added or removed such that a job is no longer substantively the same. Jobs can be moved horizontally and vertically within organizational hierarchies. Jobs can be altogether eliminated. Which jobs are more likely to be disrupted by these forces is a function of how deeply a job is embedded in the organization, in the unit of the organization, in structures that extend beyond the organization, and in the incumbents holding them.",work| jobs| mobility

Exchanges that were considered but never materialized represent rejections from one party to the other. We claim that these leave an imprint in the relationship, which in turn has consequences for future outcomes. We examine this argument using a proprietary dataset of candidates considered for high-end managerial jobs by an executive search firm over a 5-year period. The results show that who rejected whom in the past matters. Past rejections help actors learn about each other and increase the chances of a future transaction taking place. However, they also trigger rejections on the part of the rejected party, which in turn makes a future relationship less likely to materialize. We discuss the implications of these findings for the literature on dyadic relationship evolution, both in labor markets and in other settings where repeated mutual rejections are possible.",relationship| exchange| market

We find that the study of managerial work has been characterized by a number of recurrent flavours with regards to both the objectives and the approaches adopted in the inquiry. This in turn has generated a sort of methodological ebbs and flows movement that shaped to a considerable extent the nature and focus of the research. The result of  this sort of eternal recurrence is that the field as a whole has fallen into a sort of analytical and empirical rut with the same themes and approaches returning over and over. The ebb and flow pattern also produced a lamentable narrowing of this field so that a number of areas have remained systematically under-researched. After examining some of these areas, in the paper we offer a number of reflections on possible ways forward in the field, suggesting that much is to be gained if contemporary notions of activity and practice are brought into the study of managerial work.",managerial work| literature review| executives

The current study contributes to this literature by developing a nuanced behavioral theoretical framework predicting the differential direct and interaction effects of in-the-money unexercisable and exercisable CEO stock options with firm performance context on the rate of acquisitions. When controlled for endogeneity using fixed-effects two-stage least squares estimation and a panel dataset of 1,098 manufacturing firms from 1993 to 2006, the results showed that consistent with theory unexercisable and exercisable stock options values respectively have positive and negative effects on the rate of acquisitions. In the context of negative deviation from prior performance, the discounting effect of high unexercisable options values that pay off only in the future amplified CEO risk-seeking, resulting in additional acquisitions, while the endowment of high exercisable options values into CEO personal wealth increased risk aversion, leading to lower propensity to acquire. These interaction effects however were not observed in the context of positive deviation from prior performance.",acquisitions| performance| ceo stock options

In particular, based on March's multiple decision-makers argument (1994), we suggest that the different incentives and heterogeneous experiences of the TMT members will affect interpretation of performance feedback and lead to a change in search intensity. Using the data from manufacturing firms in the U.S., from 1992 to 2009, we analyzed our hypotheses. The results show that higher TMT pay dispersion impedes search intensity when performance is below the aspiration levels. In addition, our results suggest that heterogeneous age in the TMT facilitates organizational search as the negative gap between performance and aspiration level increases. We conclude with a discussion on the implications of our findings for research and practice in regard to the effects of TMT pay dispersion and member diversity in performance feedback.",performance feedback| top management team| behavioral theory of the firm

Kim|Columbia U.||2|Bruce Kogut|Columbia Business School||3|Jae-Suk Yang|Columbia U.||,,"The growth in the skewness of the distribution of income in the US dates from the past decades when the remuneration to chief executive officers (CEOs) has increased faster than the growth in firm size. An explanation for this rapid increase is the contagion of changes in social norms which, through a process of social comparison, propagates higher pay among corporate executives. By analyzing this increase in pay as a diffusion process, this paper compares three candidate explanations for contagion: director board interlocks, peer groups, and educational networks. Through coupling a Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) model to endogeneity tests, the results indicate that contagion is evident for all three kinds of networks, but only the peer comparison clearly survives the selection tests. These results support the argument of DiPrete, Eirich, and Pittinsky (2010) that remuneration policies that are anchored on peer group comparisons propagate the diffusion of higher pay among chief executive officers in the US, though only with weak evidence for a leapfrog effect. We show by an agent-based model that the process does not necessarily explode by an unsustainable aspirational bias because of the dampening of the contagion by CEO turnover and tenure effects. A key implication is that internet boom shifted upward the normative expectations of pay through social comparisons.",ceo| networks| inequality

We use seven years of detailed personnel records from a financial services firm to examine the factors that shape this choice. We propose that firms will be more likely to promote workers into jobs that require more firm-specific skills or are more sensitive to individual ability. We also argue that firms may not always directly compare the costs of promotion and hiring; instead, promotion and hiring may often occur as loosely coupled, competing processes that are driven by the supply of promotees on the one hand and unanticipated demands for workers on the other. As a consequence, job characteristics may only affect staffing decisions in the absence of strong pressures either to promote or to hire.

We propose that (1) the tendency to perceive object- rather than activity-oriented partitions in an individuals environment, and (2) the tendency to preserve the social structure of the group an individual belongs to, shape the emergence of a division of labor, in conjunction with technological properties such as the decomposability of a task.  Two lab studies involving the assembly of toy models provide supportive evidence. Specifically, we find that divisions of labor that enable gains from specialization are less likely to emerge naturally and that existing group structure may preclude the emergence of divisions of labor that promise gains from parallelism. We draw implications for self-organized groups as well as the impact of technological change on organizations.",division of labor| experiment

Studies documenting such cynicism have, however, tended to be based within organizations.  Through a detailed ethnography, this paper offers insights into the cynical behaviour of individuals at each stage of the graduate recruitment process into the I.T company, WebCo.  This paper details the process of implementation of an organization that recruits for members who fit the claimed strong organizational culture.  In doing so, the logic of cynicism in relation to the Human Resource Management (HRM) recruitment techniques and strong discourses of organizational culture is discussed.  Through the cynical accounts of employees, it is argued that candidates were able to subvert the managerial colonization of their identity through the compartmentalization of their real and fake selves.  Here, knowledgeable candidates manipulated each stage of the recruitment process by presenting their fake selves and therefore illustrating surface level compliance to the core, managerially desired organizational values.  As a consequence, the ideology of cynicism argument is extended to recruitment processes and it is suggested that the existing organizational power relations were never going to be challenged.  Additionally, this paper directly critiques the notions of technical objectivity that are posited by the prescriptive HRM literature in recruiting for cultural fit by  highlighting the act of recruitment as a social process.",cynicism| recruitment| organizational culture

Traditionally, managing is seen as a value-free scientific endeavor to deliver efficiency and profitability. Scholars have recently pursued the concept of art as an alternative way to describe it (Davis & McIntosh, 2005; Denhardt & Denhardt, 2006; Vaill 1989).  Here still another ontological possibility is explored, that of managing as a craft.  We begin by differentiating craft from art and science  before considering three processes associated with craft in detail:  learning to work with limits; care for end-users, and developing the embodied practices of staying with the senses, engaged detachment and imaginative free play.  We propose that re-conceptualizing managing as a craft discipline offers a means by which practitioners and scholars can be sensitized to the ethical aspects of organizational life and thereby engage with them with a higher degree of awareness and skill.",managing| ethics| craft

In testing the moderating effects of proximity and tenure of the assistant coaches on their subsequent economic values, the results showed no relationship between proximity or tenure on the stigmatization.",stigma| diffusion| top management teams

To fill this gap, we take a processual view of the development of a corporate scandal to examine how the corporate scandal, once an organization-level incident, evolves into a field-level critical event which changes the nature of relationship and interaction among institutional actors. This paper begins by locating the issue of a corporate scandal in a broader discussion on the institutional field. We draw on the Gramscian concept of hegemony which offers a rich theoretical perspective on the power relationship and resilience of institutional field. We then review the literature on social movement theory and show how it highlights a corporation as a target of social movement. Finally, we extend existing studies of framing process and institutional entrepreneurship to develop a process model of the interplay between institutional challengers and defenders in the wake of a corporate scandal.",corporate scandal| institutional work| social movement theory

The empirical tests analyze online restaurant reviews entered voluntarily by consumers in three major US metropolitan areas from October 2004 to October 2011; the data contain information from 1,271,796 reviews written by 252,359 unique reviewers of 18,869 restaurants. The findings show that consumers assign higher ratings to a restaurant when they consider the restaurant and its offerings as authentic, even after controlling for restaurant quality.

Despite the abundance of recent theory and empirical analysis on the topic, far less attention has been paid to policy-oriented fields, such as higher education, where the practical need for social scientific classification has generated intensive efforts to categorize organizational forms.  Drawing on a synthetic review of approaches to classification since the 1960s, we consider how taxonomies of institutions in higher education (such as the widely-used Carnegie Classification) might be informed by organizational theory.  We develop an inductive quantitative approach to classification that aims to meet three criteria of data collection  inclusive sampling of organizations, inclusive sampling of attributes, and attention to external and internal stakeholders  as well as three criteria of analysis  statistical derivation of homogeneous categories, Bayesian updating of categories, and the possibility of partial category membership.  Using IPEDS data on nearly 7,000 universities and colleges, we illustrate how our approach can generate categories of postsecondary institutions that differ from those identified in existing taxonomies.",classification| organizational forms| education

The more intense the attacks on rivals, the more likely audiences will stereotype the industry category and generalize to all members of that industry category the negative attributes implied by the attacks. In this paper, we suggest that the intensity of the public attacks of rivals leads to a greater likelihood that a focal firm will respond to avoid contamination. As the risk of generalization increases, firms tend to dissociate themselves from the tainted industry category by altering their business portfolio. They do so in relation to their own degree of prototypicality (i.e., how much they resemble the average member of the tainted category). We use panel data on the global defense industry between 1996 and 2007 to test our hypotheses. Results support our claims that (1) the public attacks of rivals drive a firms dissociation from the targeted industry and (2) this dissociation is attenuated for less prototypical firms.",categories| public attacks| industry evolution

We then assess how these employing firms vary in their designation of variable compensation  in the form of discretionary bonuses offered to MBA graduates  when graduates have or do not have a focused profile.   Based on a rich dataset of two graduating cohorts in 2008 and 2009 from an elite graduate school program, we find that individuals who construct focused profiles earn lower bonuses.  This effect is consistent regardless of whether the focus is in investment banking, marketing, or finance.  In demonstrating this penalty associated with focused profiles, we inform literature on early managerial careers and sociological theory related to identity.",identity| mbas| bonus compensation

Exploring the antecedents of category spanning,1|Tyler Earle Wry|Wharton School||,,"Within organization theory, the prevailing view of categories is of obdurate and discrete entities that shape actors identities and practices by setting boundaries and specifying what appropriately falls within them. Spanning multiple categories is thought to be detrimental because it makes an actors identity unclear and dilutes their focus. Still, straddling categories is an important driver of innovation and has implications for the emergence, evolution, and redirection of institutional fields. Despite this, understandings about the mechanisms which affect category spanning are limited.  Building on insights from structural approaches in cultural sociology, I provide evidence that evolving relationships among categories facilitate spanning by linking particular categories together in meaningful ways. Moreover, I show how the relational structure of categories is shaped endogenously by prominent actors in ways that condition the effects of alternate explanations based on category richness, networks, and social influence.",category| culture| structure

Few studies however, focus on the politics of value that is, the political process of establishing and controlling what and whose values matter in defining valuation criteria and subsequent value. A key part of this process, we argue involves constructing categories that guide valuation and perform value in markets. Category construction, rather than being a benign process, is a political accomplishment, in which both cultural and technical arguments as well as orders of worth are invoked to justify the selection of certain evaluative criteria constituting the category. Using two illustrations; sustainable coffee and champagne, we show how various actors, including firms, standard setters, and certifiers engage in category work and, by drawing on different economies of worth, infuse particular values into categories to shape valuation and value.",value| categories| french convention school

We induce a set of theoretical arguments using an analysis of the eBay marketplace between 2008 and 2009, following the creation of the new category of professional seller. These arguments state that members of a category make meaning of their function and build a collective identity informed by the function and identity assigned to them by a third party.

We study these mechanisms in the restaurant domain, analyzing menus and reviews of 2,125 restaurants located in San Francisco. Our results support previously untested assumptions: (1) category spanning decreases quality, (2) category spanning decreases typicality, and (3) typicality increases appeal.

Research on organizational categories has shown that audiences prefer organizations that conform to a single category. However, individual differentiation allows organizations to stand out within their category. This study examines this two-stage process of conformity followed by differentiation by investigating how categorical identity affects the way audiences react to individual identity features, specifically, moral identity. Using a series of lab experiments, results show that organizations in a single category gain appeal when they make a moral identity claim while organizations that span multiple categories garner less appeal for making the same moral identity claim. When no moral claim is made, however, organizations in a single category do not garner more appeal than their counterparts in multiple categories. These findings extend the current literature on organizational identity and challenge ideas about the cognitive process in which category penalties are meted out. An important implication of these results is that organizations in multiple categories can have difficulty cultivating idiosyncratic identities that would serve to differentiate them in the marketplace.",categories| identity| morality

In this research we study breach of contract in the context of SME financing using novel, hand-collected longitdunial data of over 450,000 SME loans (the entire population) made between 2002 - 2008 in one country. We propose theory that specifies how both the coherence and sequential consistency in contract enforcement style of a loan enforcement agent influences a loan recipients adherence to contractual provisions concerning payment. By proposing this theory and related empirical test we broaden the literature on categorical coherence by observing its applicability in direct exchanges rather than in mediated markets (Zuckerman 2004). In the process, we also provide a theoretical and empirical contrast of the effects of categorical coherence vis-a-vis sequential categorical consistencytwo concepts that have yet to be distinguished, and which we show should be.

When the number of products with salient names on the market increases, producers perceive competition as threatening and respond to this threat by increasing their product innovation.

Drawing on the resource partitioning model, I argue that large microbreweries do not alter their niche width, despite the fact that they are expanding into new competitive resource spaces and challenging generalist organizations. Furthermore, I introduce two identity-based strategies, identity entrenchment and enhancement, that allow these organizations to simultaneously compete in new resource spaces while maintaining organizational legitimacy as a craft brewer, and overall acceptance within the microbrewery social movement as a whole.",specialist organizations| identity| resource partitioning

Consistent with prior research, our findings indicate that the occurrence of a severe wrongdoing leads to lower support from low-identification stakeholders. Interestingly, and contrary to prior studies, while a mere occurrence of a severe wrongdoing does not lead to lower support from high-identification stakeholders, this group withdraws their support with an increase in the magnitude of wrongdoing.",organizational identification| stakeholder support| organizational wrongdoing

One important shortcoming in prior literature is to abstract too strongly from the strategic context in which the performance shortfall occurs and focusing on individual action categories. Faced with a performance shortfall firms frequently can engage in multiple courses of action and the likelihood to engage in any of these may depend on contingencies within the firm. Using data from 85 large companies in the ICT sector, we compare resource consuming acquisitions and resource freeing divestments as two polar types of risky actions, and slack resources as a moderator of the relationship between aspirations and these risky actions. In line with our predictions, we find that the strategic position of a company influences the available choice set of strategic moves when responding to performance short-falls.",aspirations| performance

Propositions are drawn based on analysis of the impact of control on ostensive and performative aspects of routines. Next, the strategies available to organizations to balance exploration and exploitation through mechanisms of control are discussed. Organizations are argued to be able to achieve architectural (i.e., separation-based) and contextual ambidexterity using modes of control to free or fix separate aspects of ostensive and perfomative aspects of routines.

This paper argues that while groups of specialists can quickly bring together knowledge from multiple domains in developing and implementing innovative ideas, a typical lack of system-wide perspective would prove to be a constraint over successive innovations.  In contrast, a single individual who acquires specialist knowledge in multiple domains would avoid this constraint, but would incur a penalty to acquire knowledge across domain boundaries upfront.  This leads to two opposing performance predictions on the performance of successive innovations: an inverted U-shape for the former and a U-shape for the latter.  Moreover, experience developing innovations in groups would weaken the performance for subsequent solo innovations.  These hypotheses are supported by empirical data on the download performance of third-party software applications written for use within the Facebook social networking context.",knowledge| learning| innovation

However, when search is studied, issues of individual agency and process have tended to reside backstage.

We take a different approach in this paper and use data gathered through in-depth fieldwork to challenge March and Simons (1958:50) foundational assumption that actors perceive the search environment to be benign. This assumption has remained implicit in subsequent research into intra-organizational search and requires revision. The fieldwork, conducted in a large mining conglomerate, identifies how social risk complicates the individual search process associated with intra-organizational learning and generates a search environment within capabilities that actors perceive to be non-benign. Problematizing the benign search environment assumption introduces an important boundary condition for predictions of local search bias and highlights an important new causal path connecting patterns of individual search to the evolution of higher-order trajectories of capability evolution.",intra-organizational search| capabilities| governance

We develop theory to explain the decision-making processes of organizational search by examining how organizations come to define and commit to changes in specific routines, given a multiplicity of routines involved in accomplishing an organizations work. We find that organizations did not necessarily commit to those changes in routines that would most improve performance. Instead, organizations committed to changes in routines that were politically feasible. Three principal findings from our research help explain the process and outcome of organizational search. First, individuals, grounded in their professional roles, frame problems and solutions that are meaningful to them given their work. This leads to both fragmented and conflicting frames across professional roles. Second, fragmented and conflicting frames are products of two distinct mechanisms. Fragmented frames are a product of differences in attention across professional roles, while framing conflicts are a product of jurisdictional competition across professional roles. Third, proposed changes in routines differed in their level of political contentiousness. Fragmentation was more easily overcome in organizational search than political conflict. As a result, organizations were less likely to commit to proposed changes in routines that became a source of jurisdictional competition, or led to framing conflict in the organizational search process.",organizational routines| organizational search| professions

OL involves a past-future disconnect because learning shows that the future is different from the present and the past in some way. The experience of the present and the past differs from the experience of the future giving rise to distinct sets of emotional reactions, leading to emotional ambivalence. In any learning cycle, negative emotions about experience of failure may lead to denial or self-protectiveness and so need to be tempered by positive emotions about experience of success. Whenever success is the context of learning the balance needs to be reversed to avoid over-confidence or complacency. We draw attention to shifts in ambivalent emotions at each OL stage and show how these are facilitated by stage-specific organizational learning mechanisms (OLMs). We define OL as the process of interpretation of ongoing organizational change. We argue that emotional ambivalence facilitates OL and we identify four functions in OL played by ambivalence. OL requires emotion management on two key dimensions  ability to withstand the emotional effects of learning-induced change and tolerance of emotional ambivalence.",organizational learning| emotional ambivalence

Organizational scholars have examined knowledge flows between organizations from R&D research, alliances, and acquisitions. Yet few studies have examined the construct as a metaphor and the movement of knowledge. The term knowledge flow implies that knowledge moves in an unrestricted manner. This imagery, however, conflicts with the study of fluid dynamics and advances in network and information studies.

Using a linguistic distance (from English) measure, we found those with a higher linguistic distance were more likely to contribute knowledge to, but only just as likely to acquire knowledge from their communities. This research indicates hiring workers who already possess a basic proficiency in a common language (e.g., English) is not a panacea for overcoming the difficulties of exchanging knowledge in a multinational organization.",knowledge transfer| language| hierarchy

According to causal attribution theory, these effects should be more severe if a director is member of the board's compensation committee. I find evidence based on a broad sample of firms and directors that such public criticism adversely impacts directorial tenure and the number of outside boards seats held.

The issues regarding failures in operationalization of this  admittedly difficult to operationalize  construct, which are regularly raised by several authors, seem to be neglected frequently. As most studies frequently operationalize dynamic capabilities in terms of their outcomes, mix constituent parts with effects, or do not explicitly measure them at all, theoretical implications are of limited value. It is about time that research focuses on the development and validation of a comprehensive measurement model of the key construct. This study thus develops and validates a multi-dimensional measurement model which comprehensively covers the relevant facets and allows for a differentiation between the key construct and its organizational outcomes. Thereby, the proposed measurement model, while clearly discriminating from its outcomes, is positively related to the development of operational capabilities and the establishment of capabilities of superior quality in different functional areas, i.e. marketing, technology, and organization.

The results of our structural equation model provide strong support for the trade-off between structural differentiation and cross-functional integration as well as their dissimilar influence on organizational ambidexterity. Whereas cross-functional integration is positively associated with both contextual ambidexterity and innovative ambidexterity, structural differentiation is negatively associated with contextual ambidexterity and positively associated with innovative ambidexterity.

The firm makes two such comparisons that inform its decision to engage in organizational change: performance relative to its own prior performance, and performance relative to that of other firms. The latter performance comparison relies upon the social aspiration point construct, which has received relatively little theoretical development. This paper seeks to fill that gap by extending the theoretical conceptualization and empirical specification of the socially derived performance targets against which organizations compare their performance. We argue that firms make social performance comparisons with a group of firms that is smaller than the whole industry and within that comparison group organizations monitor both an upwardly focused performance target and a downwardly anchored failure threshold. In addition to these performance thresholds which all organizations monitor, we propose that each organization monitors an upwardly biased and socially derived performance threshold that is closest to its own prior (i.e.,historic) performance. We investigate the relationship between organizational change and performance relative to these more fully specified performance targets in an empirical analysis of German soccer Bundesliga clubs between 1992 and 2004. We find that organizations have both upward and downward socially derived performance targets, and that the social aspiration point most proximate to historic performance is the most salient in driving organizational change.",behavioral theory| social aspirations| organizational change

Specifically, we suggest that moderately negative feedback activates an immune response in organizations, which leads decision makers to retain a course of action and exert extra effort to ensure its success.

The data from 48 pairs of successful and unsuccessful turnaround firms (total 96 firms) in this study marginally supported the classical strategic sequencing perspective but did not support the mediating model guided by the upper echelon perspective.  The data also strongly supported the punctuated equilibrium perspective of corporate turnaround, which suggests (a) that the punctuated leadership change in the form of CEO replacement is positively related to turnaround success and (b) that the positive CEO replacement  turnaround success relationship is moderated by the punctuated retrenchment and recovery actions (i.e., high-magnitude retrenchment and recovery actions taken in a relatively short time span).",corporate turnaround| punctuated equilibrium| corporate strategies

To address this research gap, we studied a merger of two European pharmaceutical companies in Mexico at two points of time: at the beginning of the integration process (time 1; t1) and in the later stage 36 months later (time 2; t2). We believe the findings make a very important contribution to understanding under which conditions intergroup conflict might further allow a progress towards a new, shared identity. The latter unfolds overtime via interplay of three non-sequential processes  1) change reinforcing post-merger identification; 2) dynamics of boundary permeability; 3) changing degree of nesting in terms of power and legitimacy.

Different authors claim that there is a need for an investigation of board directors individual, group and inter-group activities (Johnson & Pye 2007), of their behavioural structures and behavioural processes (Hambrick, von Werder & Zajac 2008), of their cognition and behaviour, including the political and bargaining processes within and between key corporate actors (Pugliese et al. 2009) as well as of their involvement in different settings (Hendry, Kiel & Nicholson 2010) in strategy making. We addressed these calls and conducted qualitative in-depth interviews with 64 CEOs and NEDs and 16 relevant other actors in 14 German public hospitals. The data analysis of 178 identified SDMPs allowed us to distinguish two inextricably intertwined processes. The impetus process, which is basically about collectivising, describes NEDs involvement in and exercise of power and influence from an actor perspective. In this respect, the following activities are detailed in this paper: interpretation making, mobilising, negotiating among the NEDs, negotiating with internal and external stakeholders and negotiating regarding action taking. The definition process, which is essentially about defining, focuses on a content perspective and elaborates on the following activities: goal developing, goal promoting, alternative generating, alternative selecting and implementing.

By focusing on a fundamental attribute of CEOs, their power, we seek to enhance understanding of not only how a CEO is able to exert his or her risk preferences but how those preferences arise. Integrating insights from the social psychology approach/inhibition theory of power with theory about risk taking in organizations we propose a theoretical model that has the potential to contribute a nuanced depiction of how micro-level (individual CEO) framing of strategic decision outcomes manifest as the collective level (organizational) risk taking actions.

Further, the relationship between directors resourceful interlinks and reemergence likelihood is curvilinear, such that too few and too many links reduce the likelihood of reemergence.

Yet, the question of where routines come from and how they arise has been treated rather cursorily and implicitly in the literature. Power is similarly absent from most discussions of organizational routines, even though power takes its most effective form in routines: it becomes unnecessary. Following the practice-based approach to routines (Feldman & Pentland, 2003) and employing concepts from the functional approach to power (Hickson, Hinings, Lee, Schneck, & Pennings, 1971; Salancik & Pfeffer, 1974), this paper develops a theoretical account of the role of power in the emergence of routines. In particular, the model highlights how existing vertical and horizontal power relations in the organization influence the emerging routine and in turn are inscribed in and preserved in the routine. As critical elements in emerging routines, artifacts are conceptualized as a source of power and a central locus of control where power struggles play out. The theoretical perspective developed in this paper contributes to building the micro-foundations of organizational routines and shows how processes of institutionalization are inextricably linked to power.",organizational routines| power| emergence

Using both a fixed effects panel and a career based approach, rival hypotheses are tested.  In addition to the pay-performance relationship, the probability of job loss as a function of performance is also evaluated. The evidence presented points to the importance of institutional considerations in the standard agency theory and managerial power perspectives, and lends support to a social theory of agency.  The analysis is empirical in nature and an effort is made to draw on qualitative studies to further flesh out the findings.  The practical implications of the findings point to the dangers of relying on individual boards to exercise restraint in the area of executive pay.  Also highlighted is the distinct advantage of boards adopting a cumulative or career-oriented approach when evaluating executive performance  From a policy perspective, the case is made for truly long term incentives, in the form of `Career Shares'.

Yet extant research which has employed a resource dependence perspective has assumed that a firms dependence on the government uniformly affects how it engages in political activity.  The research presented here argues that firms experience two distinct types of government dependence, threat-related dependence and opportunity-related dependence, which in turn affect how they engage in corporate political activity. By combining ideas from research in strategic categorization with resource dependence theory, this paper defines these two unique types of dependence and predicts how firms would respond to each type. Support for these predictions is found examining the federal lobbying investments of large, U.S.-based firms from 2000 through 2009.",resource dependence| strategic categorization theory| corporate political activity

Our analysis suggests that goal-oriented simulated annealing algorithms might better model managers search behavior. Substituting simulated annealing algorithms for hill-climbing algorithms will alter the behavior of some computational models, and could thus provide new insights in fields as diverse as organizational structure, strategy, and technology innovation. When appropriate, we recommend that future computational models explicitly discuss which algorithm best represents backward-looking search in the phenomenon under study.

Posen|U. of Michigan||2|Dirk Martignoni|U. of Zurich||3|Daniel Levinthal|U. of Pennsylvania||,,"Boundedly rational organizations engage in search and experiential learning. Because organizations are resource constrained, they must trade-off the long-term benefits of exploration against the near-term benefits of exploitation. As a consequence, the benefits of experiential learning come at the cost of a myopic tendency to overlook alternatives that are distant or uncertain. We consider the implications of relaxing this resource constraint by increasing the number of agents in the organization, making possible parallel learning. To do so, we extend the multi-arm bandit model, which is the canonical representation of exploration and exploitation, to a multi- agent organizational setting by assuming that agents within an organization act based not only on their own experience, but also on the experience of others in the organization. This model gives rise to three stylized facts about larger organizations: (a) they explore less than do smaller organizations, (b) they are less likely to discover the very best alternative, and (c) they exhibit superior performance on average, even though their chosen alternatives may not be the very best. Thus, rather than reducing myopia, increasing organizational size generates unintended consequences that, on important dimensions of performance, amplify rather than diminish myopia in experiential learning.",learning| exploration| exploitation

In keeping with typical behavioural formulations of organizational adaptation we formulate a model in which an organizations strategy adapts based on performance feedback.  However, the distinctive feature of our approach is that we abandon the organization as a unitary actor assumption, and model a separation of beliefs and actions. Independent of the usual exploration-exploitation problem, this gives rise to an inference problem for the strategist: whether to revise strategy or try to implement it again, given poor performance. We show that this implies that effective implementation dominates the benefits of exploration through imperfect implementation in most situations. This offers one explanation for the implementation imperative that seems widespread in managerial practice.",strategy implementation| organization design| organization structure

The proposed theory, constructed with dynamic modeling based on the literature, can explain causally shifts in organizational attention as well as stasis. Through simulated explorations, we find that interacting self-reinforcing patterns are critical both to adapting attention to new stimuli and to retaining attention on a particular focus.

Drawing on strategic leadership and moral licensing research, we address this gap by considering the dynamic relationship between CSR and CSiR. We predict that prior CSR is positively associated with subsequent CSiR because CSR bolsters leaders moral identity, which enables them to engage in less ethical stakeholder treatment without harming their sense of moral self worth. Further, we hypothesize that extraverted leaders will be less likely to engage in CSiR because they are more aware of and more vocal about stakeholders needs. Lastly, we predict that CSR and extraversion jointly affect CSiR, such that the relationship between extraversion and CSiR will be stronger under conditions of low prior CSR.

Adaptationists have been generally focusing on the theoretical developing and empirical testing of many assumptions associated with the interdependence relationship between organizations and their task (i.e., competitive) or general (i.e., society) environment. Also, these scholars have accounted for all those decision making processes that are more specifically associated with the survival problems of newborn organizations, as well as with their environmental fit (or failure) within their overall life cycle. This timely critical review aims at discussing where this literature is to date, and where it could be moving towards in the future.",organizational adaptation| review| survival

Our theory of social inference explains why CEOs tend to select new directors who have prior interlock ties to other similar CEOs. We then suggest that the tendency for CEOs to select such new directors is stronger when director candidates are demographically more different from CEOs. Moreover, we also address an important consequence of this social inference process for corporate governance by explaining why new directors' prior interlock ties to other similar CEOs may make it less likely for the CEO's demographic difference from new directors to negatively influence the CEO's compensation. Longitudinal analysis of Fortune 500 companies' new director selections and subsequent CEO compensation provided strong support for our theoretical expectations.",board of director| ceo| interlock network

We argue that the increasing involvement of corporations in soft law initiatives (SLI)  private regulation mechanisms issuing CSR standards or codes of conduct  impacts on both routes of CSR-based activism. Activists can target corporations with regard to their (non-) engagement in SLIs, or target SLIs to bring about field-level change. Borrowing the concept of opportunity structures from the social movement literature, this paper conceptualizes how SLIs influence the opportunities and constraints for both routes of CSR-based activism. We argue that soft law opportunity structures are composed of organizational characteristics of an SLI (e.g. its institutional structure), relational characteristics of this SLI with regard to its field (e.g. its centrality), and soft law field characteristics (e.g. density).",soft law| activism| csr

Brenner|Copenhagen Business School||,,"Why do executives of some firms attract more public moral judgment than others for similar moral transgressions? Despite the potentially severe consequences of moral judgment for firms and managerial careers, this question has received scant research attention. We hypothesize that moral standards at which executives are held are more stringent if their firms are perceived as ""good''. This holds because in such a context, a moral transgression by executives gives rise to an inconsistency in moral conduct and induces the perception of hypocrisy. Using data of large, listed U.S. companies, we test the hypothesis that CEOs of firms with high scores in corporate philanthropy are more likely to receive negative media attention when their pay contract violates distributive justice norms. Our evidence is affirmative. We also argue and show that prosocial conduct along moral domains unrelated to the transgression (e.g., diversity and environment) and prosocial conduct that raises doubts about the severity of the transgression help to license the transgression and reduce the likelihood of public outcry. Finally, we find evidence that executives seem to care for morally consistent conduct since public judgment only triggers a significant subsequent drop in excessive pay in situations characterized by hypocrisy.",moral standards| executive compensation| corporate social responsibility

As a result, competing moral orders pervade organizations. Studies of morals and organizations show that communities in contested areas defend one unique moral perspective in order to ensure public acceptance and organizational survival. However, this does not explain how competing moral orders might influence continuing action within these communities. Indeed as such communities embed themselves within a strong moral perspective, they are left with scant room for continuing creativity and change. Through a 16-months ethnography, I examine the Stem Cell community as a trouble case: after advocating for the morality of using human embryos for research, the community invented a technology which bypassed the use of embryos. I find that while stem cell scientists presented a unified public front, they locally held diverse moral positions and embedded these views in the infrastructure of science by creating new technologies. In this case, local divergences over ethics shaped innovation and change. This paper contributes to our understanding of morals and organizations by showing that moral understandings are not just mobilized as post-hoc justifications of organizational products or practices but are integral to the constitution of these products and practices.",change| ethics| innovation

Firms in these markets face a constant challenge to balance two competing motivations that underlie institutional demands:  the rationale to economic efficiency, and the defense of values and norms. I study the effects of institutional factors such as cultural values, and organizational strategic and structural factors on market participation. Empirically, I study European firms choices either to reduce emissions in-house, or to participate in the carbon credit market. The latter is an economically efficient instrument but a heavily contested one, based on two moral claims:  first, that environment is a sacred good, and second, that a carbon market allows the wealthy to evade their responsibilities.  My findings suggest a strong cultural norm effect, indicating that the prevailing attitudes in a firms headquartered country may predict its choices on whether to engage in the carbon credit market.  Firms in countries where people express more skepticism toward market mechanisms in environmental policy are less likely to engage in the carbon market.  The channel specifically regards the cultural norms that reflect attitudes toward environmental-economic trade-offs, and not the norms reflecting concern about the environment in general.  The results also suggest that the defense of cultural norms matters more in firms choices when there exists high levels of external pressure from domestic consumers, and matters less when powerful regulative force provides justification for market participation.",value| market| carbon

In particular, the leadership and human interaction aspects of organizing and their role in the development of organizational and managerial capabilities have been identified as an under researched area. This paper addresses this gap. Using complexity-informed theories of human interaction dynamics (HID), the paper defines leadership as the process that evolves organizational capabilities. More specifically, it describes three leadership processes that serve three system survival functions, and it identifies three mechanisms that operate locally to enable organizing through local interactions within a complex adaptive system. In sum, leadership evolves the ways in which individuals interact with one another to survive and prosper as collectives. It thus shapes the particular expression of dynamic, operating and managerial capabilities that emerge from these interactions within the ecosystem.

Those works that have studied scapegoating have only examined cases in which internal scapegoats were chosen to take the blame for organizational failures, and these scapegoats were usually executives. We extend this area of research by examining the use of external scapegoats to counter legitimacy threats that might otherwise imperil the employment of firm executives. Using a sample of public company financial restatements from 2005 to 2010, we test what factors impact the scapegoating of external auditing firms, and whether such scapegoating reduces the hazard that CEOs and CFOs will exit their firms. Our results indicate that scapegoating is more likely when the magnitude of the restatement and the prestige of the auditor are low. Also, as expected, scapegoating reduces the hazard of firm exit for both CEOs and CFOs, the executives most closely linked to financial statements. In addition, scapegoating is more effective for CEOs when they do not simultaneously serve as their boards Chairman.",scapegoating| top managers| external advisors

However, the process does not necessarily end with the outcome of selection. Rather, an important determinant of whether each side receives the benefits from the selection decision is the stability of the match between the two parties. In this regard, the director and board continue to evaluate their fit with one another and other potential matches, which in turn, determine the match stability. This paper sets out to examine the interaction of both sides by applying matching theory to consider the stability of director-board matches. From this theoretical perspective, we consider the antecedents to match instability and the outcome of this instability, match dissolution.

To do this I examine some definitions and describe the four main types of metatheoretical research. Illustrative MOS examples of each of these types are presented. Common critiques of metatheorising are discussed and arguments offered in support of metatheorising as a valid and useful form of research. Some methods for performing meta-level research are synthesised in the form of a general qualitative method for metatheorising and an example is given of a metatheoretical procedure that can be used to build, critique and integrate MOS theory.

The five factors were: 1) Championing behaviors, 2) pricing capabilities, 3) organizational confidence, 4) organizational change capacity, and 5) center-led pricing management. Results demonstrate that all five factors positively and significantly influence relative performance, suggesting that pricing champions able to design organizations and allocate resources in a way that maximizes pricing capability can achieve superior financial outcomes.

In parallel, quality management has been widely applied by many firms. We propose a theory explaining the link between these two trends. We argue that the process approach associated with quality management initiatives introduces a more detailed conceptual understanding of firm internal activities and generates a terminology enhancing the comparability of internal process performance with external options. Thus, quality practices facilitate the adoption of outsourcing. We link quality management with previously established drivers of outsourcing, namely information technology and internationalization. Therefore, to some extent, we view increased outsourcing as a byproduct of quality management practices neglected in prior studies.Using the decision to outsource R&D activities, we test our theory using an unbalanced panel of Spanish firms over the period of 1990-2008. The results generally support our theory: we show that the decision to invest in R&D externally is positively associated with prior quality management initiatives. Moreover, quality management and IT investment have complementary effect on R&D outsourcing. The empirical results support predominance of the impact of quality management over IT investment.",firm boundaries| quality management| outsourcing

While the importance of culture is widely acknowledged in the workplace violence and aggression literature, much of the existing research has focused on individual level antecedents, leaving the role of culture under-theorized. By integrating micro-institutional theory with empirical research on incivility spirals and spillovers, we outline how a continuum of negative interpersonal workplace behaviors  from mundane incivility to workplace violence  is connected through organizational culture. Through culture, mundane negative behaviors support and perpetuate institutions enabling the extreme behaviors. Using this theoretical framework, this paper identifies a potential flaw in current workplace violence prevention efforts and presents a possible solution. The potential flaw is the severity threshold separating behaviors warranting attention from those that are neglected. The possible solution requires addressing behaviors along the entire continuum.

Leadership behavior is classified according to three categories, namely empowering, mobilizing, and embracing. Generally, empowering seems to have the most important influence on the effectiveness of the cluster management due to an increase in the number of member companies and a higher member satisfaction.

The article also tackles a conceptual puzzle about the effects of cross-training on the networks of male versus female employees: one perspective suggests that females will derive greater network benefit, while another view predicts the opposite effect. Semi-structured interviews with 40 past program participants and a longitudinal field experiment involving 91 participants in a cross-training program at a software development laboratory in China and 85 matched non-participants reveal that:  (1) relative to non-participants, participants in cross-training reported an expansion in activated social networks; (2) the implicit collaborative self-concept positively moderated the effects of cross-training on the proportion of bridging ties reported by participants; and (3) relative to male employees, female employees reported a greater increase in activated ties.

Then in Study 2 we draw on social constructionism and reflective knowledge building theory to establish how, controlling for prior performance, each type of assistance might either help or hurt the provider's current performance. We theorize that those types of assistance that are more likely to encourage positive reflection by the provider concerning his or her own situation will lead to higher performance by the provider. Using a bounded network survey in a large consulting firm, we find the expected positive returns for providing assistance with problem solving, purpose, and initially with career assistance; the expected negative returns for personal and too much career assistance; but no effect for information or political assistance.

We begin with an overview of different positions on responsible leadership (RL) that have been defined by prior literature. Then we examine qualitatively how these different approaches resonate with business leaders and get translated into leadership practice. From this study, we develop a frameworkthe Matrix of Responsible Leadership Mindsets that represents the core narratives of practitioners. This matrix consists of two dimensionsintentions and performance focus which create a space for locating the four different mindsets: an enlightened economist, an opportunity seeker, an altruist, and an integrator. After we reveal the distinctive differences in the RL mindsets held by various business leaders, we discuss to what extent these different mindsets affect actual decision making and the construction of public trust. We conclude that a new narrative of integrative responsible leadership that emerges from the practical discourse has the potential to strengthen the contract between business and societyand thus help close the trust gap. We also reflect on why this new narrative is difficult to understand from the instrumental point of view that underlies most management and leadership theories. Finally, we reflect on some consequences for leadership development and management education.",mindset| responsible leadership| csr

We test our hypotheses in two studies of managers.  Results suggest that not only does social consensus determine whether an individual relies on moral cognitions about the issue or concerns about others when deciding to act, but also that an individuals view of self is an important moderator in these relationships.

They are said to support employees moral development and stimulate exemplary ethical conduct. This paper, however, problematizes this understanding. From a Foucauldian perspective, we argue that values-based ethics programs work as a form of control that both enables and restricts individuals ethical conduct and moral agency and thereby possibly involve morally problematic relations of power. The paper contributes primarily to the literature on ethics programs as tools for management control by proposing an analytical framework for exploring and discussing the multifaceted and possibly insidious forms and relations of power that values-based ethics programs involve. We develop and illustrate this framework by means of an empirical case study that focuses on the Amway Corporation.

This paper is based on an extensive content analysis and counter-accounting of 23 sustainability reports from firms in the energy and mining sectors which had received application levels of A or A+ from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). The 2,700 pages of information disclosed in the reports was structured around 92 GRI indicators and compared with 116 significant news events clearly calling into question the responsibility of these firms with regard to sustainable development. Moreover, 1258 pictures included in sustainability reports were categorized into recurring themes. The counter-accounting analysis showed that 90% of significant negative events were not reported contrary to the principles of balance, completeness and transparency of GRI reports. Moreover, the pictures included in these reports were clearly disconnected with the impacts of business activities.

However, bribery investigations weaken firms' subsequent corporate reputations demonstrating that buffering comes with a cost.

This article separates ownership, control, and managerial facets of family involvement and combines a quantitative longitudinal study of Fortune 500 companies between 2004 and 2009 with a qualitative comparative study of more than 70 letters to shareholders. As a whole, this paper suggests that identity-related components of family corporate involvement positively affect the treatment of organizational members. Moreover, the qualitative approach illustrates that the organizational identity of family firms emphasizes both agreed-upon values of a group and human related factors. As a boundary to this overall positive effect of family groups, we show that the effect of family control acts along a curvilinear pattern and that family management has mixed effects on employee relations.

The weakness of governance mechanisms allowed for moral hazard and permitted risky new processes and products, which exacerbated the situation. We discuss suggestions to reduce tendencies toward excessive risk taking through the re-calibration of corporate governance mechanisms.

Patterns of activity codes sites were compared using cluster analysis in order to characterize the activity patterns of navigators across the ten sites.  The resulting clusters were compared with qualitative data related to those codes in order to elaborate and illustrate the differences between the activity patterns.  This analysis revealed six distinct patterns of navigation which varied in use across the eight programs.

As a contribution to clos-ing this gap, the findings of a cross-national and cross-sectoral comparative study into corporate reporting on anti-corruption measures are presented here. The results show that the strongest indicator of whether or not a company reports on its engagement with the challenge of corruption is  contrary to expectation  neither the level of corruption in its country nor the extent to which its specific sector is exposed to corruption. Instead, the reporting style the company has adopted appears to be most influential, which in turn is shaped by general country and regional-level differences in sustainability reporting.

There is tension in gaining commitment from competing stakeholder groups, in sustaining public engagement in technically complex areas, and securing democratic support. At the same time, leadership scholars have increasingly called for a need to examine leadership in ways that go beyond individual roles and leader follower exchange relationships. Our paper seeks to make such a development by examining leadership practice in the context of policy formulation.  We contribute a socio-material approach as a novel lens into leadership practice; we examine how and why leadership is distributed across multiple material and social actors which together reconfigure practices and coalitions.  In so doing we also show how legitimacy and trust are socio-materially enacted and (re)shape leadership practice.",distributed leadership| health policy| sociomaterial

Product recalls are crisis situations facing firms wherein the key stakeholders of the firm exhibit conflicting reactions to organizational responses to the crisis.  This conflict leaves firms in a dilemma when it comes to recall timing decisions since such decisions signal the extent of responsibility that the firms assume for the crisis. Drawing on the literatures on crisis management and product recalls, and on inputs from agency theory and signalling theory, we argue that firms avoid signalling responsibility for the crisis by delaying recalls. This overall argument is used to predict the effects of crisis factors, such as hazard severity and ambiguity on recall timing decisions of firms and their salience in the context of organizational characteristics, such as design defects and recall experience.  We tested our proposal on a dataset of U.S. toy recalls for the period 1988-2011.

Second, our analysis suggests that this coexistence of couplings enables MSIs to generate policy outcomes which address the conditions of a transnational regulatory context. We characterize this context as the post-Westphalian setting and argue that MSIs way of organizing enables them to cope with three challenges in particular: the stability, flexibility and legitimacy of governance. Reflecting on these challenges, we also identify a number of problems related to MSIs role in transnational governance.

The literature distinguishes three strategies that corporations commonly employ to address legitimacy problems: adapt to external expectations, try to manipulate the perception of their stakeholders or engage in a discourse with those who question their legitimacy. This paper investigates when and how corporations should apply these different strategies, a question that has so far been largely neglected. We suggest that corporations have to be able to activate all three legitimacy strategies, despite their inherent incompatibilities.

In this sense, it can be observed since the late 90, a great emergence of philanthropic actions by the part of private companies as well as the intensification of activities of civil society organizations. Twenty years ago we observed two worlds  that of business and that of civil society  very distant, with high resistance to work collaboratively. Besides the phenomenon of intersectoral alliances, it is possible also to remark the arising of a new kind of organization that brings together two goals that were once seen as incompatible: financial sustainability and social value creation. Social Enterprises, inclusive businesses and social businesses are some of the terms currently used to explain the organizations that aim to solve social problems with efficiency and financial sustainability by means of market mechanisms. It can be said that Inclusive Business are those aimed at generating employment and income for groups with little or no market mobility, within the pattern of the so-called decent job in self-sustaining, that is, generating profits for the enterprises, establishing relationships with typical business organizations, either in the condition of products and services suppliers or in the distribution of such production of enterprises or traditional business. This article discusses the different concepts that appear on the scientific literature about Inclusive Businesses, highlighting emphasis and approaches that contribute to the explanation of this phenomenon. It analyses also the data from a survey carried out with participants in regional seminars focusing social enterprise responsibility promoted by FIEMG. This analysis reveals that perspectives, risks and idealizations similar to those present in theorizing on Inclusive Business also can be found among individuals engaged with the operation of projects with social corporate responsibility, even if such a designation is new for them. The connection between company, market and poverty, especially in the ways of Inclusive Business seems full of stumbles and traps, either in theory or in the praxis on the Brazilian context. The following topics in this article give more body and complexity to this statement. With regard to inclusive business there seems to be a greater concern with the issue of poverty, surpassing previous positions of little engagement with this problem by the companies. It is important to deepen the theorical and conceptual discussions from this perspective of corporate social responsibility, especially in the Brazilian context, a country that has shown significant changes in the condition of the poor in the recent years, as well as advances in studies of experiences to promote inclusive business.",inclusive business| poverty| corporate social responsibility

However, only a few social enterprises are able to successfully scale up and most of them remain restricted as a small localized initiative. One of the most important reasons for inability to scale up are the human resource challenges, which has two aspects (1) lack of availability of committed and skilled human resource and (2) a concern that scaling up may lead to dilution of organizational values and culture, due to which the organization may lose its focus on its vision. In spite of these constraints some organizations are able to successfully scale up without selling out on their values and culture. In this study, through an empirical investigation into scaled up social enterprises involved in delivering affordable health care services for the poorer section of the society, we attempt to explore how social enterprises scale up their services, expand their human resource base and yet maintain the values and culture that drive the organization. The study contributes to the social entrepreneurship literature by providing useful insights on addressing a unique trade off faced in scaling up, namely, to scale up their services and yet remain rooted to the organizational values and culture.",social entreprise| scaling up| organizational culture

The comparative social policy aim is to examine and account for observed employment relations variance in the U.S. and Japan, given their similar labor legislation. Japans Supreme Court recognizes lifetime employment as an institutionalized practice and we report all 236 references to the term lifetime employment in Japanese case law: 178 regional cases, 43 regional superior cases, and 15 Supreme Court cases. Quantitative analysis of Supreme Court cases contextualizes these references in post-World War II history; qualitative analysis focuses on the Court's discourse. Causally related to this recognition, management councils (a form of employee participation in managerial prerogative) are also a defining feature of Japanese employment relations at the enterprise level. Despite unionization rate declines in both nations, the persistence of Japan's participatory employee relations system contrasts sharply with recent U.S. state-based legislative assaults on long-standing collective bargaining, particularly for public sector unions. The concept of cultural cognition, recently deployed in legal studies to account for domestic U.S. risk, public policy and voting preferences, offers theoretical grounds for better understanding of the observed comparative variance in employment practices.

However, little is known about how investors select SRIs in which to invest and how they allocate funds to their chosen SRIs.  In the present study, we use a structured experimental approach to determine if the decision-making process of investors to invest in SRIs is consistent with the decision-making used for conventional investments.  Our theoretical framework is based on two widely studied concepts in the decision-making and investment literature, inertia and discounting.  We discover that inertia plays a significant role in the selection of SRI funds.  Specifically, our sample of 704 respondents maintained a high level of consistency with the risk/return profile of their current investments when making choices about SRIs.  However, we also found that investors systemically discounted the value of SRIs and invested a lower proportion of their funds in SRIs compared to conventional investments with a similar risk/return profile. Furthermore, the level of discounting of SRIs was positively related to the risk level of the investments.   Our results imply that SRIs need to be designed to cater to the risk/return profiles of investors and that these investors need to be better informed about the performance of SRIs versus conventional investments in order to reduce their systematic discounting.",investments| experiments| social responsibility

A second level result highlights collective beliefs for RI which drive the mimetic process of conventions. The case of RI mainstreaming illustrates the importance of studying mimetic processes at a meso-level (Orlean, 2006), in addition to the standard, organizational level mimetic processes (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983).

Social enterprises that have the social value in the output experience much less tension between the social and the economic objectives than social companies that their social impact focus is on the input or process.",social enterprise| tension| social entrepreneurship

With 19 years of data, 349 companies and 6,334 firm-year observations, the findings reveal that the overall growth level of CSR, while significant, has not been substantive over the last two decades. Furthermore, unlike previous studies, this paper demonstrates that membership in a high discretion industry is not an important determinant of the strategic choice to adopt positive CSR initiatives, nor has there been increased isomorphism in the adoption of CSR activities over time. To the contrary, firm level adoption of CSR initiatives demonstrate increased heterogeneity, not homogeneity over time.

Larger firms seem to have advantages regarding the use of CSP for means of recruitment. However, against our initial assumption we found that firm size negatively moderates the impact of CSP on current employees.

This framing encompasses, in this case, shifts in leadership discourse as the company transitioned from its founding era to professional management through to its acquisition, subsequent integration into a parent company, and the aftermath.  This longitudinal frame helps to uncover the changing nature and drivers of a firms SROI through a specific focus on how its leaders presented its mission and values to the workforce and to the public. Key findings reveal that while Ben & Jerrys projected identity endures over time and through the Unilever acquisition in that the three part mission remains a pillar of the firms identity, what does change is the way various leaders interpret and make their own this three part mission, thus supporting the idea that organizational identity can display both stability and change. Findings reveal that the relationship between a normative versus utilitarian organizational identity is best conceived as dialectical with both impulses continuously at play.

This paper describes the process through which inter-cohort stakeholder conflicts arise: unobserved behavior leads to inaccurate valuations of organizational activities and earlier stakeholders benefit at the expense of later cohorts. Latency in the observation of impropriety motivates dysfunction by compensating actions that are inconsistent with the long-term interests of the firm or its stakeholders. One solution is to accept that historical calculations of risk and reward will often be inaccurate, and to settle accounts later by taking back ill-gotten gains. This is the practical spirit of the legal innovation known as clawbacks, found in bankruptcy proceedings and in compensation contracts. Relying upon these innovations to theorize an alternative system of governance, this paper considers how an economy of traceable currency could facilitate reclamation and accountability to alleviate inter-cohort tensions between stakeholders. The proposed ETHO$ economy formalizes the informal practices of responsible procurement and conscientious consumption into a new set of institutional arrangements that rationalize property within the firm. Most importantly, under these arrangements the incentives for excessive risk are moderated by a scheme of personal accountability and network governance.",clawbacks| stakeholders| property rights

In many countries healthcare reform has concentrated on structural change, cost containment, the introduction of market mechanisms and consumer choice. Despite efforts from policy makers, politicians and communities, healthcare systems are substantially unaltered. In this paper we argue that research and developments in business and human resource management (HRM) have not been transferred to the healthcare sector, despite the widely held belief that management matters in delivering quality healthcare outcomes. The key lesson from the HRM literature is that investing in developing and maintaining effective HRM builds a well-motivated and appropriately skilled workforce that makes significant and measurable positive contributions to organizational performance. In the same way, the approach taken to manage human resources in healthcare could be a facilitator (or major constraint) to achieving the objectives of health sector reform. We draw on HRM control theory to examine current practice in hospitals because research consistently suggests that the health sector adopts a control orientation to people management and there is a need to understand existing practice before recommendations for change can be made. We employ multilevel and grounded theory approach to explicate the complexities of the various forms of control and HRM climate. Our findings reveal major themes elucidating not only the forms of control adopted in hospitals but the specific conditions in which these controls are used. Results also highlight how forms of control employed in hospitals influence the climate and strength of the HRM system and perceptions of HRM professionals.

A mixed methodological approach that combined interviews with clinical and administrative actors and statistical analysis of 405 non-routine adverse events that occurred at the hospital over a 30-month period was employed to identify factors associated with corrective action prescription and completion. Analysis of qualitative and quantitative data indicated that corrective action planning and implementation in response to adverse events were shaped by institutional influences on the hospitals quality management practices, predominantly state-level regulation that required corrective action for externally-reportable events and professional norms that discouraged organizational intervention in autonomous clinician practice.  In logistic regression models, odds of planning a corrective action in response to an adverse event increased with regulatory reportability of the event, litigation risk of the event, number of departments involved in the event, and full or partial event causation by protocol violation or coordination error. Severity of injury to the patient was not identified as a predictor of corrective action planning.  The odds of corrective action implementation were greater for action types involving remedial retraining or reinforcement of standards and those involving interventions in the task environment, while corrective actions involving interventions in professional roles and interactions were associated with a statistically-significant decreased odds of completion.  Rates of completion were generally low across action categories, which interviews and medical case data analysis indicate may have been a product of diffuse responsibility for implementation among practicing clinicians untrained in process change, unrealistic action planning, and normative barriers to intervention in professional practice.

It shows that in spite of epistemic and status differences, multiprofessional communities of practice can develop and professional boundaries between general practitioners, practice nurses and practice managers co-located in the same organisation can be successfully bridged without major tensions or conflict. While knowledge circulates relatively easily within these multiprofessional communities of practice, barriers to knowledge sharing emerge at the boundary separating them from other groups existing in the same organisation. The strongest boundaries, however, lie between individual general practices, with inter-organisational knowledge sharing and collaboration between them remaining unequally developed across different areas due to historical factors, competition and strong organisational identification. Manipulated emergence of multi-organisational communities of practice in the context of primary care may thus be problematic. This is likely to affect the implementation of the primary care reform currently implemented in the English National Health Service, underscores the importance of facilitation in addressing organisational boundaries, and suggests that inter-organisational learning, collaboration and knowledge sharing in primary care landscape should get more attention from researchers.",communities of practice| boundaries| primary care

We find that a high proportion of private pathology services that are capital intensive and amenable to standardisation and economies of scale are provided by public corporations. By contrast, although public corporations share of the diagnostic imaging market also increased over time, this trend has begun to reverse itself, with the recent emergence of new, independent, smaller firms. Although also capital intensive, diagnostic imaging services are not amenable to production-linked economies of scale; indeed, over time, the cost of professional inputs had an overriding effect on efficiency improvements. We conclude that the public corporation is an effective form of governance for the delivery of medical services that are capital intensive and can attain economies of scale and standardisation. In contrast, the partnership, or private organisation more generally, may be a more effective form of governance for the delivery of customised medical services that rely on highly qualified professionals.",healthcare professional service firms| governance and ownership| organisational design

This problem has been broadly characterized as change implementation failure in healthcare organizations (HCOs).This prospective implementation-research study sought to understand which structures of communication and types of knowledge exchanges are associated with successful implementation of evidence-based practices in HCOs. The study was set in two ICUs at an academic medical center. At baseline, both units had low compliance with CLB and higher-than-expected CRBSIs. The aim was to promote implementation of CLB in both units through periodic quality improvement interventions over a 52-week period, and simultaneously examine: 1) Structure and content of communication related to CLB in both units through communication logs completed weekly by nurses, physicians, and managers; and 2) Outcomes, i.e., CLB compliance in both units through weekly chart review.    During the course of the study, both units experienced substantially improved CLB compliance and significantly reduced CRBSI rates. Preliminary analysis of 40 weeks of communication data in both units reveals intensification of communication over time across frontline subgroups (i.e., nurses and physicians), and dramatic changes in content exchanged, from reactive protocol-based checks to proactive communications for reducing infection risk.  Moreover, the prospective design provides insights into effective communication network structures for learning and culture change at the unit level. Overall, the study lays a foundation for generating evidence-based management strategies for successful implementation of change at the frontlines of care delivery.",hospital infection prevention| communication networks| evidence-based management for learning and change

However, there is no study that proposes a thorough, system-wide and solid methodology to measure hospital patient flows performance. With the present contribution we try to fill this gap on the basis of the results of a longitudinal benchmarking study that has involved six different Italian hospitals. We propose an analytical framework to measure patient flows performance organized around three different levels: (i) hospital system; (ii) hospital pipelines and (iii) production units. First of all, we stress the fact that any patient flows strategy need to be contextualized within the general hospital configuration. Secondly, it is important to carefully considering all the possible interdependencies that exist between the different hospital production units. From the results of our benchmarking study it exists a correlation between the ED length of stay and the ratio between inpatients and outpatients and the proportion of patients discharged by noon. Finally, we stress the importance of measuring patient flows variability. On this regard our data clearly shows that urgent/unscheduled cases are less variable and much more predictable compared to elective case.",patient flows logistics| operations management| hospital

I identify three major themes of relevance to the process of decision-making: the forms of knowledge underpinning decisional interactions; the forms of discourse drawn upon to frame and justify decisions; and the tools and technology available to health care actors and consumers, which represent instantiations of accumulated medical knowledge. These themes are supplemented by consideration of key aspects of both the medical setting and the sociocultural context within which medical work occurs. I suggest that knowledge, discourse, and technology exist in a reciprocal relationship, with each exerting an influence on the other two while simultaneously being acted upon in a similar manner. Conceivable future research directions include the following: more nuanced consideration of notions of power and hegemony in clinical encounters; continued attention to the ways through which patient-specific knowledge and values are incorporated into the decision process; examination of expanding notions of patienthood (particularly as regards the role of the family in medical decision-making); and the effect on decision-making patterns of new technological innovations. I conclude by briefly discussing the possibility of building upon the principles of structuration theory (Giddens, 1984; Sewell, 1992) to expand conceptual insights into clinical decision-making.",decision-making| technology| structuration theory

Emerging from the literature in organizational knowledge, the resource-based view of the firm and the newer ideas of dynamic capabilities, the ideas surrounding capability transfer generate much excitement in this field of organizational studies.In this paper, we subject this term to scrutiny, using the construct of imperialism.  We contend that discussions  of capability transfer mask issues of power and privilege, of exploitation and exclusion, and significantly, imperialism.  Imperialism can be defined as a special case of exploitation, where the appropriator of surplus value functions by shifting the locus of exploitation into specific geographical areas, for the gratification of other geographies.   We contend that much of the activities that undergird the issues of capability transfer in MNCs can be seen through the lens of imperialism.We ground our theoretical framework in an ethnographic study that analyzes the transfer of capabilities in a single corporation.  The results of our empirical research strengthen and deepen our theoretical framework.  We argue that ultimately, the terrain of capability transfer remains the site of multiple imperialisms, spatially and temporally anchored and dynamic.  Critical researchers need to highlight in our research that the regimes of capability transfer make unreasonable and exploitative demands of the subaltern subject.  The paper tries to tell a new story of capability transfer, of political economy, and the changing landscape of industrial accumulation.",capability| imperialism| international

Emphasis is given to the logic of appropriateness associated with institutionalism. Four different institutionalist lenses are developed and applied to the empirical findings.

However, our review of the available measures for diversity faultline strength reveals that none of them delivers a deductive metric for diversity faultline strength if more than two homogeneous subgroups are present, partly due to computational limitations. Further, a comparison of existing methods based on simulation data reveals that current methods underestimate the faultline strength if more than two subgroups are present in the data. We thus propose a new cluster-based method for calculating a measure of diversity faultline strength. The method, which is based on the average silhouette width (ASW), is suitable for larger groups and for a number of subgroups that is only limited by the total number of group members. We evaluate the properties of the proposed measure with simulation data and compare it with existing measures. Results show that the proposed measure responds to changes in team structure in desired ways. Our ASW-based faultline measure thus overcomes the limitations of current approaches and makes the faultline metric available for new areas of organizational research.",faultlines| teams| measurement

Through this paper we aim to promote a more widespread use of the repertory grid technique and to enhance rigor in its application. To do so, we build on the experience gained from three major empirical studies we conducted over the past 15 years in which we utilised multiple repertory grids to elicit key constructs. Specifically, we describe how to analyze and present grid data; how the ratings in repertory grids can be used to identify key constructs; how data coding by different researchers can lead to greater reliability; how Pareto analysis can be used to demonstrate theoretical saturation; and how conceptual models can be derived from multiple grid data.

However, empirical methods suitable for testing hypotheses about configurations of more than three conditions have only recently come to the fore. This paper examines two novel approaches to empirical analysis of organizational configurations consisting of many causal conditions: Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA), a set-theoretic approach that uses Boolean algebra to map the relationship between configurations and a performance outcome; and a lattice-theoretic approach that uses regression methods to test for complementarity relationships which lie at the heart of most configurational thinking. I discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches vis-a-vis each other and alternative empirical methods used in the study of organizational configurations. I then propose that these two methods could be used in tandem for empirical investigation of complex configurational hypotheses in data contexts where neither method would be ideal on its own. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations are used to evaluate the performance of the two methods, and of the combined approach, when these are applied to different-sized samples of data created by both continuous and set-theoretic configurational data generating processes with differing covariance structures. The simulation results suggest that both approaches perform well when applied to data generated by a number of different processes, and that the combined approach proposed in the paper is both viable and effective in a variety of data contexts.",qca| configurational hypotheses| simulation

A potential reason for adoption of this approach is a lack of awareness about the latest advances in the measures and methods of two-mode networks in the fields of physics, biology and sociology.  We present an overview of three different streams of research related to two-mode networks: a) refinements related to projections of two-mode networks to one-mode networks, b) extension of networks measures from one-mode networks to two-mode networks, with a focus on clustering coefficient, c) approaches unique to two-mode networks such as nestedness.

Although being a well-established method, qualitative interviewing is fraught with various shortcomings, such as difficulties in initiating the interview process, in eliciting tacit knowledge and in avoiding information redundancies. By providing explicitness, visual representations have been usefully employed as projective techniques to overcome the limitations inherent to verbal language and to foster knowledge elicitation. In this paper, we argue for the reflective use of visual techniques in interviewing and suggest using visuals not only as projective techniques to elicit answers, but also as facilitation techniques throughout the interview process. Our contribution is two-fold: First, we explain how the introduction of visual facilitation may improve the interview process, while also bringing advantages for the ensuing phase of data analysis. Second, we suggest a practical approach for the integration of visual projection and facilitation techniques, and we provide examples of this approach from our own research in organization and management studies.

The use of knowledge acquisition and information visualisation diagrams throughout the process enhances both the construction and the communication of a conceptual model.  Initial diagrams facilitate the gathering of vast amounts of data from narratives into a structure that supports further visualisation that facilitates comparison.  This has proven highly relevant and central to the research process and provides an integral mapping element that enhances basic case methodologies and cross case analysis.  The process exhibits robust and comprehensive results whereby the conceptual model and the maps can be used across multiple theoretical perspectives of applied research.

This study examines hospital ownership and community benefit provision beyond the traditional uncompensated care comparison by using broader measures of community benefit that capture charitable services, community assessment and partnership, and community-oriented health services. Methods: This study includes 3,317 non-government owned, general, acute care community hospitals that were in operation in 2006.  Data for this study come from the 2006 American Hospital Association Hospital Survey and the 2006 Area Resource File. We use multivariate regression analyses to examine the relationship between hospital ownership and five indicators of community benefit, controlling for hospital characteristics, market demand, hospital competition, state regulations for community benefit. Results:  NFP hospitals provide more community benefit than their FP counterparts in terms of uncompensated care, community assessment and partnership, and community-oriented health services including emergency department services.  NFP hospitals showed no difference on Medicaid inpatient load. Conclusions:  NFP hospitals report more community benefit activities relative to FP hospitals in ways that extend well beyond uncompensated care, the conventional measure of community benefit.

Lerner|U. of Colorado||",1|Sage Publications/RM Division Best Student Paper Winner||,"Failures are much more common than successes in business. And yet, reliable data on failures is seldom available for analysis, meaning that empirical studies and the supporting theories are often based exclusively on observations involving survivors.  Much of management research implicitly assumes that the missing observations substantively resemble the available observations. But, what if the missing data bears little resemblance to the available data? Under these circumstances, the conventional arsenal of parametric and semiparametric corrections may prove to be insubstantial remedies if fundamental distributional assumptions are violated by unobserved non-linear relationships. In order to demonstrate the empirical and theoretical hazards of truncation, we examine all 612 firms, 56,240 permitted projects and 12,778 licensed individuals, spanning the entire twenty-five year history of the Colorado asbestos abatement industry.  Using this natural experiment involving the creation of a new industry as a consequence of legislative action, we present empirical evidence to show that the truncation of events preceding an observation window can result in invalid empirical findings, which in turn can lead to radically different conclusions about the efficacy of the underlying theory. Truncation, which is best understood as situations in which observations on both the dependent variable and regressors are missing, is neither new, nor obscure.  It is, however, largely ignored outside the research methods community because the consequences have seemed remote.

Previously several potential approaches have been suggested for identifying careless respondents, yet almost no prior work has examined the relationships among these indicators or the types of data patterns identified by each. In two studies, we examined several methods for identifying careless responses, including (a) special items designed to detect careless response, (b) response consistency indices formed from responses to typical survey items, (c) multivariate outlier analysis, (d) response time, and (e) self-reported diligence. Results indicated that there are two distinct patterns of careless response (random and non-random) and that different indices are needed to identify these different response patterns. We also found that approximately 10-12% of undergraduates completing a lengthy survey for course credit were identified as careless responders.

Cross-sectional, survey designs are susceptible to common method variance (CMV)a threat to internal validity to which multilevel data is susceptible.  Previous research on the effects of CMV for studies finds that CMV has important, yet complex, effects on statistical results using a common multilevel analysis: mixed effects regression.  In the current study, we extend previous research on the effect of CMV on multilevel designs by discerning the mathematical structure of the bias imparted by CMV on parameter estimates in mixed effects regression analysis.  Specifically, we use probability limits to examine the statistical consistency of mixed effects regression estimates of both moderators and main effects.  Moreover, we extend our examination of mixed effects regression under conditions of CMV to include meta-analytic moderator analysis.  Through our analysis we identify how CMV affects parameter estimates and, therefore, the extent of potential bias owing to group-level CMV in mixed effects regression analysis of multilevel data.",method variance| multi-level| statistical analysis

We compare the results of the four analytic methods using two large data sets, one containing 359,722 military personnel collected over 19 years and one with 55,087 individuals from the general U.S. population collected over 38 years. Across both data sets, only cross-classified HLM fully partitioned the effects of age, period, and cohort.

One criticism of this method is that the presence of an omitted variable may lead to error (e.g., see Taylor et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 2010). The current study tested this criticism using simulation. Results suggest that, overall, the causal steps approach was generally unbiased when an omitted mediator or omitted covariate was present. However, there were certain cases in which the presence of an omitted variable did affect the accuracy and power of the causal steps approach. Results suggest that a stronger relationship between the measured mediator and the omitted variable was associated with a higher level of error. Results also indicate that situations involving an unmeasured covariate were associated with less error than were situations involving an unmeasured mediator. These findings imply that, while an omitted variable may pose a risk in some cases, the causal steps approach is generally robust against the potential effects of an omitted variable.",mediation testing| omitted variable| causal steps method

In this paper, we review these claims and assess their validity. Using a dataset from the training literature (Sitzmann et al., 2008), we illustrate the use of multiple methods to assess the influence of outliers and publication bias on meta-analytic results. We find that both outliers and publication bias can, in fact, influence meta-analytic results, which can undermine our striving towards evidence-based I/O psychology and management. Furthermore, our results suggest that outliers can influence the results from publication bias analyses.

The purpose of this paper is to provide the research design of a meta-synthesis of qualitative case studies. The aim of the meta-synthesis is to build theory out of primary qualitative case studies that have not been planned as part of a unified multi-site effect. Therefore, the meta-synthesis is a stepping-off point to the future whose product is the building of theory subsequent studies can build on. In this paper, an understanding of the synthesis of knowledge as accumulation is proposed which is congruent with the majority of post-positivistic informed case studies in the field of organizational and management research. This paper provides the research design of how to conduct a meta-synthesis of case studies and illustrates its application on the material of an ongoing meta-synthesis study. The contributions of this paper to the organizational literature are twofold. First, conceptually, this paper offers a discussion of the different understandings of the synthesis of knowledge that emerges from the three basic paradigmatic positions in organizational research. Second, methodologically, and drawing upon synthesis as the accumulation of qualitative case studies from a post-positivistic point of view, this paper provides and illustrates the research design for theory building via meta-synthesizing case studies. Therefore, this paper could serve as a conceptual and methodological resource to scholars wishing to synthesize qualitative case studies in the field of organizational and management research.",meta-synthesis| case study research| synthesis of knowledge

We use the review to organize qualitative studies in strategy into ten design types. This enables us to develop an empirically grounded framework capturing designs-in-use that correspond to the actual research practice of strategy scholars, rather than ideal types that ignore the tendency of scholars to amalgamate designs in an eclectic fashion. Our framework captures the plurality of qualitative strategy research, which is a source of generative capacity and enables it to make unique, rich theoretical contributions.

Reviewing the IS literature based on the suggested definition, we identify four dominant views of unlearning, which are: individual forgetting, questioning and criticizing, stopping the application, and discarding. In order to expand and empirically ground the insights of the previous studies, we explore how organizations apply unlearning in the case of disruptive IT changes, through a multiple case study approach. The insight from the empirical study shows that organizations adopt a wide range of unlearning practices, in addition to practices that can be captured under the four views of unlearning in the IS literature. Moreover, our empirical investigation reveals six characteristics of the IS context which have direct bearings on applying unlearning practices. Synthesizing the results of the empirical study with the insights in the IS literature, we show how the conception of unlearning can be completed, specified, and contextualized in order to inform future studies in this area.",obsolete knowledge| unlearning| is management

We suggest that participants prefer to transfer knowledge to others with whom they share common ground and use joint characteristics with their communicating partners to assess the level of common ground.  In particular, we propose that both surface-level (location and status) and deep-level (expertise) similarities of a dyad drive knowledge transfer.  Further we propose that a knowledge providers cumulative knowledge-sharing experience in an online forum moderates the relative effects of surface-level and deep-level similarities on knowledge transfer.  Using panel data at an online knowledge forum of a large IT consulting firm, we find that similarity breeds connection in online forums.  Additionally, we find that the effect of deep-level similarity on knowledge transfer increases whereas the effect of surface-level similarity decreases with knowledge providers experience.  That is, as participants gain experience, they provide knowledge less frequently to others at the same location and in the same status and more frequently to others with similar expertise.",online community| knowledge| common ground

We find that employees who were once marginal to the formal innovation process (representing remote unused knowledge silos of the firm) may perform equally well or better than employees who had traditionally been central to the innovation process (representing local incumbent knowledge silos of the firm). The firm benefits by virtue of unveiling and bridging across such knowledge silos through a crowdsourcing platform.  Specifically, our investigation shows that employees who were once distant due to hierarchical position or geographical location from the traditional innovation process, are effective innovators indeed, irrespective of career related expectations.

The main sources of data were:  in-depth interviews with seventeen managers, a focus group comprised of seven employees, documentary analysis and informal discussions with human resources professionals.  The study was designed to examine how managers accustomed to managing during times of high growth learned to take action during turbulent organizational change.   One key finding from the study was that all managers described coaching as a key component of their managerial role.  Moreover, managers indicated that the disorienting experience of unprecedented downsizing triggered managerial learning that informed ways of coaching employees through significant organizational change.   Finally, an emergent finding suggested that managers needed to make sense of organizational events in a workplace context strongly influenced by electronic media as they moved to action.

However, the genetic algorithma computational model that has been used to solve optimization problems in fields as diverse as biology, engineering, and economics, has been remarkably successful in finding high-performance solutions in part by selecting agents based on their performance, or sampling on the dependent variable. We conducted a text analysis of one change method associated with positive search and commonly used in organizations today--to show that the genetic algorithm can be used as an appropriate model of appreciative inquiry. This suggests that, under the right conditions, sampling on the dependent variable could be a viable, and even highly successful, form of organizational search.

Testing for indirect mediation, we show, with a bootstrapped sample of 155 employees (tracked across 12 months from The Netherlands, Sweden, and the UK), that the provision of voice opportunities during the acquisition has a positive long-term impact on all employee adjustment indices; importantly the analysis indicates that this avoice effecta on survivor adjustment occurs through the impact that voice provision has on perceptions of procedural justice immediately following the acquisition. In addition, we find that managerial communication (information sharing) immediately following the acquisition has a direct and positive long-term influence on levels of survivor job satisfaction and that this relationship operates outside the influence of procedural justice judgments.",adjustment to change| merger and acquisitions| communication

They argued that a degree of ambiguity, contradiction and incoherence provided the catalyst for organizational learning, diversity and renewal, and advocated minimalism in all forms of organizing to ensure a dynamic balance between creative responsiveness and disciplined efficiency. By the 1980s, the recognition that organizational dualities such as continuity and change, freedom and accountability, efficiency and creativity, were not for resolution or reconciliation had garnered a robust and appreciative membership. Embracing duality thinking was seen as critical to understanding organizational dynamics because the tension stimulated novelty. Duality thinking also gained significant traction as traditional forms of organizing came unstuck in the face of global economic crises, and increasing ecological and environmental uncertainty. Consequently, the need for sustainable, dynamic solutions to ensure long-term competitive and collaborative success impelled the new modus operandi. This paper exposes the emergence of duality theory in organizations and conceptualizes its characteristics through five duality dimensions. These dimensions outline the role of improvisation as the catalysing medium for dynamism, minimalism, simultaneity and relatedness. With a dualities-aware set of guidelines in place, we examine the options for converting concept into practice.

Depending on how the forces of continuity and change co-evolve has consequences for an organizations likelihood of achieving the transformation. Based on an in-depth qualitative study of change in three case firms, we make three observations. First, when competing values for continuity and change surface and are strongly expressed, in response to change initiatives, the stronger the forces of tension and momentum and the greater the likelihood of achieving the intended transformation. Second, the way the interplay of tension and momentum is managed influences whether continuity and change evolve as synthesizing, polarizing or drifting forces affecting, in turn, the likelihood of achieving the transformation. Third, oscillations and reversals in a process of continuity and change accelerate the process of transformation. These characteristics together increase the likelihood of transformation. The paper draws out practical implications by illuminating how managers can proactively manage the process to enhance the likelihood of achieving the transformation.",continuity and change| change processes| radical transformation

Chisholm Best Theory-to-Practice Paper||,"Whilst bureaucracy has for much of the last century been the dominant structural configuration within the public sector throughout the western world, the past two decades have seen increasing pressure for change.  The cumulative effect of these pressures has created a need for public sector organisations to change their organisational policies, cultural values, work procedures and processes, relationships between departments, and interactions with both service users and suppliers. In consequence, organisations which have been characterised by rigid hierarchical structures and narrowly defined and highly specialised jobs are facing pressure to adapt to new forms of organisation. Thus change management has become an increasingly important issue within the arena of public sector management. This paper examines the form which one programme of change took in the case of a large UK public sector revenue collection agency. The findings showed that the organisation adapted a linear rational approach to change management, but that this approach was ultimately unsuccessful in delivering anything beyond behaviour compliance amongst operational level employees. The case highlights the need for public sector managers to take account of hierarchical and cross functional differences in values, perceptions and interpretations when planning and implementing change.  Such factors are all closely associated with the systemic multivariate approach to managing change, which is recommended as being particularly apposite for delivering effective change in the public sector.",public sector| change management

Each of these linear and formulaic models place change leaders at the center of the action. The assumption is that if change leaders follow the simple prescribed steps, the change will be successful. This paper presents the Human Reaction System, a change recipient-centric organizational change model: it places the organizational actors responsible for carrying out the change at the center of the action. The model does not emphasize controlling change, but understanding change. Its goal is to fully explain reaction to change and to identify and explain the stimuli that generate response, not to provide an easy-to-use, marketable how to method for leading change. The model is open, holistic, and diverse. Concisely, the model begins to answer the question: What are the different mechanisms and antecedents that compel change recipients to respond in the way that they do when experiencing an organizational change? To answer this question, various theories, both seminal and contemporary across several disciplines were tapped.",organizational change| resistance| leading change

However, corporate boards vary in noticing and attributing the cause of decline which leads to variation in the speed and timeliness of CEO dismissal. Studies of organizational decline and organizational change suggest that adjustments, such as replacing the CEO, may not occur in a timely manner. Drawing from Fords (1987) interpretation based perspective on organizational adaptation to performance downturns I empirically examine how attributions of causality of different types of performance downturns affect the corporate boards interpretations of CEO skill and their speed of response action. Based on a sample of 376 CEO dismissal observations in 348 public US firms during the period 1992-2009, I find that there is systematic variation in speed of CEO dismissal responses depending on the type of performance downturn. The results have implications for understanding how boards of directors attribute causality of the downturn externally to environmental factors or internally to the CEO.",ceo dismissal| speed of response| attribution

However, formulating and implementing strategic renewal is a complex task because it includes refreshment and replacement of attributes of an organization. Understanding the hurdles of renewal and trying to find responses to the emerging conflict it generates is an important step forward for strategy and organization studies. To disentangle the ability of senior managers to run a process of renewal, our study poses two questions: What hurdles does an ongoing concern encounter when formulating and executing a discontinuous strategic renewal? And what action is taken to overcome them? To answer these questions, we provide an in-depth longitudinal evidence of Ducati Motor Holding -- a company that, under the tenure of a newly- appointed CEO, started a turnaround in 1996 and completed its process of strategic renewal in 2007. Our findings highlight how the creation of a new competence that drew an analogy between motorbikes and the entertainment business (vs. the mechanical business of motorbikes) enabled Ducati to overcome, in the short run, the critical financial situation that had almost brought it on the verge of bankruptcy. At the same time, it set in motion a series of contradictions that jeopardized the overall renewal process. We note that such contradictions do not only have a technical and rational nature, but also a normative nature. Overcoming these contradictions implies starting up a process of reconfiguration based on integrating the newly emerged capabilities with the original competence base. Reconfiguration acts as a catalyst for both technical and normative forces that are generated within the organization and within its surrounding environment. Solving contradictions during the process of strategic renewal means finding a synthesis of the organizational work. Our contribution is a process model o strategic renewal through which firms can formulate and execute discontinuous change.",strategic renewal| dynamic capabilities| exploration

Previous research revealed that greater agility and resiliency are critical dimensions of adaptive capacity and are strongly associated with higher performance in terms of competitiveness and profitability. High agility and high resiliency (what we term High AR) are strongly correlated; developing one without the other can lead to damaging consequences or organizational failure. We identify five specific capabilities associated with High AR  Purposefulness, Awareness, Action Orientation, Resourcefulness, and Networked. We explore the role of each capability in promoting High AR at four intervention levels  individual, team, organization and ecosystem. Our position is that organizations can never master turbulence and sustain high performance if development interventions are not balanced across all four levels. We identify responsibilities in the intervention process for different C-suite roles.",agility| resilience| turbulence

We develop a system dynamics model of process improvement when the same people must do both production and process improvement. The model incorporates learning so that the productivity of doing improvement activities grows as workers accumulate experience. The model enables a rigorous examination into how the feedback structure of process improvement presents challenges to people in a system facing the dual pressure to produce output and to build capability.  Simulation analysis highlights the tradeoff between production and improvement and demonstrates a tipping point that demarcates enduring high production levels.  Results show that policy orientations that favor learning lead to superior performance.,process improvement| tipping point| system dynamics

We propose energy mobilization and energy maintenance as two processes by which strategic leaders influence POE and, subsequently, organizational performance.",productive organizational energy| organizational performance| strategic transformational leadership

The current literature on trust and behavior controls in virtual teams has several important gaps: 1) Past studies have included only one type of trust and one type of behavior control. 2) The literature has exclusively focused on how behavior controls facilitate or inhibit the development of trust in virtual teams). 3) The current literature has yet to establish a causal link between the relationship of trust and behavior controls and the performance of virtual teams. 4) There is a lack of theoretical clarity about the influence of behavior controls on the impact of trust. To address this gap in the literature this paper examines: 1) Two type of trust (affective and cognitive) and two types of behavior controls (internal and external). 2) How behavior controls alters the influence of trust on the performance of virtual teams. 3) Proposals and empirically test a theoretical model that helps to reconcile the views of trust and behavior.

The healthcare sector is one such area which has used ICTs to measure and collect a plethora of performance indicators.  However, despite the increasing importance of ICTs for visibility and control across numerous sectors over the last decade, there has been little theoretical development in the IS literature.  In this paper, we develop a sociomaterial perspective which highlights the entanglement of ICTs and visibility in the managing of performances in healthcare settings.  Our theoretical approach builds on Pinchs (2008, 2010) explicit recognition of materiality in Goffmans (1959) social interaction theory to explore the development of multidisciplinary work in a healthcare setting.   Drawing on Goffmans metaphor of staging and the stage, our findings demonstrate how apparent social performances such as status and reputation are entangled with materiality facilitating the dramatic realization of professionals performance in multidisciplinary teams.  Our study provides insight into ICT-mediated visibility whereby the few (more powerful) become visible to the many (less powerful) through sociomaterial assemblages at a number of levels (policy, intra- and inter-hospital), with consequences for associated relations of control.

The literature on IT-based control still raises some problems, such as the conflation of control with the concepts of power, coordination and surveillance. Moreover, another problem in the literature on IT-based control in organizations is linked to the overused metaphor of the Foucauldian panopticon to represent the control potential of modern IT in work settings. Indeed, the direct translation of the panopticon into studies of surveillance technologies has led to a mono-lithic and sometimes exaggerated vision of IT-based control. That is why our goal in this paper is to go beyond this reductionist and rather simplistic view of IT-based control to address other forms of control, which rely on various mechanisms and dimensions and allow grasping control as a situated and emergent process.",control| surveillance| power

First, it is stated that ES success is relative, and five different perspectives on success are distinguished: Management success, Project success, System success, Correspondence success and User success. From each of these perspectives, the success of an ES implementation is likely to be judged quite differently, and the relevance of perspectives also differs across time. Building on a sociomateriality perspective, the increasing flexibility of ES (due to the rise of Service Oriented Architectures, Business Process Management and Software as a Service) is related to these perspectives. Propositions are developed stating that flexibility will positively affect success from the perspective of users (user success) and business process owners (correspondence success), whereas from an IT management perspective (system success) positive effects are likely but conditional on how systems maintenance is organized. From a top management perspective (management success), both positive (increased agility) and negative (decreased integration) effects are expected, and from a project management perspective (project success), negative effects are likely and can be countered by changing IT and implementation governance, methods and metrics to accommodate the increasing complexity of systems implementation and maintenance.",enterprise systems| flexibility| sociomateriality

More specifically we propose that: 1. There is a positive association between accrued sources of managerial power of sITes, such as structural and expert power, and a firm's ability to develop superior IT capability.  2. Firms that achieve such superiority are more likely to signal their appreciation and reward (promote) their sITes. 3. If sITes value this reward, they are more likely to stay longer with their firm, thus ensuring the continuity of an already successful IT leadership and a firms ability to sustain its IT superiority. Results based on panel data of 1326 large US firms from a wide spectrum of industries over a 13-year period (1997-2009) support our propositions. Empirical evidence validates our position that firms that want to achieve and sustain IT superiority need to create an organizational climate of positive reciprocity.

The study uses a micro-economic model in order to show that higher forecasting accuracy is likely to provide opportunity for knowledge workers to behave in a morally hazardous fashion. The result of this opportunistic behavior is that knowledge workers can appropriate for themselves a relatively larger portion of the firms rents from BI investments that should accrue to firm and ultimately to external stakeholders. Studies that measure the payoffs from IT investments that enable more accurate forecasts, such as BI, are likely to underestimate the total benefits by the portion that knowledge workers will appropriate for themselves through their opportunistic behavior.",uncertainty| fraud opportunity| knowledge workers

In this study, we compare the RA and its associated interrogation feature against three alternative online recommendation sources (i.e. store, consumers, and experts) that do not require the initial interrogation process necessary for RAs.  We draw upon the Elaboration-Likelihood Model (ELM) to compare the differences among the sources as well as the content (i.e. high vs. low quality products). Using an online experimental study with 124 subjects, we found that 1) the RA was not perceived to be more credible and informative than experts, thus an experts recommendation is suggested as an alternative to an RA; 2) recommendations from RAs and experts, but not consumers, were found to be superior to the stores recommendation in terms of perceived source credibility and perceived product informativeness; 3) regardless of the source, recommendations with high-quality content were perceived to be significantly more credible and informative than those with low-quality content.

To do this we look at multi-homing users participation on multiple independent and competing exchanges. We use a unique dataset of 118 multi-homing buyers participations in two exchanges to examine how activity levels on the exchanges affect their preferences. We find that buyers preferences are positively associated with selling activity levels on the exchanges. Higher selling activity level on an exchange provides greater benefits to buyers, and motivates them to participate more on it than on the competing exchange. We also find that buyers preferences are non-monotonically related to buying activity levels on the exchange. At low levels, an increase in buying activity has a positive effect on buyers preference. This effect may derive from the principle of social proof, where individual buyers observe and imitate other similar buyers behaviors. As buying activity level increases, however, there is greater competition among buyers on the exchange. This increase in competition may cause buyers to participate more on the other exchange. Our results show that both market factors and social information conveyed by users on the exchanges affects competition between exchanges.",electronic markets| network externalities| social influences

We test the respective role of each of these three complementary pricing strategies with archival data from a global online market that specializes in the outsourcing of IT services. The results confirm that, besides cost-based pricing, service providers also account for the information signals of competing providers when pricing their services, while they also personalize their prices for service outsourcers with different quality levels to shield themselves from transaction uncertainty.",strategic bidding| personalized pricing| outsourcing

Rooted in the reference group theory and utilizing a comprehensive archival dataset, this paper empirically investigates how 255 Chinese cities are influenced by their multiple reference groups in developing their electronic government practice. Results suggest that, in developing its electronic government website, a municipal government is significantly influenced by its provincial peers, and such influence is significantly stronger for politically central cities such as capitals. As a contrast, only cities with large population and thus enjoying high benefit potentials from electronic government practice appear to search for reference points nationally based on comparability. There  is also evidence that local search for reference points within a province and global search for reference points nation-wide are substituting each other, probably due to resource and capacity constraints of a city. Jointly, the findings reveal that reference groups identified on different bases have different influences on the focal municipal government during the development and diffusion of electronic government practice in China.",reference group theory| innovation diffusion| electronic government

First, we find that pre alliance knowledge stocks of the partners as also as the knowledge commonality between the partners facilitates knowledge flows to the focal firm. Moreover, we find that these knowledge flows are enhanced when the focal firm has high Information Technology capabilities. We find support to the argument that IT is a necessary complementary resource that facilitates knowledge flows among partners in alliances.",alliance| it investments| knowledge transfer

When confronted with novel and uncertain tasks, team members have to evaluate others expertise and knowledge contributions and integrate disparate knowledge.  On one hand, they can emphasize knowledge validation, elaboration, and explicitly confront the differences found across knowledge boundaries  an approach referred to as knowledge traversal.  On the other hand, they can trust each others domain expertise, avoid knowledge conflict, and co-create a common framework based on a meshing of individual contributions  an approach referred to as knowledge transcendence.  However, little is known about why team members engage in either practice, what situations trigger them, and when it is necessary to accept or confront the knowledge of the other team members during complex collaboration. This research identifies how these knowledge workers assess when they need to engage in deep dialogue (i.e., knowledge traversal) and when they accept each others knowledge contribution (i.e., knowledge transcendence). Based on in depth interviews with 27 knowledge workers involved in complex tasks in multidisciplinary settings, we offer a practice-based view how knowledge integration is achieved.",complex collaboration| knowledge integration| multidisciplinary teams

This article presents the results of a longitudinal case study of an effective innovation project where an inter-organizational self-managed R&D team worked on a software platform in the field of pervasive positioning. Using grounded theory techniques the analysis shows that effective innovation can be characterized by five interrelated practices: interpreting, assessing, strategizing, expanding, and tolerating. These practices constitute the basic elements of a trading zone where team members can collaborate despite their different objectives, interests, and work practices. The trading zone throws new light on the contradictory results previously obtained, by highlighting a negotiation process where different team configurations can lead to a fruitful collaboration and knowledge exchange.

Trait anger was positively related to escalation tendencies (i.e. higher trait anger, greater tendency to stick to a losing course of action), a finding that held when anger was assessed alone (Study 1), and when controlling for the influence of negative affect or the influence of trait anxiety (Study 2).  More importantly, the trait anger - escalation relationship held not only when anger and escalation tendencies were assessed concurrently (Study 1), but also when they were assessed five weeks apart (Study 2).

In particular, we provide much needed data of concurrent monitoring of psycho-physiological indices of emotion while participants make decisions in the moral dilemma situations. In Study 1, we found that individuals who engage in suppression more frequently were more likely to make utilitarian choices in the moral dilemma situation, while those who engage in reappraisal more frequently were less likely to make utilitarian choice.  In Study 2, not only did participants make more utilitarian decisions when they were told to suppress emotional reactions they experienced, but also their utilitarian preferences carried over to increase perceptions of moral clarity concerning unrelated moral decisions. More specifically, this relationship between suppression and utilitarian choice was more pronounced among those who have low physiological reactivity.

One theoretical implication is that power increases attention to any goal-relevant information (regardless of whether it would facilitate versus constrain goal achievement). We conducted five experiments to test how power affects attention to goal-facilitating versus goal-constraining information. We consistently found that facilitating information does not loom larger in the minds of the powerful, but rather constraints shrink. The powerful defied authority to act of their own accord, spent fewer resources to armor themselves against potential constraints, sought out less constraint-related information, recalled less constraint-related information, and conceived of fewer constraints as they scripted out the future than the powerless. Across the present, past, and future, the powerful were more likely to disregard goal-constraining information than those lacking power. This research demonstrates how power restricts cognition and thereby biases decisions. This carries important implications for those in positions of power and offers a unique cognitive explanation as to why power so often leads to action a the powerful are simply less aware of action-inhibiting constraints.",power| goals| cognition

Extraverts are systematically predisposed to positive affect, which influences what kind of knowledge about followers is most accessible, which in turn influences what style of leadership they will employ.

Theoretical models (e.g. Billings et al. 1980; Cowan 1986) represent crises recognition as a function of cumulated cue discrepancy. The paper analyzes the response of 9-1-1 emergency system at the time of the attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001; the data set consists of 356 phone calls to the 9-1-1 emergency number, registered during the 102 minutes encompassed between the first attack to the WTC and the second collapse of the Towers. Conversation analysis is developed to study the case. This analysis of the first response as a case of problem detection offers an original approach to consider the 9/11 disaster. In addition, data analysis displays that the existing theoretical models, based on cumulated cue discrepancies, fail to capture some fundamental dynamics that characterize the detection of a novel form of emergency. First, emergency units become progressively aware that they are experiencing a novel situation. Second, rapidly evolving situations and a distributed structure of information processing make it harder to distinguish relevant novel information from background noise, and this difficulty affects the possibility to detect new types of disasters. Finally, the paper discusses what emergency organizations can do to prepare themselves to cope with unexpected and novel crises.",emergency management| problem detection| preparedness

The literature is silent about how financial advisors beliefs and behaviors have been affected by the 2008 crisis and how it has impacted the advice they render clients. Phenomenological semi-structured interviews with 30 US financial advisors generated insights about how and to what extent they learn from and adapt to market disruptions. Despite evidence that such events trigger learning, our results show overwhelming financial advisor reliance on static allocation strategies, enduring beliefs in recurring market patterns and a propensity to stretch time horizons to rationalize behavior. Striking differences in cognitive capacity and perceived locus of control distinguish the post-2008 practice of most financial advisors from the relatively few who have adopted more dynamic portfolio management approaches.",decision making| disruptive events| learning

Based on our inductive study of the Irish banking crisis that used interviews and archival data, we develop a stage-based model of organizational decline. In the initial stages (2004-2005), warning signals were missed since the environment was relatively munificent and intense rivalry in the industry had promoted a sales culture. In the middle stages (2006  mid-2007), warning signals started being noticed but were disregarded due to the interplay of a slowly declining environmental munificence and shared belief in the efficacy of aggressive banking. In the latter stages (mid-2007  mid-2008), warning signals were acknowledged as urgent but not translated for action since banks under-estimated their magnitude and expected a soft landing. These findings are interesting and important for three reasons. First, they question a key tenet of the strategic issue identification (SID) literature, namely that threats are prioritized over opportunities. Second, they elaborate how cross-level linkages and context limit decision-making, an area identified as a central challenge in both the Neo-Carnegie perspective and the SID literature.

It is expected that diverse information and expertise will be shared among group members and such information sharing would lead to better decision making by groups. Stasser and Titus (1985) found that groups focus on common information during discussion and neglect unique information. Further, research found that inability to share unique information during discussion does not allow groups to take optimal decisions (Stasser and Stewart, 1992). Sharing of common information leads to mutual enhancement among group members (Wittenbaum, Hubbell, & Zuckerman, 1999). Research has found that subjects are more willing to share information in dyadic settings compared to larger groups (Taylor, de Soto, & Lieb, 1979). Most researchers have often either focused on studying behavior of the groups or on studying behavior of dyads (Moreland, 2010). This research tested the probability of unique information sharing being enhanced by structuring group discussion such that there is prework (preparation towards final task) among group members in dyads which leads to mutual enhancement at group level for the dyad members.A cross-sectional between-subjects experimental design was used for the study. Data was collected from first year students of post-graduate program in 6 different institutes. 21 groups were conducted with the help of 126 participants.

Managerial Learning and the Acquisition Capability of Firms,1|Philipp Meyer-Doyle|U. of Pennsylvania||,,"Using micro-data on executives involved in acquisitions, this paper examines how executives prior acquisition experience shapes the firms future acquisition performance over time. I find that managers acquisition experience positively impacts a firms subsequent acquisition performance. This effect is largely driven by managers firm-specific acquisition experience; however managers outside experience can become more valuable to the new firm, the more knowledge the manager has about the new firm based on longer tenure. Further, I find that executive turnover lowers acquisition performance in the short-term, due to the disruption to team-dependent learned knowledge and routines. I also examine which executive function learns most in acquisitions and where learning in acquisitions manifests itself, including in the selection, execution and implementation aspects. Overall, this paper refines our knowledge of how and at what levels firms learn in corporate development and thus gives important insights into the black box of learning in strategy. It also highlights the important, yet thus far overlooked, role that micro-foundational factors play in shaping a firms corporate development capability.",learning| acquisitions| micro-foundations

A buy-side investigation of the dual tracking phenomenon in M&A,"1|Roberto Ragozzino|U. of Texas, Dallas||",,"We seek to identify the key characteristics that allow some firms to acquire valuable entrepreneurial resources in lieu of other potential buyers. This question is central to how firms are able to create and sustain a competitive advantage. The backdrop of this study is the phenomenon of dual tracking, which consists of the acquisition of entrepreneurial firms shortly after they undergo an initial public offering. The results reveal that acquirers that are geographically proximate and that have prior ties with the target are more likely to engage in dual tracking than others. Moreover, industry similarities and prior specific experience with the acquisition of newly-public firms are also predictors of dual tracking. These results withstand several robustness checks.",m&a| dual tracking| ipo

Drawing on insights from information economics, we propose that firms seek flexible ownership arrangements by way of lower equity position, and make a premium payment when faced with a high level of information asymmetry.  Further, stock-based payment method creates a bonding arrangement, minimizing the problems of adverse selection and moral hazard in high asymmetric information environments.  There is, however, a significant cost of such bonding arrangements.  The premium that firms pay in high asymmetric environment is significantly higher if firms use stock payments as compared to cash.Paper is No Longer Available Online: Please contact the author(s).This study contributes to the literature on practice diffusion by theoretically and empirically situating the diffusion process in a bubble context.

However, the full implications of spinoffs may be particularly difficult for analysts to forecast, potentially offsetting the benefits of their favorable informational positions.  The research in this paper establishes that the costs associated with the complexity of evaluating equity spinoffs exceeds the benefits of analysts' information provision capabilities in this context. In addition to elucidating a heretofore-unidentified tension between analysts' information-provision capabilities and contextual complexity, this study provides unique insights into how analysts understand and describe the corporate strategies companies undertake and establishes that the transactions used to contract firms' scopes may make it more difficult for analysts to accurately assess those companies.",spinoffs| corporate strategy| analysts

Informal relations stop providing easy access to parents resources since the relationships between the progeny and the parent mature, and non-spinoffs can overcome their disadvantage by other means, like hiring parents retirees. Cross-case analyses show that, as the volume of transaction with parent increases, non-spinoffs start acting like spinoffs (moderating effect of greater dependencies on parent as single/major customer).",case study; spinoffs; transfer of routines| organizational learning| informal relations and social capital

The paper contributes to the strategy literature in two ways. First, most of the previous theoretical and empirical work posits that vertical integration is the organizational form that offers more ability to adapt to unforeseen contingencies. This paper presents evidence that when a low demand state is realized, vertical integration confronts short-term performance disadvantages due to its relative rigidity to reduce variable production costs (i.e. material and labor inputs). Second, previous research in strategy has not made an explicit connection between performance implications of vertical integration and those of industrial agglomeration. This work presents evidence that the relative performance disadvantage of vertical integration in this context increases in the level of industrial agglomeration due to its relative inability to benefit from the location-specific externalities.",industrial agglomeration| vertical integration| adaptation

Quelin|HEC Paris||3|Walmir Maia|UFBA - Federal U. of Bahia||,,"This paper discusses the different reasons that drive organizations to interrupt outsourcing, reverse their previous decision and then reintegrate activities formerly delegated to providers. Contractual approaches, mainly derived from Transaction Costs Economics, offer some plausible explanations for reintegration originating from outsourcing failure. These explanations are mainly related to asset specificity, poor contractual design, and deficient monitoring. We show that companies may also reintegrate in response to changes in their strategic intents and in response to shifts in the institutional environment. The study of a real case of outsourcing interruption in industrial maintenance illustrates these factors. However, some other determinants complement the contractual and strategic background. Namely, bandwagon behavior and isomorphic pressures exerted by external actors may also explain why some organizations reverse outsourcing decisions and reintegrate activities. In order to address the reintegration phenomenon, we propose an integrative framework that combines micro and macro levels of organizational analysis. We argue that some existing complementarities between the different theories we use here can shed some light on real organizational problems. In other words, we claim that theoretical frameworks in isolation are not enough to explain reintegration. Besides the implications for theory, our work can help managers to understand the dynamics of organizational boundaries, thus allowing them to make better choices in both outsourcing and reintegration decisions.",reintegration| outsourcing failure| isomorphism

The results indicate that greater foreign competition reduces product diversification but fosters international diversification, while macro-economic growth has a positive impact on product diversification and a negative one on international diversification.

In a large panel of U.S. insurance companies, our study empirically validates the theoretical conflict between the two logics as we find support for a strong negative interaction between them.

First, we borrow from the resource-based view of diversification to explain why the improvement in the quality of strategic assets is higher for related diversifiers when compared to the non-diversifying firms. Second, we combine the resource-based view of diversification with the market power advantage logic to explain why the ability of the diversifying firms (sellers of good A) to leverage their market power in their home market to gain advantage in the target market (for complementary good B) will not only vary across the diversifying firms but also their respective [related] target markets. Third, we develop additional hypotheses to control for alternate explanations for the variation in effectiveness of the choice to diversify on the demand-side across the diversifying firms in their target markets.

Apart from TCE and the closely related modern property rights theory, no other theory has been able to explain asset ownership by firms. This paper offers a theory of centralized asset ownership that does not use opportunism as a factor affecting integration decisions. The present paper uses prospect theory and risk aversion to argue that integration of assets may be optimal for exchanges that could impact the value of the assets even when there is no opportunism. This theory complements the findings of TCE and helps build a more complete picture of why firms exist.",risk aversion| theory of the firm| transaction-cost economics

Their presence in a wide variety of institutional contexts, their long histories, and their persistence in emerging economies despite widespread institutional changes suggest an ability to cope with and adapt to institutional change. In this study, taking advantage of large scale pro-market reforms in India, we seek to answer the question that has puzzled scholars: why do business groups persist? We argue that the structure of business groups, particularly the presence of a common dominant owner, helps them cope with change. Freed of the problems risk aversion and myopia that typically accompany separation of ownership and control, firms affiliated to business groups are able to exploit the wide range of opportunities that pro-market reforms inevitably provide. Further, we suggest that by providing affiliate firms with access to a diverse range of resources due to their ownership in a variety of firms, active core owners expand the scope of available opportunities to them. Finally, we claim that the improved corporate governance norms in emerging economies, a consequence of institutional reforms, enhance the value adding potential of active core owners.

We argue that this situation is partly due to the institutional conditions in emerging economies. Previous research has pointed out that the institutional structure of emerging economies leads to higher costs for arm-length exchanges provides less support for market transactions leading to higher incidence of market failure. Much less attention has been paid to the institutional structure inside of firms. Applying the logic of the Coase Theorem, we argue that poorly-specified organizational property rights make for a series of firm inefficiencies that are collectively defined as internal market failures. Both external and internal market failures, in turn, make it difficult for EE firms to compete in global markets; particularly it is difficult to obtain resource based competitive advantages in high value-added, knowledge-based activities and industries. After reviewing and synthesizing research on the relationship between institutional environment and EE firm failures, we discuss the implications for management research and practice, and then provides several possible extensions for further research.",emerging economies| institutional environment| resource-based view

A Study on New Product Introductions in the Japanese Soft-drink Industry,"1|Shigeru Asaba|Gakushuin U.||2|Marvin B Lieberman|U. of California, Los Angeles||",,"Imitation is a ubiquitous but complex phenomenon in the business world. Imitation has been examined in many theoretical studies that point to types of firms that are likely to be followed, and corresponding patterns of behavior have been empirically validated. A standard finding is that large or successful firms are imitated to economize on information costs.  Other studies suggest that firms regard others of similar size as direct rivals and imitate them to mitigate rivalry and risk.  While most studies have stressed the role of organization size in influencing imitation, other traits may also be influential. Researchers have typically taken the viewpoint of followers without considering how leaders strategies affect imitation.  This study explores these issues by examining what kinds of firms were followed in their new product introductions in the Japanese soft-drink industry. We find that patterns of imitation are highly dependent on context. Under high uncertainty, informative firms tend to be followed, whereas under low uncertainty, similar firms tend to be followed.  Firms appear informative based not only on large size but also on certain industry origins reflecting their expertise.  Moreover, the industrys dominant firm and a large but highly differentiated firm are not followed.  The former has strategic incentives to act as a follower  and hence its behavior fails to provide an early signal to others - whereas the latter is too idiosyncratic to be informative or imitable. Thus we find that strategy and degree of uncertainty are important contingencies that affect the imitation pattern.",imitation| information cascade| competitive interaction

In this paper, we argue that firm performance depends not only on the characteristics of each competitive move but also on the time-paced pattern in which they are made, especially in technology-based industries.  Using sequence analysis on an experiential simulation dataset, we find that firms carry out time-paced competitive sequences that adhere to three archetypal patterns and identify which patterns are most performance-enhancing. Our findings show that firms whose sequences follow regular (i.e. continuous or periodic) patterns and whose sequences do not conform to their competitors perform well. The performance effects of these archetypal sequences are particularly significant for internal R&D moves and in new markets. These findings contribute to the literature on competitive sequences by integrating time-paced sequences and conformity with rivals, and to the literature on organizational learning by incorporating competition and its effects on performance.",competitive moves| sequences| innovation

Information-based imitation theory suggests that in highly uncertain environments firms may actively look for and imitate the strategy of the leader because they perceive it to possess more market knowledge. By borrowing from competitive dynamics and information-based imitation research we argue that the firms decision to imitate or differentiate from the market leader is a function of both environmental uncertainty and market leader visibility. The results show that when environmental uncertainty is high the relationship between the market leader visibility and the firms level of imitation of the market leader is positive, while when environmental uncertainty is low the relationship is negative, meaning that in low uncertainty environments firms increasingly differentiate from the leader as it becomes more visible.

On the contrary, the competitive interactions between rivals trigger a Red Queen effect of accelerated competition in the multimarket, which has provoked debates among researchers. The resource perspective of the alliance network has always been an important issue in strategic management. Based on competitive dynamics research, the present study explores the influence of resource similarity and multimarket contact on cross-border competitive aggressiveness of multinational corporations (MNCs) highly engaged in coopetition. Furthermore, we examine the mediating effect of competitive aggressiveness and study multimarket competition from the viewpoint of coopetition network. We then use the awareness-motivation-capability perspective to develop the hypothesis. By examining competitive interactions of the top 21 global shipping companies from 2007 to 2010, we found that (1) resource similarity negatively affects cross-border competitive aggressiveness; (2) multimarket contact positively affects cross-border competitive aggressiveness; and (3) cross-border competitive aggressiveness significantly affects operating performance. Accordingly, cross-border competitive aggressiveness mediates organizational performance, resource similarity, and multimarket contact. The findings not only fulfill the gap in the literature of competitive dynamics in competition network, but also show the direction to the enterprises in practicing new coopetition strategy.Keywords: competitive aggressiveness, coopetition, competitive dynamics, multinational corporations, resource similarity, multimarket contact",competitive dynamics| multinational corporations| competitive aggressiveness

We show that the presence of superior firms (kingpins) in a segment increases the segments share of total sector value, and establishes the segment as a bottleneck. Although kingpins exert a positive externality on their direct competitors, a bottleneck segment displays more internal inequality, making the presence of kingpins a double-edged sword.",value migration| industry architecture| capabilities

Faced with the private cost of administering sanctions, actors may choose to ignore norm violations and norms may thereby lose their power. Community support for sanctioning can offset this tendency, but such support requires that the community assess the legitimacy of observed sanctions. In this paper, we use both qualitative evidence and a quantitative scenario-based experiment to explore how chefs in Italian gourmet cuisine decide when to sanction violations of norms governing the use of transferred know-how. We find that actors fear that sanctioning actions will be interpreted, ironically, as themselves an illegitimate defection from the norm. Our results show that actors are more likely to sanction violators when the visibility of the initial violation or the reputation level of the violator makes them think that the community will interpret a sanction as legitimate.",mixed method| social norms| knowledge transfer

It finds that in order to access local knowledge and thereby benefit from clustering, firms must be active participants in the local research community. In addition, it is found that firms benefit less from collocation in regions where inventions are concentrated in one or a few firms. Specifically, co-authorships on scientific articles with local organizations increase both the rate and novelty of firms patents, but this effect disappears in clusters with high degrees of inventive concentration.",agglomeration| innovation| knowledge transfer

This paper argues that market signals can usefully guide the former but may be unhelpful for the latter, which can often require resource deployments that are not justifiable on efficiency grounds.  Although there is broad consensus among theorists that markets fail and that firms routinely fall short of maximizing profits, these observations are typically construed as institutional shortcomings that economists and managers should strive to overcome.  In contrast, we argue that in order to make possible or valuable what otherwise would not be, managers need at times to defy market induced pressures to be efficient. This dual role - of sheltering resources and shaping future markets - is crucial to the process of value creation but has thus far been neglected in theories of the firm.  Our argument suggests that striving for sufficient profits to secure the firms continuity is an appropriate management objective, but maximizing profits is not.",theory of the firm| efficiency| innovation

Drawing upon recent research in organizational behavior, we argue that this results from the psychological rivalry that intense competition creates.  Within the context of the airline industry, we find that firms are more likely to take competitive action towards competitors who had attacked them in the past, even controlling for recent competitive exchanges.  Further, we observe that pairs of firms who were more evenly matched in performance and more similar in their resource profile years ago also direct greater competitive action towards one another.  This again occurs even controlling for more recent and current competitive conditions.  These findings extend existing work in competitive dynamics by exploring both psychological and historical factors, which have heretofore gone largely unstudied.  In contrast with prior work that has examined competitive moves in isolation or in short sequences, we argue that they are embedded in much longer relationships between firms, and that consideration of these relationships provides greater understanding of competitive dynamics.",rivalry| competition| competitive dynamics

Specifically, we study the impact of CSR on bank loans.   Using a dataset of 1,929 observations from 1996 to 2005, findings suggest that CSR has a negative impact on loan spread. In addition, CSR negatively moderates the effect of loan characteristics such as maturity, and firm characteristics such as leverage. We also find that CSR positively moderates the effect of a firms growth opportunities on spread.  Our study implies that CSR acts as a form of collateral which the firm puts on the line when transacting with stakeholders, including banks. This collateral results in the firm enjoying a favorable risk/ return profile.  However, CSR also consumes scarce managerial resources and may lead to trade-offs with economic opportunities, thus tempering its beneficial effects.

While most activities are well intentioned, many have only marginal and/or unsustainable outcomes and many do not address the social and political dynamics that cause the problems they set out to alleviate. In this paper, we distinguish extra-curricular activities from those that form part of an organizations DNA (i.e., its vision, mission and values) and strategy. We present a framework for thinking about CSR in a way that highlights behavior that is likely to create a true, false or schizophrenic social reputation.  Our framework provides management, investors, employees and other stakeholders with a useful basis for understanding a companys strategic or professed CSR capability.  According to this view, strategy defines the set of choices that the company deems appropriate to achieve some type of fundamental social objective in the environment in which it operates. When an organization bests its future on CSR, there is a good chance that it will behave more like the civil society it is trying to mimic.

The combination of the exploration-exploitation dimensions lead to different SM strategic focus Reactive, Adaptive, Proactive, and Disruptive which may help explain performance differentials across firms.

We offer a learning perspective to analyze when firms are most likely to benefit from leveraging owners prior experience, and we develop a contingency approach that allows us to make normative predictions regarding the direction and magnitude of ownership effects on firm performance. We test our hypotheses using extensive data in the IPO context, based on the entire population of private firms attempting to go public for the first time between 1997 and 2004 and all venture capital firms that invested in these private firms.  The supportive findings suggest that the likelihood to go public and the performance of the newly public firm are significantly affected by the match between the prior experience of these owners and the private firms needs.

However, the interaction between DCS and cost leadership strategy has a greater influence on firm performance than the interaction between DCS and differentiation strategy. Furthermore, the interaction between ICS and differentiation strategy influences firm performance more than the interaction between ICS and cost leadership strategy.

In general, distributed innovation is made possible by the modularity of the underlying product or process. But despite the documented technical benefits of modularity, history shows that it is not always straightforward for firms to capture value in a modular system. This paper brings together the theory of modularity from the engineering and management literatures with the modern economic theory of property rights and relational contracts to address the question of value appropriation. It defines three generic threats to intellectual property (IP) and models the interactive impact of modularity and state-sanctioned IP rights on these threats. It identifies strategies for capturing value in so-called open systems in which IP is distributed among several parties. It shows why open systems should be designed as modular systems.

We adopt a socio-cognitive approach to extend research on value creation by developing arguments on firms need to generate both homogeneous and heterogeneous discourses at various levels  organization and industry  and at different times in order to valorize their resource combinations and prevent value slippages. Our approach underlines the performativity of discourse as a particular kind of societal force and emphasizes organizational efforts toward influencing the interpretational domain.

We show how a small set of existing, well-established behavioral assumptions about how firms employ competitive actions can explain a rich variety of competitive behavior patterns. Our simulations corroborate the robust empirical finding that, generally, a high level of competitive activity leads to high performance. However, competitive actions also incur costs and increase the risk that rivals respond. By implication, managers cannot know with precision if they should increase competitive activity.

Drawing from imitation and competitive dynamics theory, our empirical results support developed hypotheses that there is a positive wealth effect relationship between attacking firms and responding firms, and response delay strongly and negatively moderates the relationship while market commonality significantly and positively moderates the relationship. Further, firms with nonresponse strategy conditional on negative wealth effect of attacking firms performs better in contrast to responding firms.

I argue that theory and empirical research on interorganizational relationships could be further enriched by articulating a sharper and more precise conceptualization of all of the forms of symbiosis, specifically, commensalism and parasitism. Further, I suggest shifting the focus on interorganizational relationships from the symmetric to the asymmetric.

Our results reveal that in highly commoditized markets managers rely upon the intense utilization of discrete operational capabilities to exploit market opportunities.  However, in highly differentiated markets these same managers depend upon interactions amongst co-specialized capabilities to explore new service offerings.

We use longitudinal data on warranty coverage provided by automobile manufacturers in the US market, from the first warranty provided by the industry in 1960 through to 2008 to show that signaling accuracy fluctuates substantially over time.

However, almost no major pool arrangement was established since the end of World War II due to the negative view of antitrust authorities towards the anti-competitive aspects of traditional patent pools. The formation of the MPEG-2 pool in 1997 and the following wave of modern pools led to a heated theoretical debate mainly predicting the pro-competitive nature of these pools. Yet, little empirical work has examined the matter so far. In this paper, I take one step towards addressing this gap by analyzing the effect of the MPEG-2 pool on the innovative performance of two groups of outsiders: firms with complementary technological knowledge, and firms with competing technological knowledge. Using difference-in-difference methodology, I show that the formation of the MPEG-2 pool had a substantial negative impact on the innovation rate of these two groups. Furthermore, I show that the estimated effect cannot be attributed to the increased litigation risk or increased competition intensity after the pool formation. Instead, the results suggest that a shift in the investment direction of firms from developing further technological inventions to implementing the pool technology into current and future products can explain the recession in the innovation rate of both groups.",patent pool| competitive effects| mechanisms

This study examines how firms grow in the face of these gaps by adding top management team (TMT) talent from different pools. We predict that the relevance and availability of new TMT talent will vary with the individuals prior TMT experience, as well as firm and industry background. Using data from the US cellular industry from 1983-1998, we measure the growth impact of rookie and experienced TMT additions from inside the firm, outside competitors, and outside the industry. We find that (1) rookie recruits from outside the firm have a larger positive impact than seasoned recruits from outside the firm; (2) rookie recruits from outside the firm have a larger positive impact than rookies from inside the firm; (3) the effect of recruits from outside the industry falls with industry age; and (4) more experienced top management teams incorporate seasoned executives with less disruption. The study adds to a small but growing set of studies highlighting how the knowledge embodied in managers below the top level plays a vital role as firms integrate new knowledge to change in dynamic settings.",strategic renewal| top management team| middle managers

To understand why firms strategies often diverge when decision-makers attend to the same stimulus, this article links the cognitive psychology and adaptive learning literatures to present the concept of attention to search. This suggests variation in decision-makers cognitive inclination towards local-nonlocal information processing as the reason why firms responses to a problem differ. Using ten-year panel data from industrial machinery and computer equipment companies, we find evidence for the theory that top management team (TMT) educational, functional and industry experiences influence TMT attention to search, which in turn affects firms restructuring and diversification decisions.

In this paper we study how different aspects of family ownership and control influence technology innovation in a firm. Prior literature has drawn mainly from principal-principal agency theory and stewardship theory to explain the influence of family involvement on various strategic decisions and outcomes in a firm. Arguments drawn from stewardship theory and institutional void frameworks support a positive influence of family control and business group affiliation on technology innovation. In contrast, arguments from principal-principal agency theory hypothesize a negative influence. Based on the above conflicting theoretical frameworks we study how family involvement in ownership, management and board of directors in a firm, and business group affiliation influence R&D investments and patents obtained by the firm. The hypotheses are empirically tested on a seven year panel of 172 firms from Indian pharmaceutical industry.  Results broadly support the stewardship theory and institutional voids framework as against the principal-principal agency predictions.  We find that family shareholding and family control over the CEO and chairperson position have a positive influence on firms investment in R&D. We also find a positive influence of group affiliation on investments in R&D and patents applied by the firm. We attribute the positive influence to high technological opportunity in Indian pharmaceutical industry. We further argue that higher technological opportunities reduce agency costs and facilitate stewardship behavior, in turn promoting innovation in family firms.",family firms| innovation| indian pharmaceutical industry

Drawing on network theory and business group literature, we demonstrate that multiplex ties in a business group may serve as either complements or substitutes in coordinating social capital accumulation and incentive alignment in the groups collective problem solving process. The net effect of tie multiplexity on group innovation depends on how the social capital accumulated is utilized, and to what extent incentive alignment is valued in group innovation. The longitudinal analysis of 92 Taiwanese business groups shows that multiplex ties mainly complement each other in facilitating group innovation in groups with a high level of family involvement.

By distinguishing codified knowledge flows from tacit knowledge flows, this paper demonstrates that antecedents of interfirm cooperation lie in codified knowledge flows that precede interfirm cooperation. Two properties of asymmetry in directional codified knowledge flows, intensity and uncertainty, underpin this papers arguments and empirical tests. We find that intense codified knowledge flows weaken the formation of interfirm cooperation. By mapping dyadic firms to a center and a periphery firm within a knowledge network, this paper explains that the intensity and the uncertainty of directional codified knowledge flows provide different incentives for the center and the periphery firms to pursue interfirm cooperation. With intense codified knowledge in-flows, a periphery firm avoids more interfirm cooperation than a center firm. While uncertainty caused by distant technology components in knowledge flows hinders a center firm from pursuing interfirm cooperation, uncertainty stimulates a periphery firm to pursue interfirm cooperation. A statistical analysis performed on a sample of enterprise software firms between 1992 and 2009 supports the hypotheses of this paper.",knowledge flow| interfirm cooperation| enterprise software industry

This paper compares the performance consequences of organizational reconfigurations with those of organizational restructurings in different environments and in different sequences. Our dynamic panel data analysis of reconfigurations and restructurings in large US corporations between 1985 and 2004 finds that performance consequences depend critically on the contingencies under which they are carried out. Whereas reconfiguration outcomes are negative in general, in dynamic environments reconfiguration outcomes are positive, on a market measure at least. On the other hand, while restructuring outcomes are positive in general, they are negative both in dynamic environments and when following prior bursts of reconfigurations.",reorganization| dynamic capabilities| change

Bowen|Queens U. of Charlotte||3|Kurt Matzler|U. of Innsbruck||4|Christian Stadler|U. of Bath||,,"Relatedness - the extent of synergy among a firms portfolio of business  is a key construct in strategic management. For a diversified firm, higher relatedness is theoretically predicted to create superior firm performance. Despite recognition that relatedness is a multidimensional construct, most quantitative measures capture only technological relatedness and hence ignore relatedness on the customer side of a firms value chain. Moreover, the few recent studies that consider customer side relatedness have yielded ambiguous results regarding its importance for firm performance. This paper conjectures that this ambiguity reflects methodological limitations and potential biases inherent in these prior studies since they have derived their results using single year cross-section samples on a relatively small number of firms.  These limitations largely arise from reliance in prior research on surveys to develop their measures of customer side relatedness. In response, this paper proposes and implements a general method to quantitatively measure technological and customer relatedness for a large number of firms and over time. We then investigate the implications of our relatedness measures for firm performance in a model that captures that relatedness and firm performance are jointly and simultaneously determined, and hence endogenous variables. Using panel data on U.S. manufacturing firms from 1984 to 2004, we estimate our model to derive both the direct and indirect effects of technological and customer relatedness on firm performance.  The indirect effects arise from proposing and estimating, for the first time, direct relationships between technological and customer relatedness. Our model captures variation both over time and across firms, and its estimation statistically controls for endogeneity biases arising from firm heterogeneity and the simultaneity between relatedness and firm performance. Our model and its estimation therefore constitute important methodological contributions toward addressing the diversification strategy-firm performance relationship. Unlike prior studies, our results indicate that both technological and customer relatedness have a significant and positive direct effect on firm performance. Our results also indicate that these two sources of relatedness are complementary, and hence that each has a positive indirect effect on firm performance. These findings have both important theoretical and practical implications regarding the efficacy of pursuing alternative strategies of diversification along a firms value chain.",relatedness| diversification| firm performance

Recent economic strategy maintains that improving quality for market entrants can greatly increase their chance of becoming a market leader. For socio-cultural reasons, we argue that once the standard setting and market leadership processes are complete, speed with close copying (fast following) is more likely to be successful. Furthermore, in order to follow fast, firms need to rely on specific rather than general knowledge, but complement this knowledge with diverse first- and second-order co-production networks, making it difficult to switch production strategies. We support these claims using over time analyses of 143 imitative video game launches of the 10 hit game standards that were created between 1985 and 2003 in the U.S. video game market.",imitation| speed vs. quality| video game

This research takes into account this dimension by extending the debate over the relationship between rational strategic planning and firm performance. It highlights criticisms of previous empirical studies which generally studied only direct and bivariate relationships producing unclear and contradictory results. The reasons for the results contradiction are multiple, some authors noted that it is due to methodological errors, while others thought that the results contradiction is perhaps due to the fact that rational strategic planning may indirectly affect firm performance (Rudd et al., 2008). In other terms, the last group of authors argued that there are mediator variables that would explain the relationship between rational strategic planning and firm performance. For this reason, this research takes into account this view by attempting to examine the mediating effect of employee strategic alignment on rational strategic planning-firm performance relationship. To this end, a quantitative empirical study has been conducted among European firms reveals the following results: first, rational strategic planning affects positively and significantly employee strategic alignment. Second, we have observed that employee strategic alignment has a positive and significant effect on both financial and non-financial performance. Accordingly, we concluded that employee strategic alignment plays a mediating role in the relationship between rational strategic planning and firm performance.

Hence, researchers must now extend their research efforts to organizations working in other countries which were previously excluded. Thus, the present study uses data from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), to examine whether slack and planning, which are of special importance at the moment in this recently established country, contribute toward or inhibit organizational performance. The results of a survey of 214 respondents show that both the slack and the comprehensiveness of strategic decisions are important predictors of organizational performance and that the impact of slack and comprehensiveness on organizational performance varies with the age of an organization. Interestingly, our study shows that, in UAE organizations, the extensiveness of strategic planning does not influence organizational performance and even the age of an organization does not play a moderating role in this relationship.Paper is No Longer Available Online: Please contact the author(s).Despite of the strong research stream on both strategic planning process and organizational integration, we still know little about participatory strategic planning process and its role as an integrative mechanism.

Several previous works indicate that firms seem to have problems implementing their strategies in an appropriate way. This fact should be of great concern as strategy implementation is at least as important for firm performance as strategy formulation. Interestingly, strategy implementation research seems to be virtually neglected by the scientific community as only around 10 percent of previous strategy process literature deals with strategy implementation whereas around 90 percent is concerned with strategy formulation issues. After analyzing important strategy implementation factors, a conceptual framework is proposed incorporating eleven strategy implementation factors. Instead of applying a universal view, it is argued that different strategies require different strategy implementation skills. The findings based on 175 responses from executives of medium and large size Austrian firms support six out of 13 hypotheses. The results of profile deviation analysis show that it is crucial for prospectors and analyzers to align their strategy implementation factors according to their strategy content. Interestingly, the degree of alignment in defender firms has no impact on firm performance. Moreover, the cross sectional data set demonstrates that an overdoing (over-fit) of strategy implementation factors does not play any crucial part in influencing firm performance while underemphasizing (under-fit) has a negative impact. Contrary to expectations, strategy implementation still significantly influences firm performance regardless of whether strategy content is aligned with the environment or not.",strategy implementation| firm performance| configuration approach

Accordingly, this paper contributes to extant theory by integrating emotional displays into the relationship between knowledge transfer and firm performance. We ask if and how knowledge transfer, in the form of verbal transmission as well as emotional displays, effects firm performance. The concept of emotional knowledge transfer is introduced, capturing the impact that individuals emotional displays have on the marketplace.  Testable hypotheses are derived that explore the relationship between emotional and explicit knowledge transfer and the effects they have on firm performance. We use a short-term event study analyzed using a combinatory methodology to explore the impact of emotional knowledge transfer by analyzing a sample of recorded CEO interviews. Findings indicate that emotional knowledge transfer effects firm performance even in the presence of contradictory explicit knowledge transfer; thus, emotionally transferred knowledge is shown to take precedence over explicit knowledge.  These findings indicate that emotion is a seminal individual-level foundation of firm performance.  We conclude by raising the strategic implications of these results.",knowledge| emotional displays| combinatory approach

Our core arguments draw from two traditions of routines research: the capabilities perspective and the practice perspective. We argue that the recurring nature of interactions in a routine results in exchanges among actors coalescing around common times, which shapes the ostensive patterns of employees and provides customers with an opportunity to establish co-organized ostensive patterns; these ostensive patterns of employees and customers guide their subsequent performances of the routine. As a result, greater consistency in the timing of a routine performance reduces the incidence of errors because it reduces the potential for conflict and exchange problems among employees and their customers. We argue that this effect will be weaker (i.e., less negative) when there is change in contextual conditions, and stronger (i.e., more negative) when there is greater consistency in the timing of past routine performances.

Our findings are based on a sample of 52 studies comprising 54 independent samples investigated over the last two decades. Our results suggest that environmental dynamism moderates the effects of both ordinary and dynamic capabilities on firm performance. Further, ordinary capabilities in both stable and rapidly changing industry environments tend to have a higher influence on firm performance than dynamic capabilities. However, rapid changes in the environment of the country in which a firm is operating enhance the effects of dynamic capabilities on performance even more strongly than those of ordinary capabilities.

The research question examined in this paper is how organizational processes such as knowledge management and managerial processes such as the coordination between top managers specifically lead to dynamic capabilities. After reviewing the literature, we review several case studies and examine in detail the impact of these particular organizational and managerial processes on dynamic capabilities.  Our first case is a healthcare firm that used a managerial process; however, this firm did not achieve a dynamic capability.  The other two cases specifically illustrate how a financial services firm used an organizational process and how a manufacturing firm used a managerial process to develop dynamic capabilities.

The first one understands dynamic capabilities as higher-order collective routines (e.g., R&D, product development, post-merger integration), premised on a central role of individual habits. It is criticized by those scholars who see learned, semi-automatic routines as insufficient to engender the radical regeneration in organizational capabilities required in dynamic environments (e.g.,Schreyogg & Kliesch-Eberl, 2007; Teece, 2007). The second position understands capabilities dynamization as the outcome of rapid learning and the tailored and logically-structured solutions advanced by organizational leaders (e.g., ad-hoc problem solving, improvisation, single and cognitively sophisticated solutions). It is premised on a central role of managerial autonomy and self-determination. This position is criticized for doing away with the proven routine-based selection patterns and operating rules that allow organizations to both observe and handle environmental developments (e.g., Helfat et al., 2007; Winter, 2003). We claim that this conundrum results from somehow incomplete models of humans espoused by each position. We propose a new model, based on Personalism, which provides the foundations for parsimoniously integrating the two opposite positions by harmoniously integrating habits and self-determination. We describe the basic elements of capabilities dynamization premised on this alternative model of humans and call for a Person-centric view of strategy and organizations (Ghoshal, 2005; Ghoshal, Bartlett & Moran, 1999).",evolutionary theory| strategic and organizational change| dynamic capabilities

Given these challenges, more often than not, organizations will deviate from the intended balance. In this paper, we use an NK simulation model to examine the performance implications of such deviations. We find that if organizations cannot take for granted that they can achieve the (theoretically) right mix between exploration and exploitation, i.e., if the mix that they actually pursue deviates systematically from the optimal one, long-run performance suffers. If deviations are random, in contrast, long-run performance needs not be affected. In both cases, however, the organization will be better off pursuing a mix that is tilted towards exploitation. The performance effects we find are driven by the asymmetric implications of under-and overexploration. More generally, our study offers an alternative explanation for why the balance between exploration and exploitation is tilted towards exploitation in many organizations.",exploration| exploitation| balancing

These committee structures have well-defined authority relationships and oversight responsibilities and exhibit several key characteristics of hierarchy. We demonstrate that monitoring needs arising from moral hazard and knowledge misappropriation risk, as well as coordination needs arising from increased partner interdependence, are key determinants of such administrative mechanisms in the governance of non-equity alliances.",strategic alliances| governance| high-tech collaborations

To address this, we suggest that the two alliance modes present different real options trade-offs in adaptation to environmental uncertainty. As a consequence, we expect that organizations in more uncertain environments will be relatively more likely to place time bounds on their strategic alliances. Findings from longitudinal data collected amongst a large sample of firms in 38 industry clusters are consistent with our expectations, and contribute to the recent renaissance of Resource Dependence Theory by specifying the conditions under which organizations choose different time windows in strategic partnering, and to strategic alliance research by separating planned termination out of duration-based performance measures.",strategic alliance| time/temporality| resource dependence

Specifically, we investigate motivation factors at multiple levels: firm-specific knowledge resources, portfolio technological diversity, and industry network density.

Moreover, Chamber distance disproportionately influences senators with few alternative venues for interaction or low organizational tenure, suggesting that geographic constraints do not bind uniformly.

Through regression analyses of novel data from a project-based industry, the paper tests the association between embeddedness and economic performance in different markets, finding a positive association in the domestic market, but a negative association in foreign markets.

Effects of Alliance Governance Experience on Value Creation,1|Rui Wu|Tsinghua U.||,,"Alliance research has shown that alliance formation creates value for allied partners, and that the value increases when participants have greater alliance experience. Drawing from the organizational learning perspective, alliance experience research has yet to examine to what extent governance structural features influence experience effects. This paper fills this gap by analyzing the role of governance forms in alliance experience, and suggests that experience in and across alliance governance forms fosters different types of capabilities. In-depth experience in a specific governance structure, when used again in a newly formed alliance, attracts positive market assessment due to the benefit of exploitative learning. This exploitation effect is strengthened by exploration in governance experience: With alliance experience across different governance forms, a focal firm is capable of making well-informed and thus more appropriate governance decisions than firms with narrow governance experience. I further find that the main effects of governance experience become more salient when the focal firm has an intermediate level of performance and joins an alliance with an intermediate degree of governance hierarchy.

Using data from biotechnology alliances, we examine how retaining rights to participate in the commercialization process affects the hazard of drug approval in the short run. We find that when less-experienced firms retain these so-called co-development rights, the product is less likely to be approved.

The question arises which factors facilitate the development of these marketing traits. To contribute to an answer, the authors analyze the effect of cross-functional marketing-finance and marketing-R&D integration on marketing accountability and marketing performance measurement ability and analyze whether close interaction and collaboration, especially with the financial management-proficient finance function, help marketing to develop and refine its respective skills. Furthermore, they take a contingency perspective and examine the moderating role of uncertainty related to high levels of innovativeness. Based on partly dyadic survey data from 318 companies, the results provide evidence for the positive influence of cross-functional marketing-finance and marketing-R&D integration on marketing accountability.

Grounded in the agency theory, this study explores whether the separation of ownership and control in firms can be an essential determinant of the valuation effect of JVs. Based on a sample of 792 U.S. firms' JV investments, the evidence shows that executives holding lower levels of ownership and compensated by less equity result in inferior JV performance. The probability of managers' self-serving behaviors in JVs is further supported by the finding of stronger interest alignment effect by incentive mechanism in a more severe agency problem situation, assessed by levels of firm free cash flow and business relatedness between a firm and its JV activities. The interest alignment effect between managerial ownership and equity-based compensation is found to be unequal, probably due to their different efficacies in motivating risk-takings in JVs. We obtain consist findings with performance measured by short-run stock market reaction and long-run performance of JVs. The results as well are not sensitive to different event windows and potential bias of repeated announcements. These findings suggest that when seeking value-maximization in JV investments, managers' individual concerns should not be neglected.

Given that this is a heavily researched domain, we use the power of meta-analysis to examine the unique and at times competing effects of four of the most commonly studied risk-taking choices on firm risk and firm performance. Results from a meta-analysis of 161 unique studies (N = 251,569; overall k=170) demonstrate support for our proposed framework and cast significant doubt on the idea that commonly studied firm risk-taking choices theoretically aggregate into one overarching risk-taking construct.",firm risk| risk-taking| meta-analysis

This paper highlights the independent aspirations of external investors, and the challenges that arise when favorable external conditions cause external aspirations to exceed a firms internal capacity.  Due to the perceived temporariness of favorable conditions, managers rush to achieve these higher external aspirations, squandering resources and producing the counterintuitive result of negative performance outcomes under favorable external conditions.  Using data from initial public offerings (IPOs) of Internet-related companies before and during the bubble in equity valuations that occurred in 1999-2000, we find that despite highly favorable access to capital, firms increasing growth aspirations beyond the range of their administrative capacity hastened their demise instead of prolonging success.",aspirations| bubble| ipo

We are looking at upward and downward strategizing activities (e.g. Floyd & Wooldridge, 1997) as part of middle manager's strategic role expectations and argue that the engagement in these strategic activities is affected by role ambiguity and role conflict as experienced by middle management. Our insights from a multiple case study suggest that the formalization of strategic planning processes reduces issues of role ambiguity and role conflict and therefore positively influences strategic role performance. Based on the case insights, we distinguish between two dimensions of formalizing strategic planning - namely by formalizing outputs of this process and formalizing characteristics of the process itself. Organizations with higher formalization (especially in the process dimension) seem to be more successful in encouraging middle managers to engage in their strategic roles. In summary, our findings suggest that formal strategic planning opens the way for middle managers to have a more substantive influence on strategy development.",middle managers| strategic planning

Despite numerous accounts showing its potential to lead to competitive advantage, the understanding of how and under what conditions firms introduce management innovations is still surprisingly limited. This study proposes that processes that influence the learning capacity of TMTs play an important role in stimulating management innovation. More specifically, we propose that TMT reflexivity and TMT minority dissent enhance management innovation as they provide a continuous check of the appropriateness of management practices for achieving firm goals. Furthermore, we argue that these managerial learning processes are more effective in enhancing management innovation in firms with a high level of absorptive capacity.

We further explain why incumbent directors are especially likely to be influenced by the recategorization process when the new director has more prior shared board appointments with incumbent directors. We then suggest that recategorization may reduce the negative impact of out-group categorization on minorities' influences and result in 1) longer tenures of minority directors, 2) a higher likelihood of minority directors serving on key board committees, and 3) a greater possibility of minority directors serving as major board committee chairs.

Using data from Standard and Poors 1500 firms, we find that board committee overlap due to linking pin directors is indeed associated with increased monitoring effectiveness, after controlling for all other traditional governance and firm-level determinants of CEO compensation. We also find that the emergence of these overlaps is associated with increased monitoring effectiveness, leading to a suppression of aspects of CEO compensation like stock options.  Next, we find that when audit committee members join the compensation committee, there is less reliance on options compensation relative to cases where a compensation committee member joins the audit committee.  Finally, we examine whether such board overlaps may indeed be all the more important in the presence of agency problems such as earnings management.

In this study, we challenge this notion by arguing that although highly hubristic CEOs may be arrogant, they are not ignorant.  Building from self-regulation theory, we theorize that more hubristic CEOs recognize the consequences of their aggressive personal biases and use coping mechanisms of internal organizational control to mitigate the risks they create.  Employing a novel data collection approach for a sample of 142 S&P 500 CEOs, we find broad support for our theory.  We first demonstrate that highly hubristic CEOs are more likely to pursue acquisitions and spend heavily on acquisitions than their more modest peers.  In line with our self-regulation logic, we also find that more hubristic CEOs deliver higher employee productivity, maintain more conservative capital structures, and more effectively buffer the core of their businesses.  Our work provides a new path for executive leadership research by showing that CEOs use coping mechanisms to regulate the consequences of their biases, suggesting a more balanced and even a positive effect of hubris in organizations.

We argue that in a negative attainment discrepancy context, high values of option grants will increase the risk aversion of CEOs who already bear excessive employment and compensation risks, resulting in lower R&D intensity; however, it will enhance the monitoring and risk-seeking propensity of outside directors interested in improving firm performance, leading to higher R&D intensity. In a positive attainment discrepancy context high values of option grants will amplify risk aversion in both CEOs and outside directors due to a gain domain, inducing less R&D spending.

The standard analytic technique for gauging the influence of chief executive officers (CEOs) on organizational performance is variance partition methodology (VPM).  Using large data panels, researchers partition the distinct effects of several categorical factors, operationalized as large sets of dummy variables, for year, industry, firm, and  ultimately  the CEO.  However, this use of long-panel dummies is exceedingly problematic because it illogically treats some of the CEOs impact as part of the context in which he or she is operating, resulting in systematic underestimation of CEO influence in general and fallacious estimates of the effects of many individual CEOs.  We introduce a new method for estimating CEO effects which more accurately contextualizes each CEOs contribution to performance.  Examining a panel of 705 CEOs over a 19-year period (for a total of 3994 CEO-years), we show that our new approach points to a much larger aggregate CEO effect than is obtained from prevailing methods; moreover we validate our method through both a simulation and by showing substantially different  and more logical  estimates of the effects of many individual CEOs than are obtained through customary analyses.",ceo effect| firm performance| upper echelons

We also argue that the compensation required to secure board capital has increased since the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

We introduce the concept of structural interdependence, or the degree to which roles and administrative mechanisms are arranged such that members of an executive group influence each others behaviors and performance. We empirically demonstrate the potential for structural independence to resolve much of the ambiguity regarding the effects of TMT composition. Starting with the classic hypothesis that TMT heterogeneity brings about high rates of executive departures, we then incorporate our new construct, hypothesizing that structural interdependence will exacerbate the association between TMT heterogeneity and turnover. Based on a multi-year sample of TMTs in 109 information technology firms, we find that all three facets of structural interdependence we examine  horizontal, vertical, and reward interdependence  substantially amplify the association between TMT heterogeneity and executive turnover.

Furthermore, we find evidence of selective imitation as this positive relationship is stronger when the tied-to firms are more profitable.

Accordingly, since its rival's executive turnover is recognized as an opportunity to attack, a focal firm would engage in competitive actions against its rival more frequently when it experiences greater executive turnover. This relationship is strengthened by the non-routineness of the selection of the rival's incoming executives, but is weakened by the focal firm's market share relative to the rival.

Using longitudinal financial panel data for 605 public technology firms, our findings demonstrate that the effects of exploration and exploitation on firm performance are curvilinear; in other words, both exploration and exploitation efforts have optimal levels of effective intensity at which the firms performance is highest (inverted U-shaped relationships). Furthermore, these curvilinear relationships between exploration and exploitation with performance are moderated by environmental conditions (dynamism and competitiveness) and differ for short-term and long-term performance outcomes.

We find that, next to dynamism, resource scarcity is an important driver for performance stemming from exploration and exploitation: even under conditions that involve low dynamism, but joined with low munificence, firms may benefit from exploring and exploiting simultaneously.",environmental dynamism and munificence| exploration vs. exploitation| financial performance

Kim|Columbia U.||,,"How do firms change search behaviors as a response to environmental change? There are two competing streams of thoughts; organizational ecology and organizational learning. Based on these perspectives, a number of scholars have argued that a firm's response to environmental change should be considered within the contextual characteristics of the change. In other words, a firm's response to external change is contingent upon whether the environment is threatening or munificent. However, can we say that all firms, to the large extent, react to environmental change similarly? Building on the well-known notion that firms are heterogeneous in their resources, we explore the heterogeneity in firm's response to environmental change. More specifically, we look at how the enactment of the Hatch-Waxman Act in 1984 affected firms in the pharmaceutical industry and explore how regulatory change shapes the inimitability of the core resource of firms to dictate the strategic response of firms to environmental turbulence. The results indicate that a firm reacts to the environmental change differently depending on the change of their resource imitability caused by the regulation change.",environmental change| exploration and exploitation| resource-based view

Eggers|New York U.||2|Elad Green|New York U.||,,"A large body of work in the Behavioral Theory of the Firm tradition focuses on processes through which firms search for new opportunities yet largely assumes or implies a fundamentally sequential character to the search process. Firms, however, typically engage simultaneously in multiple R&D projects. To capture the simultaneous pursuit of multiple competing paths, this paper defines parallel search by emphasizing the timing and direction of search efforts. We theoretically and empirically examine the antecedents and consequences of parallel search, focusing on behavioral drivers related to feedback from the environment. Empirical analyses are conducted on patent data in the secondary (rechargeable) battery industry. Findings indicate that environmental feedback is an important input for firm decision-making regarding the nature and direction of search efforts, and that successful parallel search involves balancing a delicate trade-off between risk reduction and productivity gain.",parallel search| innovation| behavioral theory of the firm

Specifically, we focus on industry factors that affect the formation of a marketplace for technological inventions. These factors are analyzed using a proprietary sample of twelve online marketplaces which serve up to 70% of all manufacturing industries. We find that a given industry is more likely to be served by online markets for technology (a) the higher the cost of searching for technologies in that industries, and (b) the greater the level of information asymmetries between sellers and buyers of inventions. Other industry characteristics, including the ability to protect inventions from appropriation also affect an industrys tendency of being served by an online market for ideas.",market for technology| search costs| appropriation

We argue that effectively leveraging internet-based collaboration technologies and online communities for product innovation requires careful consideration of a community's composition and the organizational processes and mechanisms for engaging the community in joint development or co-innovation. We focus on community engagements that generate private goods for a host firm and consider two types of communities: crowd-based and expert-based. Building on literature on user innovation, open innovation, and demand side value creation, we offer theory and propositions on how a firm can structure interactions and manage community engagements to facilitate productive innovation.  More specifically, we propose that, in the context of product innovation, a firm may enhance value creation from online communities when it: 1) employs expertsourcing vs. crowdsourcing, 2) uses internet-based collaboration technologies to facilitate interative content development among community members and between community members and the host firm; 3) allows for task or problem evolution during a community engagement; 4) involves community members in content management; and 5) time-bounds the duration of a communitys work on a task or problem. Interviews with executives in firms using collaboration technologies for innovation help us to refine our theory. By specifying the above, we are able to be clearer than prior work about the conditions for creating value when engaging online communities in co-innovation.",co-innovation| crowdsourcing| social media

This paradigm shift induces significant changes to the organization design of producer firms. Even though the research field of user innovation has been developing over a period of more than four decades, there have been only occasional intersections with the research field of organizational design. In this paper we aim to provide an integrated perspective of the two research fields. We first discriminate different user innovation strategies by distinguishing two dimensions: The number of users that are involved in the innovation efforts of a focal producer firm and the sustainability of user involvement. This allows us to (1) distinguish four different user innovation strategies that a focal producer firm can employ, and to (2) identify the corresponding challenges for organization design based on the framework from Burton and Obel (2004). We then analyze the implications of each of the four user innovation strategies on key dimensions of organization design. Our analysis reveals that user innovation approaches that are executed as one shot games primarily affect the human components of organizational design. We also argue that the more a focal producer firm aims to involve users into its new product development efforts on a sustainable basis, the more it needs to complement changes in the human components with changes in the structural components of organizational design. We conclude with an outlook on symbiotic producer-user ecosystems and the corresponding implications for organizational design.",user-driven innovation| organization design

However, it is as yet unclear whether and how this individual-level increase in external search efforts impacts individuals ideation performance, and which factors might moderate this process in turn. Using a sample of 355 R&D scientists and engineers working at a large, mature organization, we examine the relationship between individuals openness to external sources of knowledge on their ability to develop new, useful innovative ideas for their organization. Drawing from theories of combinatorial search, we theorize  and empirically substantiate  that the openness to external ideas is curvilinearly related to ideation, indicating that benefits of openness to external sources are positive until they reach a point where negative returns set in. Probing this relationship more deeply, we examine how individuals R&D time horizons, size of market, and knowledge breadth moderate the costs and benefits of openness. We elaborate on the implications of these results for the strategic use of openness in the innovation process for both individuals and organizations.",open innovation| ideation| combinatorial search

The burgeoning literature on networks and innovation argues that network ties are a source of trust, information sharing, and reciprocal exchange that enable connected firms to more effectively innovate.  Altogether, the overarching thrust of this research has therefore suggested that ties facilitate innovation.  But this assertion runs counter to theories of competition and innovation.  In this paper we seek to reconcile these disparate literatures on innovation.  In particular, we investigate how ties to competitors may negatively impact innovation.  We develop hypotheses (and attendant theoretical mechanisms) that connect competitor ties to innovation.   We do so using a data set of VC-backed firms in a complete segment of the medical device industry across 22 years.  We hypothesize and test a variety of scope conditions for the impact of indirect ties to competitors on innovation. We find that although indirect ties to competitors negatively impacts innovation, this effect can be mitigated through the sequence of tie formation, and through the strength of tie to the investor.   Our findings help extend network research to consider the potential negative sides of ties and contribute to research on competition and innovation.  Moreover, our findings suggest strategies for new firms that desperately need investors, yet must continue to innovate in order to survive.",innovation| competition| networks

While initial research pointed at a linear positive impact of open innovation on performance, recent theoretical and empirical research suggests that the intensity of a company's collaboration with external innovation partners has an inverted U-shaped relationship with performance. However, some studies report even negative relationships between external collaboration and innovation performance highlighting the risks associated with open innovation. This paper argues that the divergent findings can be explained by internal and external mo derators to the collaborations performance relationship. Based on a sample of 110 innovative university spin-offs, the empirical results indicate that collaboration capability mitigates potential negative effects of innovation collaboration. Also, increasing intensity of innovation collaboration fosters sales growth only under conditions of low technological competition in the company's environment: Contrary to our expectations, innovation collaborations in an environment of high technological competition seem not to be a source of competitive advantage for spin-offs.Implications for innovation management and spin-off management practice as well as policy development conclude the paper.",innovation| collaboration| capabilities

Exploitative technological alliances on the other hand are generally conceptualized as bringing together technological and commercial capabilities of alliance partners. This paper provides additional insights to this stream of research by studying complementary technological specialization between alliance partners as a strategy to exploit technological capabilities. In order to shed light on factors conducive to this strategy this paper analyzes the effects of pre-alliance technological capability overlap and alliance experience on complementary specialization. Development of technological capabilities is measured by patent citation counts and an empirical measure for complementary specialization is developed. Empirical tests on 1,441 alliances suggest that there is an inverted-U shaped relationship between pre-alliance capability overlap and complementary specialization and that the effect of capability overlap becomes stronger at higher levels of alliance experience.",complementary specialization| alliance| exploitation

One of the ways to engage in innovation is through inter-organizational relationships. Unfortunately, inter-organizational relationships frequently do not result in the expected performance and innovation. The primary way to govern inter-organizational relationships is by means of a contract; yet, the majority of contracts are not conducive for innovation. A relatively new contracting type which is suggested to foster innovation is the performance-based contract. PBCs underline the outcome of the service rather than stating how to deliver it. As a consequence, PBCs leave more room for innovation. However, academic literature provides no guidance on how PBCs lead to innovation. By means of a literature review we develop a framework and related hypotheses that outline how PBCs lead to innovation. We develop the statement that innovation hinges upon the collaboration between the partners, the providers autonomy, creativity and risk, and innovation incentives. These factors are enabled by the contract duration (long-term) of a PBC, its (low) specificity level, and reward schemes. Finally, relationship orientation and providers risk averseness positively moderate the effects of contract duration on collaboration and providers risk on innovation respectively.",innovation| performance based contract| business services

Leiponen|Cornell U.||2|Henry Delcamp|Mines-Paristech||,,"We empirically examine the effects of industry consortia on the coordination of innovation strategies of the members in the global wireless telecommunications industry. Our analyses utilize membership data from 32 consortia in wireless telecommunications technology subfields from 2000 to 2005 and citations from patents declared essential for the third-generation wireless telecommunication standard UMTS. Our results shed new light on the role of consortia in enabling the coordination of innovation in a network-technological industry. We find that co-membership of two firms in an informal technical consortium significantly increases the likelihood that they cite each others patents in subsequent UMTS essential patents. In other words, inventions that are likely to become part of the UMTS telecommunication system tend to build on inventions by peers that were members in the same consortia, controlling for patent or firm fixed effects, technology class, and other characteristics. On one hand, consortia may enhance productivity of innovation and increase the incentives to invest in R&D by internalizing potential innovation externalities. On the other hand, informal consortia structure and constrain the process of innovating standardized technologies. This growing role could be viewed as problematic, because the process may not be truly accessible for all the interested parties. Policymakers thus need to balance these two effects. For managers, the results show that participation in a variety of technical consortia enables influencing peers innovation strategies related to the relevant global compatibility standards.",standard setting| innovation| cooperation

The empirical investigation employs a unique dataset on all tire producers worldwide between 1985 and 1996 and combines detailed firm level data on establishment, patenting, and alliance activities with dyadic constructs to explain the observed web of interactions. My findings indicate that exploitative interactions are driven by complementarity in terms of partners' characteristics, namely size, age, technological capabilities, diversification strategies; moreover, unrelated (market) diversity of firms and similarity in production portfolios are important for these agreements. Oppositely, explorative agreements exhibit strong partner similarity across all firm characteristics, as well as in technology and production space.

A positive, but with diminishing-returns, relation is found between APD and the share of incremental innovative performance.

The research model is tested using patent, publication and alliance data of 222 biotechnology firms from 1990-2000. Technology brokering in our study refers to the extent to which patents applied by sample firms have referred to patents from diverse classes other than the focal patents' own class. The results confirm the positive association between diverse alliance portfolio and technology brokering and that the relationship is strengthened by focal firm's familiarity of its partners with prior horizontal alliances but not partners with prior vertical alliances. Further, familiarity among portfolio partners has an overall enhancing effect. From our interviews with some founders of biotech firms, we can infer from the findings that familiarity of partners provide not only the strategic direction for finding potentially valuable knowledge but also the experience crucial for knowledge recombination.",technology brokering| alliance portfolio| technological diversity

Moreover, when inventors incorporate geographically distant knowledge in their innovations, we expect the value of knowledge maturity to be enhanced. In turn, incorporating technologically distant knowledge or waiting for knowledge to become diffused in the industry is likely to mitigate the value of knowledge maturity. Analysis of the citation patterns associated with 5,575 biotechnology patents of firms operating in the United States between 1985 and 2002 offers support to our conjectures.

These findings explain that the market and technological searches are interrelated parts of a system. When market opportunities are understood better, scientists need to refine their technology accordingly and initiate technological search. When a technology is developed further, market opportunities need to be adjusted based on the renewed technological details.

This paper builds on behavioral and prospect theory, particularly, on the literature on managerial risk taking in order to explore the motivational influences on individual mobility across firms in the pharmaceutical industry - specifically how performance deviations from specific reference points (aspirations) explain the likelihood of mobility (a risky action). Our results suggest that when the inventor is performing above her aspiration levels (both historical and social), she is less likely to engage in mobility. For an inventor performing below her aspiration level, we found support for risk taking actions (i.e. more mobility) only for social aspiration levels. Thus mobility is most likely when inventors perform below their social aspiration levels.",aspiration levels| inventors mobility| patents

Several major aspects differentiate this work from previous papers in the literature: it focuses on scientific breakthroughs as opposed to technological breakthroughs; it brings individual level data to a question which has previously focused on the publication, patent or organization as the unit of analysis, or remained mainly theoretical; and finally, it attempts to use data in the years prior to breakthrough to predict the breakthrough by bringing together several predictive theories into one single study. We focus on covariates of interest that have deeply rooted theoretical foundations but very little consensus: whether breakthroughs arise at the core or periphery of the community, whether they come from scientists early or later in their careers, whether they are invented by specialists versus generalists and whether they arise from a brokerage versus a cohesive network position.

Collaborative research projects are viewed as the key to achieving this objective, however, the management role of principal investigators (PIs) within these complex multi-stakeholder research projects remains under researched. This paper explores how networks in the scientific knowledge collaboration process are initiated and maintained from a multi-stakeholder perspective.  It is based on case study evidence from 82 stakeholders in 17 research collaboration projects in Irish and German universities. Qualitative interviews with multiple stakeholders, including PIs, centre managers, Technology Transfer Office (TTO) managers, industry partners and government funding agents, facilitate the analysis of the true value of the PIs role. This provides for a holistic view of the process, as opposed to prior research which has tended to report findings based on the analysis of one or two stakeholders. It finds that PIs play a lead role in establishing and managing stakeholder networks. This finding is unanimous for all stakeholders, irrespective of research centre size, type and geographical location.  Not unlike the entrepreneur, the PI has to be a jack of all trades', taking on the roles of project manager, negotiator, resource acquirer as well as, the traditional academic role of Ph.D. supervision and mentoring. The paper also finds that stakeholder networks act as conduits for commercialising knowledge.

A wider range of project contributions may re-sult in authorship, and social factors appear to play a larger role in authorship decisions than in inventorship decisions. We also find evidence that project contribution and social factors interact in predicting authorship, suggesting that the two sets of factors should be considered jointly rather than seen as independent determinants of attribution.

Using the difference-in-differences analysis of the U.S. nanotechnology patents filed between 1996 and 2007, we find that, for U.S. universities, the NNI has increased knowledge inflows from the industry, diminished the branching-out to novel technologies, reduced the research scope, and decreased the likelihood of technological breakthroughs, as compared to other U.S. and non-U.S. research institutions.

Specifically, we examine how a firms approach to innovation based on the use of diverse, distant, and distinctive knowledge that is beneficial to its efforts to develop knowledge-based resources may actually complicate its ability to capture value from these resources in financial markets. This may be because such an approach to innovation hinders securities analysts efforts to evaluate a firms strategy, which may make them less willing to provide a firm with coverage that can ultimately help it attract financial resources.

However, products also have their own unique reputations, and the effects of these reputations have yet to garner any systematic investigation.  In this paper, we study the speed with which products are released after an incident of reputation incongruence, or divergence between cumulative firm-level reputation for product quality and the reputation of the firms most recently introduced product.  We hypothesize that reputation incongruence will speed up the introduction of a firms next product(s).  We test this theory in the context of the U.S. video/computer game industry, analyzing a sample of 4,349 games released between 1996 and 2010 by 197 game publishers.  Results indicate that reputation incongruence increases the sense of urgency firms face (to either exploit a short-lived opportunity or mitigate a reputational threat), and thus increases the speed with which the firm introduces new products.  In addition, we show that this relationship is stronger when the firms most recently introduced product is similar to its cumulative product portfolio.  We use these findings to build on existing theory regarding both firm reputation and new product production.",reputation| product introduction| resource-based view

These effects reverse when we examine the impacts on firms financial performance.  We suggest variation in governance costs and knowledge gains explains why density increases the contribution of exploratory conversion to performance, whereas centrality reduces the benefits of exploitative conversion.",invention| innovation| networks

To form alliances, firms have to be aware of their opportunity set. This awareness can come from various sources; embeddedness in different networks are such sources. Prior alliance networks of firms and possession of technological knowledge have been shown to be important contextual factors (sources of information) which affect alliance formation rates. We posit embeddedness in technical committee networks through joint participation and embeddedness in director interlocks networks are mechanisms that allow firms to exchange information pertinent to alliance formation beyond that allowed by the contextual factors. We note that extant literature has not focused much on the influence of multiple networks on firm strategic outcomes, or on their contingent effects. Our objective in this study is twofold. Firstly, we propose to study the effects of embeddedness/participation in multiple networks on alliance formation, both as inducements and opportunities of technical alliances. Secondly, we seek to gain insight on the contingent value of participation in networks for alliance formation. Thus, our question is: what role does embeddedness in technical committee networks and director interlock networks play for firms when they have lower or higher levels of embeddedness in prior alliance networks? Similarly, what role do these networks play when the firms have lower or higher levels of technological knowledge? We propose that for firms embedded in an alliance network, participation in technical committee networks is not a very important source of information for alliance formation (Thus we are arguing for a redundancy effect of the new channel of information). Similarly for firms with significant technological knowledge, participation in technical committee networks is not a very significant source of information for alliance formation. Further, we propose that director interlocks play an important role for firms even if they possess significant technological knowledge and are embedded in an alliance network.  (Thus we are arguing a non-redundancy effect for director interlocks; implying that endorsement and influence from the top-most management level  in the organization is not substituted by any other information channel). Results from a ten year panel on the US cellular industry show that the influence of technical committee network is indeed greatest for dyads with less visible patents. The influence for dyads not embedded in an alliance network, however, is not as expected. Technical committee networks act as a complement rather than as a substitute to prior alliances. The effect of director interlocks does not depend on the context factors, as expected. Implications of the results are discussed.",network ties| alliance formation| embeddedness

Namely, whether a focal firms partners are innovative themselves and what the effects of this innovativeness on a focal firms innovative outcome might be. This study considers different types of partners such as customers and suppliers and deals with the differential impact of partners` innovativeness on a focal firms knowledge stock, absorptive capacity (ACAP), and innovation success.Drawing on literature on open innovation and ACAP and employing a survey in the manufacturing industry, we show whether a certain partner types innovativeness is linked to innovation success, knowledge stock, and ACAP of a focal firm.

Piller|RWTH Aachen U.||,,"In this study, we focus on the question why users participate in firm-initiated ideation. Building on the private-collective innovation model of von Hippel and von Krogh (2003, 2006), we ask the following questions: (1) Are the incentives proposed by the private-collective innovation model sufficient to explain user participation? (2) Do users require monetary rewards on top - following common practice of designing firm-initiated ideation as a contest with prizes for the best performing users or the most valued ideas? (3) Do these incentives have different (or even detrimental) effects on collectively oriented participation like commenting, improving or evaluating other users ideas as opposed to individually oriented idea submissions? (4) Do these conditions remain stable even in the presence of one entity (in this case the host), who predominantly governs the exploitation of freely revealed ideas (e.g. Harhoff and Mayrhofer, 2010)?  By using behavioural data from a real firm-initiated ideation activity, we find that expected monetary reward is on average the sole driver of the likelihood to submit an idea. A predominant entity that governs ideation outcome needs to introduce a monetary reward in order to induce users to reveal their ideas. However, the importance of monetary rewards is less strong for users who have a strong personal need and hence interest in the innovation outcome. On the other hand, expected monetary reward does on average not seem to induce collectively oriented participation behaviour. On the contrary, for users with strong personal needs, monetary rewards even seem to be detrimental for collective oriented participation. Given a strong interaction effect, the importance of the users private and collective benefits, is even stronger when they also perceive strong personal needs.",user innovation| incentives| idea contests

The purpose of our empirical study on innovating users regarding electric vehicles is two-folded: First of all, we want to explore whether social benefits are expected by users (or not). If that is the case, we want to gain further insights on the types of social benefits that users perceive and pursue. Our netnographic study of the online communities Electric Car Forum and Electric Bike Forum shows that expected social benefits are relevant for innovating users regarding electric vehicles, indeed. We identified a number of posts regarding expected social benefits which can be categorised as follows: 1) protection of the natural environment, 2) contributions to societal transformations, and 3) promotion of social equity. Overall, 34 out of 212 members (16%) of the online community Electric Car Forum and 53 out of 633 members (8.3%) of the online community Electric Bike Forum could be classified as innovating users.

Most of the literature views producers and users as organizationally distinct. Employing lead users is a novel mode for firms to absorb sticky need knowledge. We hypothesize that ELUs, like external lead users, are characterized by their high use expertise, technical expertise, and product involvement, and that this affects their organizational innovation-related behavior. We test these hypotheses using survey data (N=149) from the mountaineering equipment industry. We find that, compared to other employees, ELUs are significantly more active in understanding customer problems, in creating novel products and solutions to meet customers needs, and in boundary spanning across firm functions in the innovation process. These findings are robust to the inclusion of job satisfaction and differences in functional roles. We extensively discuss directions for future research on this novel phenomenon.

Our results show that, the more the threat of substitution is deduced from media discourse, the more the firms decelerate their rate of entry into the emerging product market. However, in spite of an increase in media discourse espousing the threat of substitution, firms with more technological capabilities related to the market did not decelerate. Firms with more market entry momentum and those whose existing rivals have entered the market in large numbers even accelerated. Thus, we find that firms vary systematically in their response to the perceived threat deduced from media discourse.Paper is No Longer Available Online: Please contact the author(s).Management innovation is speculated to be an enabler of technological change by way of adoption or development of new technologies.

In particular, patents and alliances have been shown to be positively related to a start-ups ability to attract venture capital financing. The role of start-up resources in this context is two-fold, they can have a productive and a signaling function. Patents, for instance, first carry value in their original function as property rights; and second, they can serve as signals for the unobservable quality of a ventures technology. Existing studies in this field are based on firm-level transaction data, which does not allow to disentangle the signaling effect of start-up resources from their productive effect. We address this gap by means of a conjoint-based survey among 102 European VCs. It turns out that VCs mainly rely on the existence of research alliances as indicators of technological quality. Patents appear to have a strong impact on VC decision making, too, but only in their property rights function and not as quality signals.",patents| venture capital| signaling

Both early and later stage VC investment tends to have no impact on the growth of patent applications. Early stage VC investment, however, has a negative impact on short-term TFP growth.

This positive effect of information access needs to be balanced with correlated risk concerns in the portfolio. We test this model for more than 7,000 German firm observations, their main banks client portfolio and their R&D expenditures over a six year period. The theoretical predictions are supported.

The empirical results indicate that the effect of press reports is stronger than the effect of actual corporate performance on public perceptions of companies over time, as measured by corporate rankings in the annual Recruit Survey. This suggests that institutions, such as the press, shape public perceptions of corporations more than does actual corporate performance.

The emergent grounded model indicated that it was the co-evolution of organizational- and field-level identities that rendered the identity formation process at the field-level a sequential, albeit non-linear and complex, process  one that is continuously precarious and ultimately turns on the resolution of a macro-level identity crisis. The dynamic and recursive relationships among the processes involved in the identity formation at the organization- and field-levels precipitated this crisis, which threatened to stymie the emergence of the field.

The business unit has superior information about licensing opportunities but may not have the appropriate incentives because its rewards depend upon product market performance. If licensing is decentralized, the business unit forgoes valuable licensing opportunities since the rewards for licensing are (optimally) weaker than those for product market profits. This distortion is stronger when production-based incentives are more powerful, making centralization more attractive.

Drawing on the resource-based view (RBV), we hypothesize and find that an increase in the value of IP significantly increases the likelihood that the IP is offered for licensing through a patent pool, while an increase in the imitability of IP significantly decreases the likelihood that the IP is offered for licensing. Further, we find differential effects for the intrinsic and extrinsic dimensions of value and imitability on the likelihood of IP licensing. Extrinsic imitability of IP negatively moderates the relationship between the value of IP and the likelihood it is offered for licensing through a pool, whereas intrinsic imitability positively moderates this relationship.

Barton|Boston U.||,,"This study addresses a paradox faced by new technology ventures. To survive in uncertain and dynamic environments, organizations must adjust their operations and strategies to align with changing knowledge and environmental conditions. Yet realignment can be costly in terms of disrupted operations, resources, and timelines  threatening the success of new ventures. Thus, we need to go beyond recognizing the capabilities underlying flexible alignment to explicating efficient alignment. In this study, I suggest that efficiency of realignment is contingent upon entrepreneurs ability to notice misalignment and to reduce the equivocality of experience. Using a survey of 139 technology entrepreneurs, I test a model of organizational practices that facilitate efficient response to uncertainty. My findings suggest when ventures are vigilant about performance monitoring they undergo smaller, more incremental realignment efforts. In addition, when ventures use experiential diagnostics to create unequivocal data, they experience less disruption from organizational change. Finally, my data suggest that better performance is associated with smaller and less disruptive change, but the effects of the size of change are fully mediated by disruption from change. Thus, it is change efficiency rather than lack of change per se that seems to facilitate new venture performance. By reframing the challenge of uncertainty in the entrepreneurial process to focus on efficiency of realignment efforts, this study offers a new perspective on change within the entrepreneurship literature. It also contributes to broader discussions of organizational uncertainty by considering the rarely addressed challenges inherent in interpreting and ascribing meaning to equivocal experience.",uncertainty| entrepreneurship| technology

Complementing such predominant actor-level viewpoint, we examine under what conditions the pursuit of network advantage by central actors contributes to, or detracts from, the innovative performance of the firm as a whole. We argue that the extent to which the benefits of centrally connected individuals spill over to the firm depends on the distribution of network centrality within the network and on the type of knowledge exchanges. We test our predictions by examining the internal networks of 141 semiconductor firms, and the position of individual inventors therein, between 1986 and 2003. Bringing new insights on the trade-off between individual and collective outcomes within organizations, we find that the same network structures enhancing the innovativeness of central inventors often reduce the firm-level ability to come out with impactful innovations.",intra-organizational networks| centrality| innovation

Our data analysis demonstrates that the collaboration networks at the beginning were characterized by a set of unconnected bits and pieces of isolated individuals and small teams. In Samsung, isolated teams were gradually connected to one another by the company's effort to build bridges between different subunits, such as job rotations and cross-functional meetings. In the 1990s and afterwards, the company saw an emergence of a giant cluster with a small proportion of bridging ties that interweave small- and medium-sized subgroups that were previously unconnected. Benchmarking Samsung's practices with some time lag, Hynix experienced the rise of a similar giant cluster in the new millennium.

Building on social cognitive theory and social dominance theory, this study argues and empirically demonstrates that SDO is positively linked to unethical decision making by means of morally disengaging rationalizations. Showing a greater endorsement of power and status inequalities, supporting the division of responsibilities, and believing that they are superior to others, socially dominant individuals are more likely to resort to morally disengaging rationalizations which help minimize accountability, responsibility, and self-sanctions, and ultimately get involved in unethical decision making. However, the study also shows that an individual ability to self-control moderates the positive relationship between SDO, moral disengagement, and unethical decision making. Socially dominant individuals with greater levels of self-control are less likely to use moral disengagement mechanisms and get involved in unethical decisions because they tend to exhibit greater awareness of self and others and have a greater ability to exercise control over their actions to bring them in line with preferred standards. Practitioners and educators understanding these processes are better equipped to design organizational systems and training programs to curtail unethical decision making.",social dominance orientation| unethical decision making| self-control

However, far less is known about what factors influence the evaluation of such ethical behaviors by observers.  Managers and organizational leaders need to monitor the often ambiguous behavior of employees to determine whether it is ethically appropriate. Doing so requires that they accurately infer the intentions underlying a given behavior in the workplace. In this paper, we propose one novel factor that influences the assessment of an actors intentions: the speed at which recorded behavior is observed.  In three studies, we demonstrate that slowing down the playback speed of actions leads them to be evaluated as more intentional than their regular speed counterparts.  This pattern holds for evaluators who are shown both video speeds; is evidenced across multiple constructs for measuring judgments of intentionality (e.g., how hard one is trying and how much control one has over the action); and extends to judgments of how much blame and punishment the actor deserves.

Under this assumption, the amount of external knowledge the focal firm can capture increases with its absorptive capacity investments. However, this linear relation may not hold when the spillover pool is endogenously determined by those investments. We address this issue by investigating how incumbent firms absorptive capacity affects their learning from new entrants, which bring innovative ideas into the industry. While incumbents investments increase their learning ability, particularly when entrants locate in the same product market incumbents operate, they also create expropriation and competition concerns for the entrants. In response, entrants may choose to enter different product markets. This impairs incumbents ability to capture entrants knowledge, since market overlap (i.e., the extent to which firms operate simultaneously in at least one product market) is necessary for incumbents to be aware of new entrants knowledge and to understand its applicability. Thus, high investment levels in absorptive capacity, which may be beneficial in a static environment, can be less effective in the long run when entrants can apply novel knowledge in different product markets.

It is then interesting to study how a rejected entity can redefine its identity and raise questions about the representativeness of the current spokesman. In order to do this, we study the pornographic cinema industry, which was initially excluded from the network that supported the Blu-Ray solution during the war over high definition DVD standards between Blu-Ray and HD-DVD solutions.

The problematic nature of innovation can lead to strong negative expectations about the outcomes of innovation that can act as a !(r)self-fulfilling prophecy!- further reducing the probability of innovation.

A debate opposes those who believe that this results from the more fundamental aspect of academic research and those who argue that specific elements of the university environment hinder the dissemination of science. This paper advances the debate by focusing on simultaneous discoveries. When two teams of scientists make the same discovery around the same time, two papers can be published disclosing essentially the same new knowledge. I exploit the fact that some of these paper twins emerge on both sides of the academia-industry boundary. The knowledge associated with the discovery can therefore diffuse simultaneously within the two distinct institutional environments. Analysis of 720 paper twins, 49 of them located across the university-industry boundary, confirms that discoveries made in academia have a lower technological impact as measured through the citation-weighted count of patents referring to university papers. In line with the argument that academic knowledge is trapped inside the ivory tower, this difference remains significant after the introduction of discovery-level fixed-effects.

We also find the amount of trust between partners to be strongly associated with project timeliness, collaboration satisfaction, and continuity motivations, but not with learning in UI partnering.

The empirical results suggest that firms tend to balance their internal exploration (exploitation) in R&D with external exploitation (exploration) taking place in their alliances. These findings are observed irrespective of the domain used for defining exploration-exploitation in the firms alliances. Finally, the results show that a balance of exploration and exploitation across firms boundaries has positive effects on innovative performance.

We propose that transformational and transactional leader behaviors of top level management are likely to have a positive impact on business model innovation by developing learning activity of the subject and by instructing the development of new forms of activity, such as a new business model of the incumbent firm as the learning subject. We also propose that transactional and transformational leader behaviors mediate the positive impact of instrumental leader behavior on business model innovation. From our model, we propose that laissez-faire leader behavior of a firms top management is negatively associated with business model innovation of incumbent firms.",leader behavior| business model innovation| organizational learning

In this paper, we examine whether and to what extent spatial ambidexterity affects the technological performance of firms. Spatial ambidexterity reflects the degree to which exploration and exploitation are pursued in the same or in different locations. Drawing on a panel dataset of 172 large R&D intensive firms situated within five industries (non-electrical machinery, pharmaceuticals & biotechnology, chemicals, IT hardware, and electronics & electrical machinery) and examining global technology development activities at the regional level, our findings reveal that collocating exploration and exploitation results in a higher technological performance compared to spatially separation.

Agglomeration, by eliminating the physical space between people, firms and ideas, affects not only the rate of innovation, but also the type of idea recombinations that take place. While the role of co-location on innovation has been extensively studied, the micro-foundations of knowledge transfer and generation still remain undeveloped. Co-location, by increasing the frequency of interactions with very low expected value, qualitatively transforms the knowledge that is recombined, allowing for high levels of ""exploration"". This is particularly important when the uncertainty surrounding idea quality is high (e.g. early-stage research) and the outcome distribution is very skewed (e.g. scientific breakthroughs). I analyze how geographic proximity impacts the recombination of ideas using a novel dataset of department relocations at the University of Toronto (1995-2010). Collaborations across departments pairs are compared before and after co-location, a change that disproportionately affects low expected value interactions. Results are consistent with the idea that proximity has a profound influence both on the rate and the direction of innovative activity.",geographic proximity| knowledge flows| idea recombination

It is hypothesized and found that those (non naive, but certainly not omniscient) decision makers under uncertainty are able to employ a variety of effective and logically sound heuristics, rather than a congeries of biasing heuristics, on augmented rather than reduced cognitive effort. These complex heuristics are specified and operationalized in the study and results indicate that the wider their application, especially in combination, the lower the likelihood of error. This work then contributes to decision making theory by singling out and showing evidence of decision strategies that, in the course of being heuristic, reduce rather than increase error rates. Secondly, it contributes to decision making practice as investors in that field are often unaware of the logic they use, and even more of what may be considered ineffective or effective decision heuristics.",innovation heuristics| cognitive complexitiy| entrepreneurship

To fill this gap, this article reports an experimental examination of the role of mentally simulating alternative futures in alleviating the effects of persistence by stimulating strategic reorientation  shifts in patterns of strategic decision behavior. Using a complex business simulation, we demonstrate that undertaking multiple scenario analysis prior to radical change in the organizational task environment leads to increased strategic reorientation following the change. The findings suggest that compared to other forms of intervention, the self-generation of alternative scenarios, a technique associated with high levels of mental simulation, appears particularly adept at facilitating strategic reorientation.

Based on the patent data from SIPO and regional level data of five regions concentrated with ICT industrial clusters in China, dynamic panel regression using difference GMM is adopted to test the hypotheses. The results show that the knowledge centrality of a given technology in the focal region has negative impact on focal RTS and this relationship is not affected by the development of local technology market. Instead, the knowledge centrality of the technology in other ICT regions, on average, has negligible effect on focal RTS but this relationship highly depends on the development of technology market in the other regions.

Despite the recognition that perceptions of organizational justice are socially constructed very little research has considered the role of the organizational context in shaping why justice matters or what members view to constitute fair treatment.  We believe organizational identity is a prime contextual variable likely to profoundly mold employees perceptions of justice.  Specifically, within the domain of organizational identity, the construct of organizational identity orientation is apt to be particularly consequential in influencing employees perceptions of justice because it deeply shapes their understandings and expectations of the organization in terms of what is legitimate and important for it to do and to be.  The current paper applies this organizational identity framework to predict why organizations and their members are concerned about maintaining systems of justice as well as what members consider to be fair.  We argue that each organization identity orientation (individualistic, relational, collectivistic) corresponds with a distinct justice motivation, which in turn influences employees perceptions of fairness.",organizational justice| organizational identity| social construction

Using theory related to bureaucratic control, we argue the push to spread autonomy is coinciding with some unintended effects as organizations pull back and fight the urge to relinquish control to employees.  We argue that employees are sensitive to this tension in the organization, which changes how they experience felt responsibility.  What was once just a source of motivation, autonomy has now become a source of guilt and stress, leading to role boundary management challenges.

Knowledge integration has been studied at the industry, organizational and team levels, however, surprisingly little attention has been devoted to the individual level and the specific skills and activities that individuals need to master to successfully participate in knowledge-integration processes. This paper focuses on one kind of knowledge-integration setting  a setting that is becoming increasingly common in a wide range of industries and sectors  namely project-based work involving the collaboration among relative strangers. This setting is particularly interesting since much research has documented the importance of familiarity among participants to foster knowledge integration. The context addressed in this paper is instead one of limited familiarity and cool and rapid socialization, which challenges much conventional thinking about knowledge integration. The core argument developed is that knowledge integration depends on the individuals abilities to participate in knowledge-integration processes, and, accordingly, the individuals behavior and skills are central to the analysis and efficiency of such processes. Based on an in-depth study of mobile engineers employed by one of Scandinavias leading technical consultancies, this paper identifies and theoretically positions five activities that are critical for knowledge integration at work; rule-following, relating, role carving, reflection, and reframing.

R&D is the primary engine of innovation. Undeniably, however, imitation is more abundant than innovation in firms product and process development. Accordingly, the probing question must be: what is the engine of imitation? I argue that imitation is a major R&D activity; the innovation engine requires the spark of R&D and imitation to ignite. Upon validation, a fundamental question emerges: how does imitation activity influence innovation output within the firm? My research argues that two dynamics govern the imitation-innovation relationship: substitutability, where firms imitation activity reduces their innovation output within a given period; and complementarity, where firms imitation activity increases future innovation output. I test these hypotheses empirically following cross-sectional and longitudinal designs on 227 public firms in the computer, semiconductor, and pharmaceutical industries in the U.S. during 1991-2010. The results reveal that imitation is indeed a major R&D activity that competes with innovation for R&D investments. Imitation leads to future innovation gains but in a non-linear fashion; excessive levels of imitation activity deteriorate future innovation output.

We also propose that investors experience and aspects of firms innovation strategy, which enhance investors ability to identify and profit from opportunities that arise under uncertainty, will exacerbate this relationship. A longitudinal examination of more than 25,000 investments in medical innovation firms made between 1993 and 2006 offers support for these arguments. Somewhat paradoxically, we find that higher levels of agreement among securities analysts can hinder firms efforts to attract investors.

Results show that evaluators viewed the low novelty idea as more creative than creators, while creators viewed the high novelty idea as more creative than evaluators.  Experiment 2 demonstrated this pattern of results when both roles were accountable for creativity; uncertainty whether the idea had value explained why each role shifted their categorization of the idea as creative.  These findings partially explain why organizations often desire but reject creative ideas, and expand the theory of how creative ideas are recognized.",creativity| role theory| innovation

However, two perspectives are conflicting directly on the incompatible or complementary logics of exploratory and exploitative innovation and how to integrate them for superior firm performance. From the disruptive innovation perspective, this study contributes to resolving this debating by distinguishing innovation ambidexterity into the technological dimension and the market dimension. We investigate the effects of technological exploration, technological exploitation and their interaction on firm performance under proactive market orientation and responsive market orientation. Six hypotheses are proposed and tested with data from 203 firms. Our results show that technological exploration has a positive effect on firm performance under proactive market orientation but an inverted U-shaped effect under responsive market orientation; and that technological exploitation has an insignificant effect on firm performance under proactive market orientation but a positive effect under responsive market orientation. Furthermore, we find that the interaction of technological exploration and technological exploitation has a positive effect on firm performance under proactive market orientation but a negative effect under responsive market orientation. Our research contributes to resolving the incompatible or complementary debating and also adds to innovation ambidexterity by examining the moderating effects of market orientation as an important organizational context.",ambidexterity| technological innovation| market orientation

With Gillette, a company was chosen that is known for its superior IP strategy. The case focuses on the patents applied for the Gillette Fusion razor. Three levels of interlocking activities are identified: First, Gillette filed patent claims following a hierarchical structure, claiming different (partially modular) components of a razor simultaneously. Second, it made use of continuation and divisional applications, splitting up patent applications into different, partially overlapping filings. Third, certain technological concepts were claimed in multiple patent families. In general, the degree of technological coupling of components influences the creation of interlocking patents, as well as the business model involved. The results contribute to the literature on patent clusters, including patent fences and patent thickets, but also the field of modularity.

We propose a new methodology  topic modeling of patent texts  to distinguish cognitive from economic breakthroughs.

Using a social network approach, we extend the conceptualization of social capital by including the preferences of actors to develop new relationships, and strengthen or weaken existing ones. Preferences might include the goals of increasing ones centrality, creating structural holes, and improving ones reputation (via connections to high status others).  When considering preferences, we ask the question, do certain individuals utilize various strategies related to social capital theory?  To identify preferences, we analyze the actual work communication network of employees in a global high technology company (n = 68) as well as each respondents preferred network (i.e., ties that respondents feel would improve their work performance).  Controlling for gender, tenure, and existing network position, we find that top performers (as determined by performance evaluations) are more likely than others to prefer increased structural social capital via increased centrality and increased brokerage opportunities.  We also find that top performers are more likely than others to prefer improved relationships with high status alters.

Study 2 showed that women who were perceived to adhere to stereotypical female social network roles were seen as warm, whereas women perceived to violate stereotypical female roles were seen as competent. To the extent that biased perceptions of womens roles in the social network were shared by group members, both individual and team performance was affected. Specifically, although womens individual performance was bolstered by perceptions that they played active, agentic roles in the friendship network, these perceptions caused a decrement to team performance.

Two experimental studies, which involve 158 executives in a large health care organization and 129 employees in smaller establishments, help assess the relative contributions of threat-rigidity, reactance, and loss aversion in steering network activation under uncertainty.  Neither study supports the predictions of threat-rigidity theory.  Both studies suggest conditional support for reactance theory:  the tendency to activate more ties under constraint (rather than agency) was moderated by an individuals internal locus of control.  Loss aversions predictions are mostly supported:  uncertainty associated with loss (rather than gain) led people in both studies to activate more ties and, in Study 1, to activate a greater proportion of organizationally distant ties.  The article also integrates insights from cognitive psychology, which shows that people recall different network contacts in response to situational primes, and pragmatist and phenomenological perspectives on human agency, which suggest that practical evaluation of uncertain events is an inherently deliberative act.  Together, the two studies provide insight into these alternative perspectives and advance our understanding of the interrelationships between cognition and social networks.",social capital| cognition| networks

To overcome the above problem, I propose an alternative Eastern philosophy of wisdom as a counterbalance to the Western philosophy of science toward a cross-fertilizing integration between the West and the East at the most fundamental level. In particular, the Eastern epistemological frame of Yin-Yang Balancing enjoys the unique potential to reframe ambiguity from a negative problem (inconsistency) to a positive solution (completeness). Building upon the Eastern philosophy of wisdom, I propose an Eastern paradigm of creative cognition from complexity (rooted in the ontology of Tao) first to ambiguity (rooted in the epistemology of Yin-Yang Balancing) and then to metaphor (rooted in the methodology of Wu as intuitive imagination). This Eastern paradigm can incorporate the Western research on creativity into the geocentric meta-paradigm of creative cognition. The tentative sketches of the Eastern philosophy of wisdom and the geocentric meta-paradigm of creative cognition are the contributions of this study. The central theme of this research is that the Eastern philosophy of wisdom is primarily concerned with the creation of novel knowledge as exploration in problem solving and decision making, while the Western philosophy of science is concerned with the evaluation of such knowledge as exploitation.",indigenous research| intuition| wisdom

Drawing on the reputation literature and signaling theory, this paper empirically tests whether firms increase their use of patents prior to IPO date, and whether these patents are underutilized because they are used primarily to signal innovativeness to investors rather than to capture rents.  Using data from the NBER database on 464 patents granted in the drug and medicine industry, results show that there is a significant relationship between an increase in patenting activities and the IPO date of a firm. In addition, as expected, many of these patents expire, reinforcing the notion that these patents serve as IPO signals of reputational advantage.",patents| signals| reputation

To do so, we take a behavioral approach by considering the potential biases of inventors stemming from both their history of success and the aspirations of their employers, and the extent to which legal counsel can curb the effects of such biases. We analyze patents granted to solo authored inventions between the years of 2001 and 2006. We find that the failure to reveal relevant and knowable prior art is greater for inventors who have been highly successful in the past and are employed by profit seeking organizations, especially those that are underperforming. These effects are particularly strong when outside legal counsel is used by firms to guide the patenting process. We suggest that inventors have greater discretion to act on their biases and be influenced by the aspirations of their employers when legal counsel is less aware of the specific prior art and technological domains that the inventors are building on.Paper is No Longer Available Online: Please contact the author(s).We investigate to what extent patent law firms that work as contracted service agents for different clients facilitate knowledge spillovers among their clientele.

There are five stages to the phenomena of academic entrepreneurship conceptualized in the model: motivation, selection, governance, competition and knowledge spillover. Theoretical perspectives of each stage that are discussed in the article draw upon resource dependence theory, agency theory, transaction costs economics, and resource and knowledge based views.

Our results offer insights into the roles that students and faculty can play in the technology commercialization process, the different relationships between students, faculty, and entrepreneurs that can lead to successful spin-off creation, and the relative strengths and weaknesses of each arrangement.  We also provide insights into the broad range of institutional mechanisms that universities adopt to facilitate the different pathways.",technology transfer| effectuation theory

In contrast to most studies that focused on facilitators support, this study tries to uncover how these support activities help to overcome critical junctures that constrain growth of academic spin-offs over time. We build upon the life cycle and the evolutionary perspective on spin-offs considering the barriers in different growth stages. This paper analyses facilitators support at all four technical universities in the Netherlands, following 20 in-depth interviews. We derive that in different growth stages spin-off needs different priorities in support activities to overcome growth junctures. For example, the early growth juncture opportunity recognition may be facilitated best by business support, such as connecting spin-off to business people.",academic spin-off| critical junctures| facilitator support

However, the influence of component value as a very important characteristic has hardly been examined. This is despite the fact, that the value criterion allows investigations into the trajectories of successful innovations and their evolutionary nature - a central concern of research in innovation, science and social progress. This paper provides an empirical analysis of the relationship between component value and innovation performance. It uses evolutionary theory to argue, that component value is curvilinear related to innovation value and that this is particularly true for breakthrough innovations. The analysis of more than 170,000 patented innovations across various industries supports these claims. It shows that the value of components have a positive impact on innovation performance, but only up to a certain point. High levels of component value reduce the innovation value and this is particularly true for old components and breakthrough innovations. The findings illustrate that an increase in valuable inputs not always lead to more valuable outputs and even can be harmful.",innovation| patent| evolutionary theory

As organizations strive to transfer and reuse knowledge across time and space, they have to deal with two opposing forces: while the advantages of replication push for reproducing exactly tangible and intangible assets, capabilities and resources that embed organizational knowledge, exogenous changes impose forms of adaptation of those assets, capabilities and resources to changing external conditions. This qualitative study analyzes two large firms that have been dealing with replication and adaptation for decades relatively to the provision of ICT products and services. The research relied on qualitative data collected and analyzed reiteratively through constant comparison methods at multiple levels (firm, unit, product, and project) over a time span of three years (2007-2010). Findings show that both firms treat replication and adaptation as mutually reinforcing and complementary rather than opposed and contradictory. To do so, they build and maintain complex systems of interdependent knowledge assets that are replicated and adapted selectively, depending on the characteristics of the underlying knowledge. The new concept of adaptive replication is then introduced to explain the close interplay between replication and adaptation of knowledge.",replication| adaptation| knowledge transfer

Firms that are able to develop such a capability have a better chance to succeed in competition. Traditional academic models of innovation usually focus their efforts in one single special capability, the technological capability. However, emerging theoretical schools of thought consider innovation  as a capability of higher order, formed by a set of specific abilities found in any firm: technological, operational, managerial, and transactional. The aim of this paper is to present an application of this innovation capability model by examining some cases of the southern Brazilian footwear industry The firms in this industry direct investment more to operational capability than to technological capability and, in some cases, it is possible to observe firms that have kept themselves active and competitive by showing innovative outcomes. For the purpose of this research, a multiple case-study in the footwear industry was conducted in four firms located in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. The main results are as follow: (1) All firms always have different levels in the four capabilities; (2) one of the capabilities is usually dominant over the others; (3) companies have presented a common behavior, characterized by proactively seeking new markets and own-brands; (4) the changes result in innovative outcomes that have much more of a transactional nature than technological. This suggests that the major driver of the innovation capability is no longer operations nor technological development, but the transactional capability of the firm.Paper is No Longer Available Online: Please contact the author(s).Despite extensive research in the fields of economics and the management of innovation over the past thirty years, the sources of demand-pull innovations have yet to be empirically validated.

Proper implementation of integration between firm departments is crucial  particularly in highly innovative environments facing high levels of uncertainty. Little research exists on the effects of close interaction and collaboration of the sales department in development activities. To start closing this gap, we use partly dyadic survey data from 304 companies to examine the performance effects of close sales-marketing, sales-R&D, and sales-finance integration in new product development. Furthermore, moderating effects of market-based and technology-based innovativeness, representing high levels of uncertainty, are analyzed. The results reflect the significant performance contribution of high integration levels between sales and marketing, R&D, and finance. While high levels of market-based and technology-based innovativeness both strengthen this relationship for the integration of sales and marketing as well as sales and R&D, they negatively moderate the performance effect of close sales-finance integration. Thus, cross-functional integration of the sales department is crucial for successful new product development, but not between all functional departments and by all means.",sales department| cross-functional integration| new product development

However, deploying financial slack to pursue explorative and exploitative innovation activities requires a control mechanism to monitor and mitigate managerial risk-taking and protect the interest of minority shareholders. We therefore posit that the relationship between financial slack and different types of innovation behavior may be moderated by the control mechanisms that are imposed on the managers.We extend this argument in the context of Taiwan to investigate how different characteristics of board composition influence the relationship between financial slack and the intensity of explorative and exploitative innovation activities. The longitudinal dataset used in this study is composed of the Taiwanese electronic companies which were publicly listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange from year 2000 to 2008. Empirical evidence shows that financial slack has a positive and significant direct effect on both explorative and exploitative innovation. Moreover, in line with stewardship theory, insider board members positively moderates the relationship between financial slack and explorative innovation, but negatively on exploitative innovation, and this moderation effect is stronger than for executive directors. In contrast, and contrary to the prediction of agency theory, our results show that outsider board members comprising of either individual or institutional directors negatively moderates the relationship between financial slack and explorative innovation, and this negative influence is stronger with individual than institutional directors. We argue that these differences result from information asymmetry and the variations in motives and incentives for insider and outsider directors. The results of our empirical analyses on Taiwanese electronics companies extend the prior literature on the antecedents of innovation behavior by showing the contingent effect of board composition.",financial slack| board composition| explorative and exploitative

Focusing on the short-run decision of whether to allocate production output to downstream plants within the same firm or to external customers, we find that customer-focused IT, by itself, has surprisingly little impact. In contrast, adoption of upstream supplier-focused IT at a plant is associated with a significant decline in downstream vertical integration. However, the greatest decline in within-firm transfers occurs when supplier- and customer-facing IT are adopted together, suggesting the presence of complementarities in supply chain technology adoption. These results are consistent with the view that, by reducing external coordination costs, IT investments promote a decline in plant-level vertical integration, but only when those investments are made jointly with both suppliers and customers. Our results provide less support for the view that IT investments led to a decline in vertical integration by lowering transactions risks.",information technology| firm boundary| supply chain

The framework provides guidance as how to manage data flows between stakeholders, offering insight into each of their specific data requirements.

Negative attitudes against the utilization of external knowledge (i.e. the Not-invented-here (NIH) syndrome), as well as against the external exploitation of knowledge assets (i.e. the Not-shared-here (NSH) syndrome), are posited to create resistance against these activities and, consequently, this suggest a misalignment between the intentions of top management and the behaviour of involved employees. This paper empirically assesses the theoretical assertion that the NIH and NSH syndromes have separate negative impacts on the adoption of respectively the inbound and the outbound approaches to open innovation. Furthermore, the paper suggests that the effect of these attitudes can be diminished with the implementation of competence building programmes focused on training of employees. Three sets of hypotheses are tested related to the consequences and moderators of the NIH- and NSH-syndromes with cross-sectional survey data from small and medium sized Danish manufacturing firms.

Decentralization leads to the exploration of a wide range of technological paths. As such, it may influence the invention value distribution in two distinct ways. The first mechanism is related to a stochastic parallel path effect, which increases the value of the best inventions but decreases the value of the worst ones. The second mechanism refers to complementarities between distinct R&D paths, which asymmetrically increases the value of all inventions, such that the gains are highest for low-quality inventions. Estimation accounts for potential biases due to the endogeneity of regional R&D decentralization, and shows that decentralization affects the distribution of returns from inventive activity mainly through a complementarity mechanism.",r&d decentralization| invention value distribution| instrumental variables

This paper aims to map an emerging disruptive change; that of mobile VOIP and to evaluate the role of inter-organizational networks in the emergence of this disruptive change. By delineating the steps required in a mobile VOIP call and describing the influences along this supply chain, the paper shows 4 stages in the supply chain that are typified by the traditional variables affecting technological change; competing standards; emergence of a dominant platform standard; the role of incumbent firms and emerging firms and the role of inter-organizational networks. Traditional thinking states that inter-organizational networks facilitate technological development; in this paper by delineating each stage in the supply chain, the role of inter-organizational networks is mapped; at some points, these networks have facilitated technological development but at the critical point of commercialization, what appears to be collective action by incumbent firms hinders the widespread adoption of the disruptive technology.",disruptive change|| telecommunications| networks|

Effects of consortium embeddedness are tested for different types of repeated collaboration, by examining the founding of 1653 R&D-projects during an observation period of 23 years. Results show that embeddedness stimulates the likelihood of repeated collaboration, and provides the network a stable core, particularly when external ties are shaped by multiple consortium members. Furthermore, the orientation of the stable core is prone to the type of external ties of the consortium. Finally, embeddedness effects are temporal dynamic: embeddedness advantages increase when the collaboration matures over time, until the project ends. Accordingly, this study demonstrates the importance of a dynamic perspective on embeddedness in order to reveal how a stable core of repeatedly collaborating actors develops in inter-organizational networks.",consortia| collaboration| dynamics

Malik|Dongbei U. of Finance and Economics||,,"The high-technology technology company is increasingly developing its technological advantages in foreign countries. For instance, China is one of the favored destinations for the global clinical trial activity in search of new products. The nature of the organization of such activities is debated whether innovation should be inside or outside the company. This article develops and tests the argument that technological complexity in clinical trials influences inter-firm collaborative structure of foreign firms in China. We propose a positive link between technological complexity and joint activities. It is contrary to the perceived view that complexity leads to the internalization of an innovation activity. We also suggest that the joint structure becomes more complex when there are more agents in the collaborative activity. This study tests the link between technological activity and structural complexity on four measures of complexity in the clinical trial. The evidence supports the positive link between technological complexity and collaborative ventures between foreign firms for innovation in China. Thus, there is support for contingency and open-rational system, hence open-contingency perspective. We discuss theoretical and practical implications for multiple perspectives.Paper is No Longer Available Online: Please contact the author(s).",

The extended model, dubbed Consumer Acceptance and Readiness for Technology (CART), considers the relationships between cognitive and affective constructs of the CAT model and the construct of technology readiness in a fully mediated framework. In addressing a gap in the literature, CART for the first time simultaneously combines cognition, emotion and technology readiness. By means of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), the results showed significant relationships between the constructs assessed, indicating that CART is able to explain 42% more of the variance observed in the attitude towards adoption of new technologies than CAT and that consumers' cognitive and affective evaluations of new technologies are significantly influenced by their technology readiness. Based on the significant improvement achieved in relation to existing models, the inclusion of technology readiness together with cognitive and affective constructs in technology acceptance models is recommended.",diffusion of innovations| technology acceptance| technology readiness

We study the adoption cycle of outsourcing 64 public services in local government organizations in the United States with longitudinal panel data from 1982 to 2007. Results suggest that (1) de-adoption and re-adoption decisions commonly occur, (2) the role of innovation social status is more pronounced on the adoption decision, but is mitigated by innovation costs for the de-adoption decision, (3) the influence of transaction costs differ on adoption and de-adoption such that while initial costs affects adoption, operational costs affects de-adoption, and (4) transaction costs temper the influence of social status on adoption and de-adoption, but not on re-adoption.

While there is general agreement that such deployment policies have been very effective in bringing technologies to the market, it is less understood how these policies affect technological innovation. To shed more light on this important question, we conducted comparative case studies with a global sample of 9 firms producing solar photovoltaic (PV) modules, complemented by in-depth interviews with 16 leading PV industry experts. We propose that, on the one hand, policy-induced market growth serves as an important catalyst for innovative activity as it raises the absolute level of firm investments in technological exploration. On the other hand, however, strong market growth creates an incentive for firms pursuing more mature technologies to concentrate on technological exploitation. Firms focusing on less mature technologies cannot tap the potentials of exploitative learning to the same extent as those with more mature technologies. Therefore, stimulating strong market growth raises the barrier to market entry for less mature technologies. We conclude that, when designing deployment policies, great care should be taken to avoid excess market growth so as to a) not induce strong exploitative behavior of firms and b) reduce the likelihood of a premature lock-in into more established technologies.",technological innovation| deployment policy| exploration| exploitation

From our study of 723 firms in the IT Industry, we derive positive and negative effects by coopetition on breakthrough, radical, and incremental innovation. Generally, we find that coopetition improves breakthrough innovation and radical innovation. Technological uncertainty decreases the effect of coopetition on incremental innovation. We further consider interrelation intensity as a strategy to cope with pressures of innovation coopetition under technological uncertainty. If firms face high uncertainty and install high interrelation intensity, they are able to improve radical innovation but reduce incremental innovations. Interestingly, greater innovation in terms of breakthrough, radical, and incremental innovations can be achieved by firms which withstand the application of high interrelation intensity.",coopetition| innovation| resource dependence

We adopt a competition-based view of technological uncertainty to identify an opposite effect: sometimes the firm may instead become more specialized when faced with greater technological uncertainty, so as to focus on advancing its technologies against competition and influence the resolution of uncertainty in its favor over rivals. We propose that this effect is accentuated when the firm expects it cannot easily adapt to rivals technologies subsequently, specifically when rivals are more deterrent through being litigious or innovative. Using a U.S. government funding policy for fuel cell research to create a natural experiment, with stock option implied volatilities to measure expected uncertainty, we find empirical support for our propositions among firms active in R&D for the U.S. communications equipment industry. Through these findings, we demonstrate that a competition-based view of uncertainty identifies an alternate path for the firms resource accumulation under uncertainty, and stress that resolution of uncertainty can be something the firm attempts to influence rather than to adapt to.",technological uncertainty| technological specialization| competition

Our findings suggest that cost leaders should use legal protection methods and ensure the enforcement of these methods. Differentiators should keep their knowledge and technology secret so as to mitigate the imitation enabling effect of technical intellectual property rights (IPR).

Analysis of data from the Indian biopharmaceutical sector, over the period 1996-2009, shows that greater network centrality promotes innovativeness in an ESA network, but not in an LSA network. Conversely, we find that greater structural-holes bridging has a positive effect on innovativeness in an LSA network, but not in an ESA network. Besides these contingency effects, our analysis additionally reveals a complementarity effect of centrality and structural holes on firms innovation output.

In this paper, we argue that prior literature has largely ignored the institutional context that provides or denies access to external knowledge at the country level. Combining institutional and knowledge search theory, we suggest that the market orientation of the institutional environment and the magnitude of institutional change influence when firms begin to experience the negative performance effects of oversearch. Based on a comprehensive sample of almost 8,000 firms from ten European countries, we find that institutions matter considerably for firms search activity. Higher market orientation of institutions increases the effectiveness of firms search for external knowledge while higher magnitudes of institutional change decrease it.

The results provide substantial evidence for gender differences in the prediction of specialists working (over)time. Among women specialists, parenthood had no total (direct and/or indirect) effect on their working (over)time, but support for work-life balance and high levels of career identity were importantly related to working time, including overtime.

Unfortunately, up until so far our understanding of these micro-foundations of organizational adaptation has been limited. We argue that relational embeddedness, through the influence it has on organizational member goal alignment and balanced knowledge acquisition, is a strong means for explorative activities. Here, the balanced conceptualization of knowledge acquisition stresses the notion that knowledge is a whole, simultaneously composed of a tacit and an explicit dimension of which the on is not reducible to the other. In doing so we address the conceptual and empirical divide within the literature on relational embeddedness. We find that the effect through goal alignment negatively affects explorative activities. In contrast, the effect through balanced knowledge acquisition positively relates to organizational members exploration activities. Through this richer explanation and empirical assessment we contribute to our understanding of individual exploration activities which benefits our understanding of the micro-foundations of organizational exploration and adaptation, we provide a clarification of the inconclusive findings within the literature on the influence of relational embeddedness on exploration activities. And finally, we explain and demonstrate the importance of maintaining a relative balance between tacit and explicit knowledge during knowledge acquisition for the pursuit of exploration.",relational embeddedness| individual exploration activities| knowledge acquisition

To analyze the process by which collective cognition emerges from innovation teams, I invoke nested radii modeling techniques from complexity theory. Sometimes called flocking models, nested radii models have recently burgeoned in popularity amongst robotics engineers and scholars of animal behavior, but have yet to be applied to organization studies. Nested radii models link collective behavioral outcomes to the interaction of autonomous individual agents. Thus, they are ideally suited to breaching two assumptions constraining extant innovation scholarshipassumed independence between levels of analysis, and assumed independence between individuals within a given level of analysis. This study has both theoretical and practical implications for conceptualizing and negotiating tensions between exploration and exploitation.",innovation| complexity theory| emergent collective behavior

Prietula|Emory U.||,1|TIM Best Paper Proceedings||,"Patterns of collaboration once observed mainly in open source software have mushroomed beyond it, constituting an important part of the informal economy. As the economic impact of, and the interest in, such open collaboration systems of innovation and production have increased dramatically, we contribute to explaining and predicting their performance. Marrying theory and evidence from the innovation literature with recent empirical findings on human cooperation, we develop an agent-based model to examine the performance determinants of open collaboration as a general system for the innovation and provision of products and services, such as Linux and Wikipedia. We define the phenomenal boundaries and identify three performance-related elements: cooperativeness in the population, need heterogeneity of participants and rivalry (subtractability) of the goods. In three studies, we vary those elements while observing the impact on system performance. Results suggest that performance is surprisingly robust, even in seemingly inhospitable environments with free riders, rival goods and homogeneous participant needs. Specifically, because cooperators stimulate contagious behavior, reasonable performance is achievable even when they constitute just a sliver of the population. In most realistic situations, free riders matter little. While low rivalry improves performance, high performance is possible even with rival goods as long as participant needs are heterogeneous. Participants with diverse needs are an advantage, but even homogeneous needs can often be satisfied. The results imply that open collaboration is likely to continue its expansion into new areas of innovation and production. They also resolve some prior puzzles, illuminate the possibility of cooperation between fleeting strangers and offer policy implications.",open source| innovation| performance

To explore the relational aspects of creativity from a social network perspective, we adopt a sequential model of the creative process, suggesting that different network characteristics of individuals (global brokerage, local brokerage, and local embeddedness) have distinctive effects on three sequential stages in the creative process (knowledge search, integration, and validation) and consequently affect creative outcomes. The results from empirical analyses of 133 employees in one research organization reveal that global brokerage positively affects knowledge search. Also, local embeddedness is positively related to both knowledge integration and knowledge validation. Finally, these two processes, knowledge integration and knowledge validation mediate the relationships between local embeddedness and individual creativity. These findings suggest that individuals who occupy brokerage positions across teams tend to have advantages in searching knowledge. Moreover, individuals who are embedded within a team are more likely to be in an advantageous position to integrate knowledge and to receive a favorable evaluation of their own ideas from others, ultimately enjoying higher individual creativity.",social networks| individual creativity| creative process

We used the fixed effect model to analyze the panel data of 19,570 Korean manufacturing firms during the period from 2002 to 2007. Findings show that only the intensity of R&D outsourcing in high technology industries has effect on firm performance directly. We also observed the differences in high technology industries and medium/low technology industries in the ways in which highly skilled researchers moderate the effect of R&D outsourcing on the firm performance. In high technology industries group, R&D outsourcing is more strongly associated with firm!-s performance when the ratio of researchers with Ph.D. degrees is higher. However, the result in low technology industries shows that the ratio of Researcher in R&D employ has direct effect on the firm!-s performance, but does not moderate the effect of R&D outsourcing on a firm's performance. We provide the interpretation of these empirical results emphasizing the importance of firm!-s compositional factors in maximizing the result of R&D outsourcing.",absorptive capacity| r&d outsourcing| internalization

In line with previous works, we maintain that service innovation positively impacts firms performances but we also claim that this relationship is likely to be moderated by how the service firm conceives its service configuration. Particularly, we point out that service configurations based on standard and modular services positively moderate the positive relationship between innovation and performance. Using a sample of 239 Italian KIBS firms, we empirically test our model. Results confirm that service innovation is positively associated with firms performances both as market size and, albeit weakly, as ROI growth. Results also confirm the positive moderating role of standard services while the moderating role of modular services is only marginal. Overall, we contribute to the existing literature of KIBS and service innovation showing that service innovation and service customization should be considered as separate and that KIBS firms can experience increasing returns if they are able to combine service innovation and service standardization.",kibs| innovation| standard

Service innovation scholars have synthesized a set of organizational capabilities in the form of management techniques and processes used in service innovation management. Using these insights, we develop a framework that investigates how management innovation in services can contribute to performance by looking at its relationship with service innovation. By using dynamic capabilities theorizing, we hypothesize that the adoption of a set of specific management structures, systems, and processes facilitates service innovation and improves performance. We found support that management innovation in services is strongly associated with service innovation, which, in turn, fully mediates its relationship with firm performance.",management innovation| service innovation| dynamic capabilities

Insofar this phenomenon has largely been studied from the viewpoint of manufacturing businesses while services have received much less attention despite the predominant role they play in advanced economies. In this paper we investigate whether and how open service innovation differs from open innovation in manufacturing. We analyze a unique dataset generated through an original survey of open innovation practices amongst UK firms. We find that services are more active seekers of external knowledge than manufacturers and that the provision of a complex output which integrate a service component is associated with openness, and this holds true not only for services but for all businesses.  In addition, and against expectations, we find that universities and the public research base are relatively more important than customers as a source of external knowledge. The paper contributes to the theory of innovation by identifying the sectoral and firm-specific drivers of external knowledge searching and fills a very significant gap in the open innovation literature through its original quantitative and comparative analyses of open service innovation.",open innovation| service innovation| knowledge sources

In our framework, we distinguish two levels of positive attention: the initial attention hurdle (from no positive attention to one indication of positive attention) and the accumulated attention hurdle (more than one indication of positive attention).

In this inductive study, we investigate how collaborative prototyping across functional and organizational boundaries can improve the overall prototyping process. Our combined action research and case study approach reveals a formal and informal level of prototyping, in which the latter refers to the actual prototyping practice that involves short iterative trial-and-error cycles. On this level, collaborative prototyping transforms the act of prototyping from an activity belonging exclusively to the domain of (design) engineers to an activity integral to new product development that all members of a cross-functional team as well as external users can participate in. In effect, this collapses the making and evaluating steps in the prototyping process, allowing participants to see their suggestions implemented and exposing them to the design constraints. The study moreover shows how, at various stages of the prototyping process, the actual prototype was used as a tool for communication or development, thus serving as a platform for collaborative prototyping.",npd| prototyping| collaboration

Moreover, in tackling the issue of whether and when executives have strategic leeway, research has lately begun to examine nationality as a source of managerial discretion. Connecting these research streams, the present study develops a theoretical model of the impact of the individual CEOs attention to innovation on a firms innovation orientation (IO) and investigates to what degree the relationship is influenced by managerial discretion. The discretion is approximated by firm size on the organizational level, industry growth on the industrial level, and national context of the firms headquarter on the national level. Based on partly dyadic survey data from 228 German and US firms from diverse industries, as well as on archival industry growth data, the study finds that the CEOs attentional level of focus on innovation has a robustly positive impact on the firms IO, although the strength of the relationship depends on the degree of the CEOs managerial discretion.

When compared to the general employee population, lack of engagement is more of an issue for IT employees, (Treadwell & Alexander, 2011) who found that only 26% of IT employees reported full engagement and 22 % admitted to outright disengagement.  We examined the behavioral competencies of IT professionals and their relationships and interactions with the organizational environment and employee engagement.   We collected survey data from 795 IT professionals (individual contributors and managers) in the United States and Canada.

In this paper, we aim to shed some light into this rising study field from the perspective of foreign companies operating in China. After a literature review about international innovation management in China, we conduct a secondary data analysis about innovation activities in China from a macro-economic perspective. Understanding this macro-economic framework is an important requirement to classify any international innovation activity of companies. Next, we augment this macro-orientated perspective by a functional management perspective. We tackle the 'how-' rather than the 'if-' questions of foreign innovation management in China. These questions have been widely neglected in current research. Based on existing evidence about innovation activities of foreign companies in China and based on our qualitative data collection in Beijing, we developed a case study with two multinational companies in China. The first company has just begun to set up innovation activities in China. The second company has more than ten years of experience within innovation management in China.

We also investigate how individualism-collectivism dimension moderates the relationship between management innovation and technological innovation. The results indicate individualism to be positively related to propensity to innovate because emphasis on personal freedom allows individuals to think and act creatively, but collectivism is positively associated to innovative performance, where social interaction and collaboration are more important for commercialization of innovative ideas. Furthermore, interaction effects demonstrate that in collectivistic cultures, management innovation plays a more important stimulating role in enhancing technological innovation than in individualistic ones.",management innovation| technological innovation| individualism-collectivism

In the current literature of export performance study, however, there is a methodological gap in quantifying the domestic contents of exports from total exports. Therefore the domestic technological change cannot be clearly identified and analyzed. This paper bridged the gap by employing a unique Input-Output model to derive the domestic contents from total exports and to analyze the nature of related technological change. Our data analysis of China!-s exports of manufacturing products for 1992-2009 reveals: (1) China!-s participation in the global vertical specialization (VS) in high-tech sector grew faster and faster chronically; (2) the VS participation was more aggressive in high-tech than in the medium-tech, low-tech and resources based sectors; and (3) the net domestic contents in China!-s exports in high-tech sectors grew much faster than the other sectors. The findings indicate that China!-s export-oriented growth strategy, instead of creating dependence on low-tech and resource-based exports, had led to a rapid growth in sophisticated high-tech manufacturing with its endogenous capability.",global vertical specialization| endogenous capability| export performance

A key challenge in managing new relationships is lack of trust. We explore the mechanisms that firms employ to build trust with new technology suppliers in new product development (NPD). We identify four mechanisms to build trust with unfamiliar suppliers in NPD: (1) gathering information about a partner competencies to build competence trust, and (2) setting mutual goals early on in the relationship to preserve equity and fairness, (3) relying on personal trust between the individuals enacting the organisational relationship, and (4) relying on shared problem solving rather than contract based dispute resolution to build goodwill trust. We explore how these mechanisms were employed in four NPD projects within one telecom company. We find that when gathering information to build competence trust fails, shared problem solving emerges as the key mechanism for building goodwill trust. Our findings also highlight the interdependency between the mechanisms employed to develop goodwill trust: shared problem solving is found to be more effective to build goodwill trust in the presence of strong mutual interests and strong personal bases for trust.",trust| new product development| technology suppliers

Sound marketing mix decision-making, and the allocation of appropriate firm resources to the product's promotion and distribution, are ultimately responsible for the success of the new product launch. However, even after a successfully planned launch, projects can go wrong. Relatively high levels of uncertainty complicate the launch decision-making process and sub-optimal decision-making is a commonly observed phenomenon. Often, launch decisions must be re-evaluated and follow-up decisions need to be made. Much then depends on the decision-maker's commitment to earlier decisions. In particular escalation of commitment has been studied as an example of sub-optimal or even irrational follow-up decision-making in innovation projects. Still, the precise role and antecedents of commitment in a new product launch decision-making context remain relatively unclear. Taking an information processing view on decision-making, and making use of the theories of reasoned action and escalation of commitment, the objective of the present study is to investigate effects of two types of information  relevant and irrelevant - on two outcomes of the launch decision-making process: judgment and commitment. In a decision-making experiment, while providing an invariable set of relevant information to the participants, we manipulate a set of information that is irrelevant to the launch decision, but which influences the decision-makers morale, and investigate effects on resource allocation and commitment. Partial least squares structural equation modeling is used to estimate the model parameters.We found that decisions regarding the allocation of resources were directly influenced by the rational beliefs regarding the expectancy of the outcomes, which were based upon the relevant information provided. The irrelevant information however was shown to affect (initial) commitment through the morale of the decision-maker  i.e. their emotional attitude towards the business organization. A substantial indirect effect was also found of morale on the resource allocation decision.

We find that firms in competitive markets tend to make more CVC investments and, furthermore, increase the relative magnitude of CVC over internal R&D investments. In addition, CVC investment appears to be an effective way of exploiting external knowledge for firms that are technology leaders in their respective industrial sector but not so for technology laggards. Third, we show that competition plays a less role in explaining CVC investments when firms operate in more uncertain markets. Finally, we show that the text-based network industry classifications are more informative than three digit SIC classifications in explaining CVC decisions.

Due to path dependencies incumbents struggle to design appropriate business models out of fear of cannibalizing their competitive advantage. While governments often provide incentives to push firms towards sustainable innovation, such incentives also restrain managerial discretion. This paper investigates how firms deal with this tension by exploring how the confluence of incumbents path dependencies and government support affects strategic choices in the design of emerging business models for sustainable technologies. Based on a longitudinal study of the emergence of electric vehicles, the paper concurs that incumbents stay (too) close to prevailing business models. Firms that depend on government support also face the risk of an incentive curse. Government incentives that aim to improve a products attractiveness might cause firms to make counter-economic choices, rendering the technology unattractive in due course.Paper is No Longer Available Online: Please contact the author(s).",

Specifically, we focus on the role of financial and human capital constraints on the utilization of technical specialists and technical generalists in the context of new technologyabased entrepreneurial ventures.  Using data on entrepreneurial project teams from the National Institute of Science and Technology, we find that more constrained ventures utilize smaller teams. In turn, smaller teams exhibit fewer technical specialists and more technical generalists.  The results suggest that resource constrained ventures are more likely to use the resources on hand to fill multiple roles.",human capital| team composition| technology ventures

Relying on team diversity research, we hypothesize that both demographic and functional diversity of the R&D workforce influence technological performance. In addition, we expect that both types of diversity interact with each other. We test our hypothesized relationships using unique survey data on 794 Singapore firms collected by The Agency of Science, Technology and Research. We use variety in educational background and knowledge areas of R&D employees as indicators of functional diversity. Demographic diversity is captured using variety in gender and nationality of R&D employees. The number of patent applications is used as a proxy for technological performance. Our findings point to significant interactions between different sources of R&D workforce diversity. In particular, we identify substitutive relationships between (a) educational and gender diversity, and (b) nationality and knowledge area diversity.",diversity| r&d manpower| technological performance

This study focuses on a particular aspect of the organization of R&D-intensive teams, the level of knowledge overlap of its members. We analyze the relevant trade-off a firm needs to solve when choosing the optimal level of knowledge overlap for its R&D team. In fact, on the one hand, a large knowledge overlap is often associated with low coordination costs. On the other hand, to the extent that production in R&D-intensive sectors consists of problem solving, a large overlap is then associated with a low probability that the solution to these problems lies within the team knowledge set. We show that, under certain conditions, there exists a level of knowledge overlap which maximizes the present discounted value generated from the innovations produced by the team, over its life horizon. We test this prediction using a novel dataset on R&D top management teams in Formula 1. Having controlled for a large number of factors, we find an inverted u-shaped relation between the value produced by the team and its degree of knowledge overlap.",knowledge overlap| r&d team| innovation

I find that, in states with more trade secrets cases, inventor mobility was lower, with the effect attenuated by the stock of CNC cases. Further, I find that, in states with more CNC cases, inventor mobility was lower, with the effect attenuated by stock of trade secrets cases.So, knowledge-based businesses are affected by both trade secrets and CNC law.

Although government taxation incentives have a direct impact on R&D expenditure, firms as a whole in the same industrial parks have a certain level of flexibility to adapt to the policy and therefore develop a U-shaped growth trend of R&D expenditure.  Moreover, instead of finding that R&D expenditure has a direct influence on innovation performance as indicated by the previous literature, our study shows that the effect is time-lagged.

While New Public Management is rarely seen a catalyst of innovation, public management reforms have caused a wave of administrative innovations and an ensuing wave of critique of these same innovations. In this paper, we explore this phenomenon and ask what are the sources of administrative innovation in the public sector? By drawing on the concept of sources of innovation and the literature on innovation by users, we re-read New Public Management as an administrative innovation agenda, where departmental bureaucracy has been the dominant source of innovation, which explains parts of the critique. Based on the concept of users as innovators and with a view to future research, we suggest possible alternative sources of administrative innovations and what these might contribute.",public management| user innovation| administrative innovation

Open innovation has been heralded as an important approach for the acceleration of the innovation process, especially for large, established firms. The impact of open innovation practices of young firms, whose resources and capabilities differ significantly from those of more mature firms, has been left nearly unexplored. In addition, the quantitative analysis of the effects of open innovation on firm performance is scarce. While size comparisons are important, age-specific factors are potentially more influential on the outcomes of open innovation activities. Thus, this research seeks to compare different open innovation activities of young verses established firms, and explore their effects on innovation and financial performance. The analysis of survey-based data from 1,202 UK firms across multiple sectors shows that established firms engage more strongly in inbound activities while young firms are significantly more active in knowledge and technology transfer (outbound activities). However, these preferences are not always fruitful as only selected open innovation activities are beneficial for young and established firms. Different open innovation activities are relevant for different types of performance. This research contributes to theory and practice by questioning the generalizability of the open innovation concept and highlighting activity and age-specific factors that trigger the variability in the effect of open innovation activities on different types of firm performance.",open innovation| young firms| financial performance

Open innovation is regularly perceived as a purposive strategic move. This move may be bounded by other managerial choices in innovation. Firms need to make a decision about their legal IP position and about their innovation focus  product, process, service or integrated product-services innovation. So far, little is known whether patenting and innovation focus shape the way how firms implement open innovation; especially in small and medium-sized firms (SMEs). Using a large-scale sample of manufacturing SMEs, this paper examines the role of patenting and the innovation focus in a firms open innovation sourcing activities. When opening up to external sources, SMEs may make a choice to engage in supply chain, downstream, technology-oriented, or ecosystem-wide sourcing.  Patenting positively shapes a firms choice to engage in technology-oriented sourcing. Focusing on process or process-services innovation makes the choice for upstream-sourcing more likely. Most importantly, a focus on product, service and product-services innovation seems to affect SMEs move towards eco-system wide sourcing.",open innovation| manufacturing smes| service innovation

CRM implementation and success has already been extensively analysed in large companies, but there is still a need to understand it in the context of small companies. The contribution of this paper is to analyse the factors that affect CRM in small companies, going beyond existing literature (centred on static success factors which are not explicitly linked to outcomes and not treated as interrelated), as well as proposing and validating a CRM success scale and a CRM success model which integrates organizational readiness, knowledge management capabilities, CRM technology and customer orientation. The research is based on a literature review and an empirical study in 238 small service companies. Results indicate that organizational readiness mediates the effects of the other considered factors on CRM success. Consequently, variables such as top management support, employee training and motivation, together with organizational structure/processes are crucial for CRM success in small companies.",crm technology| small companies| crm success factors

We find ideas in the IMS that represent user innovation more likely to be successful than the other ideas in the IMS, and the result held with two different measures of the success.  We find the odds of success are increased by a factor of 86.9 for the ideas that describe employee-user innovations, and increased for a factor of 1.24 for every additional year of the employees tenure, holding other variables constant.

The organizational ambidexterity hypothesis asserts that ambidextrousorganizations perform better than those that are not ambidextrous in this sense. There is now an established and burgeoning literature on organizational ambidexterity. That literature, however, largely is silent on the strategic aspects of managerial decision making pertaining to ambidexterity and R&D investments. This paper complements the existing organizational ambidexterity literature by undertaking gametheoretic analyses of R&D investment decisions. It produces, among other things, 11 hypotheses and a three-fold distinction between kinds of ambidexterity (primary, defensive,and strategic) reflecting game-theoretic nuances applicable to organizational ambidexterity situations. These hypotheses and distinctions will be useful to both managers and scholars.",organizational ambidexterity| research and development| game theory and strategic analysis

Extant studies have often examined the consequences of a simultaneous implementation of exploration and exploitation, but overlooked the option to balance both activities over time. In this paper, we focus upon the method of temporal separation in which corporations alternate between periods focused on discovery and experimentation and times concentrating upon refinement and efficiency. We argue that most organizations actually combine simultaneous and sequential balancing. This is confirmed by our observations. Since both methods have their obvious benefits, we hypothesize that the performance effects are contingent upon firm-specific factors: its environmental velocity, its resource endowment and its business strategy. By testing our theory on panel dataset regarding the innovative ambidexterity of Fortune 500 firms over a ten-year period, we find partial support for our hypotheses. Particularly corporations rich in financial and technological resources can benefit from a more radical implement of dynamic sequential ambidexterity compared to a static simultaneous approach.",ambidexterity| firm performance| technological innovation

Both exploration and exploitation climates support radical innovation since such innovation is enhanced by both supplementary and complementary fit. An exploitation climate, however, supports while an exploration climate harms continuous improvement since continuous improvement is enhanced only by supplementary fit. Moreover, learning climates of information distribution and information interpretation shapes the relationships between exploitation and exploration by encouraging activities in which supplementary relationships are strengthened and complementary relationships also act as supplementary fit. These hypotheses were supported by examining a sample of 28 teams from three high-tech electronics companies. Unexpectedly, a negative side of learning was also revealed: too much of a supplementary fit harmed continuous improvement. Practically, managers can improve their organizations radical innovation performance by encouraging both exploration and exploitation and should be less concerned about harming their organizations radical innovativeness than damaging its continual improvement.",exploration-exploitation| fit theory| radical innovation

Micro-innovation has been proposed as a remedial mechanism by which localised socio-economic impact can be generated by those constrained by institutional voids. This paper seeks to contribute to understanding of how micro-innovation might deliver such impact and how, if at all, Government might nurture this form of activity. To do so, we utilise the nascent grassroots innovation perspective. Grassroots innovation is a form of micro-innovation where a knowledge rich but economically impoverished innovator creates social and economic value through innovation bricolage (making do). By exploring the emergence of 16 grassroots innovations in India, we inductively develop a model of grassroots innovation practice. Cross case analysis reveals five key emergent themes which potentially impact the social and economic value of grassroots innovations. Drawing on these themes, we analyse the effectiveness of government intervention in the cases of the grassroots innovators observed. We suggest that government can play a useful role in fostering micro-innovation activities but equally, there are limitations to the scope of such intervention which might be overcome by engaging with the private sector.",grassroots innovation| informal economy| institutional voids

We find that the proportion of genomics life scientists residing in the U.S., and the time they spend in the U.S. have decreased substantially since the late-1990s. This contrasts with the sharp increase in the BRIC countries, particularly in China and India, and to a lesser extent, non-US OECD countries. We find that the overall decline is driven largely by the decreasing proportion of university and public sector scientists in the U.S. Paralleling this, we also find that the innovative productivity growth of public sector scientists in the U.S. has slowed down relative to their counterparts in the private sector in the U.S., and also relative to scientists in the public sector in non-US OECD and BRIC countries.

In contrast to mainstream thinking, our research supports the proposition that perceptions of procedural fairness, rather than absorptive capacity, determine effectiveness, especially in cases of high tacit knowledge transfers. We collected data from senior ICT representatives in 86 Canadian subsidiaries of foreign owned MNEs. Each of these subsidiaries recently experienced a significant ICT transfer imposed by the parent organization. We found support for our main propositions: Procedural justice significantly predicted successful ICT transfer and adoption, while absorptive capacity was not significant. These findings were consistent even when knowledge tacitness was high. The perceived success of the ICT transfer as well as its adoption varied widely across these firms. The potential reasons for this divergence in effectiveness are manifold, but our findings suggest that in situations of substantial knowledge tacitness, a higher level of procedural fairness, rather than more absorptive capacity, is critical to effective transfer and adoption.",absorptive capacity| information and communications technology| procedural justice

Though research indicates that a majority of employees state a willingness to telework, a small minority in organizations actually enable employees to do so. The status quo is traditional work, identifying a clear gap in our knowledge between individual willingness and organizational will. Drawing upon prospect theory, this study empirically tests framing interventions that elicit managerial preferences regarding telework adoption. Findings of the field study are in line with the lab study supporting the proposition that a deeply embedded cognitive bias for traditional work acts as a barrier to telework adoption, but that strategic interventions can re-frame the telework proposition to effectively shift that bias in favour of telework. Knowledge is further extended through the identification and testing of a new frame of reference that positions the traditional workplace as the less optimal choice.

It is therefore timely to consider how IT decision support systems (DSS) may be constructed to support managers in a marginalised area of leadership, that of ethical decision making. Although knowledge about, and availability of, strategic frameworks and tools in management learning is widespread, ethical DSS are less available, because of the newness of the topic area and the complexity of the endeavour. We present an action research study of the development of an elusive artefact, a web-based DSS for ethical decision making relevant for managerial use. Our research contribution is threefold. Firstly, we add to IT research by explaining how ethical stances can be used as frames for constructing the ethical DSS. Secondly, we connect IT to ethics by demonstrating how such a tool can enable ethical framing tasks of diagnosis, prognosis and motivation to act in banking scenarios and, thirdly, we show how action research can be a valid and valuable approach for IT and ethics research and practice.",ethical decision support system| ethical frames| action research

Recent RI products such as Apples iPhone, iPad, and iTunes and Amazons Kindle have demonstrated the potentially salubrious effect of RI. Alas technological uncertainty, business inexperience, and unknown customer preferences render RI a high risk proposition. Accordingly, the innovation processes of RI and II are different: whilst incremental innovation is widely studied through gate and structured process models comparatively little is known how to engage and manage RI. One reason for this is that conceptualizations of RI do not adequately reflect critical interdependencies in the CE/IT ecosystem that permit identification or RI opportunities. To analyze RI processes and how they recognize interdependencies within the CE/IT ecosystem we conducted semi-structured interviews among 38 highly experienced designers and innovation managers.  Using grounded theory to analyze the interviews we propose a new conceptualization of RI that suggests that RI emerges from novel interactions between technology, application and market trends. To illustrate these interactions we formulate Technology, Application and Market Trend (TAMT) model that depicts the novel dynamics of RI and highlights differences between RI and II.  Using the model we note that unarticulated market needs form the key source of most RIs. Radical innovators need to constantly search for an unarticulated market needs by using experimentation and bold thinking to identify RI opportunities and engage in it successfully.",radical innovation| application| market trend

Therefore, this study investigates whether differences between early adopters of disruptive and sustaining innovations exist. Common theoretical frameworks are reviewed and a combination of elements from distinct theories is used to create a new model of consumer innovativeness. Following the compilation of this model, disruptive innovation theory is applied to theorize differences between early adopters of disruptive and sustaining innovations. Subsequently, we analyze data from a heterogonous sample of consumers (n=849) using structural equation modeling and multi-group analysis. The results suggest that early adopters of disruptive innovations are more knowledgeable in the product domain than early adopters of sustaining innovation. In contrast, consumers that purchase sustaining innovations relatively early are more involved in the product domain than early adopters of disruptive innovation. Consequently, managers need to address early adopters differently depending on the type of innovation. Further typologies of early adopters of disruptive and sustaining innovations as well as theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",disruptive innovation| consumer innovativeness| new product adoption

However, previous empirical research has found mixed results for the impact of collaborations with customers on innovative performance. We consider that these ambiguous results may be due to omitted interaction effects between investing in R&D, in marketing, and in collaborative arrangements with customers.  Drawing on a panel dataset of over 2,000 manufacturing firms, we extend this line of research by distinguishing between the introduction of innovations and innovation performance measured as the share of turnover due to innovations.  Furthermore, we distinguish between radical and incremental innovators. We find that overall investing in R&D and cooperating with customers increase the likelihood of introducing innovations, but not the innovative sales.  Marketing investments have the opposite effect. Cooperating with clients drives the introduction of innovations when R&D investments and marketing investments are low, but not when they are high.  These collaborations do not increase the share of innovative sales.  We also find significant differences between factors influencing radical and incremental innovator performance.  Our results identify important variations in the effective allocation of firms resources and also the conditions under which cooperation with customers generates benefits to the firm.",cooperation with customers| r&d and marketing| innovative performance

In an empirical study of 159 physician-scientists, I find that developmental network range and cohesion relate to the quantity and quality of novices subsequent work. Having strong ties within the network can be a substitute for cohesion. However, having a prominent member in the developmental network moderates these relationships. When a novice scientists network contains a prominent member, only range relates to subsequent knowledge creation. In contrast, when a novice scientists network does not contain a prominent member, strong ties or cohesive networks are critical for future knowledge creation. This study illuminates alternate paths by which novices can use and benefit from their developmental networks in their future careers.",developmental networks| knowledge creation| careers

Results of the time series analysis identify the shift in this logic to the late 1950s, a key time in Major League Baseballs history when, for the first time, each team had at least one African American player on their roster and each team had an average of at least one full time scout based in a country outside the United States.  Both of these indicators reveal a broader search for talent which manifested itself in hall of famer developmental networks which instead of being more based on the players around them were instead more tied to indicators of MLBs global search for talent as well as more business-oriented factors including average ticket prices and player salaries.  A more detailed investigation of these networks reveals that many new developer roles utilized in the 1958-2004 market logic era were created by the teams themselves thus giving these players greater opportunity to utilize potential developers that were more readily available than in the previous more insular logic period.",developmental networks| institutional logics| career success

We suggest that this research has neglected potential negative consequences of networking and develop a framework to examine costs of networking. In elaborating a cost-benefit approach that draws upon conservation of resources, economics, and role theory, we suggest that networking yields production costs as well as opportunity costs. We test this model in a study of N = 290 employed individuals and their partners. We find that networking is associated with temporal and cognitive investments into the work role that we consider production costs. We also find evidence for opportunity costs as networking is associated with work-family conflict. In addition, there is evidence that integrating these domains attenuates opportunity costs. As an indicator of the net effect of networking, we find an inverted u-shaped relation of networking with Life Balance, showing that individuals with high as well as low networking scores more likely experience imbalance. In sum, this study shows that next to the literature on networking benefits, networking is also associated with costs that individuals should take into account.",networking| careers| work family conflict

A common view is that boundary spanners exist between firms, reconciling potentially conflicting views and fostering trust during negotiations.  This paper contains evidence that boundary spanners also exist within firms, brokering relationships between R&D scientists and management.  Using a sample of U.S. chemical manufacturing firms from 1996 to 2005, I find that boundary spanning individuals serving on the firms Board of Directors, who possess both scientific and executive management credentials,  increase firm innovative output and overall firm value, diminish the negative impact that organizational tension has on firm innovation, foster the creation of the firms technological domain expertise, and increase the chances that the firm creates very important technological innovations.  In general, this paper provides compelling evidence suggesting that firms should recruit board-level boundary spanning individuals that can broker difficult discussions between R&D scientists and management within R&D-intensive firms.",boundary spanners| innovation| r&d

Moreover, building on the intuition that network centrality leads to embeddedness, we argue that central inventors should benefit more from the spin-out experience than peripheral inventors.

It states that incumbent firms fail to invest in new technologies when these are not demanded by their existing market, due to forces of resource dependency and the associated assumption that customers control firms internal resource allocation processes. While the problem of disruptive innovation has been convincingly described, there is still a need for managerial solutions. We argue that a main reason why such solutions are lacking can be found in the asymmetric assumptions made in the original theory of disruptive innovation. Specifically, the focal firm is treated as a collection of heterogeneous actors with different preferences, incentives and competencies, whereas firms in the surrounding environment are treated as if they contained no such heterogeneity. A consequence, the theory on disruptive innovation has described incumbents as controlled by their environment, but has failed to recognize that the environment can also be influenced. In this paper we argue that a more symmetric theory of disruptive innovation  i.e. one that treats all similar entities in the same way  raises opens up for a range of interesting managerial solutions to the innovators dilemma.",disruptive innovation| business model| methodology

This perspective has showed how periods of increased uncertainty and competition may evolve into creative destruction, the breakdown of established patterns and the advance of new, attacking firms. A recent version is the theory of disruptive innovation which has claimed its explanatory power in a number of cases. However, this paper shows that there are major sectors marked by technological complexity and high capital intensity where technological discontinuities result in a different kind of dynamics, a pattern of creative accumulation rather than destruction and disruption. Through in depth and comparative analyses of industry cases where disruptive innovation has been predicted but not realized the paper explains why the predictions failed and highlights key aspects of the creative accumulation processes that did occur. These aspects include, on the part of the newcomer, the difficulty of accumulating the requisite knowledge base and integrating this with existing technology. However, established firms do not have any guarantees for success either; only those incumbents that have the ability to fine-tune existing technologies at a rapid pace, to develop complementary technologies and resources, and to integrate new and existing knowledge into innovative new products will survive. The concluding sections highlight the conditions under which creative accumulation rather than disruptive innovation can best explain the impact of discontinuous change, and tease out strategic implications for the organization of creative accumulation.",creative accumulation| creative destruction| disruptive innovation

We rely on actor-network theory to address our research question. The research field is Air Liquide, a multinational company in industrial and medical gas market. Our findings show that the old technological network encountered the new one by its cognitive, organizational, and political resistance. The old technology-new technology loop can be described as composed of four main phases: recognition, political negotiation, experimentation, and conversion. Underlying these four phases was a translation dynamics that helped deal with the old technologys resistance.

Using the LP record as an empirical case, we propose that the central mechanism at play is the recasting of technological features from the functional-utilitarian to the aesthetic realm.

This is relevant because of a teaching force ageing and a trend towards early retirement, leading to teacher shortages and retention challenges. Employing life course theory, this paper assumes that motivations regarding such transitions are based on a teacher's institutional, organizational and private-life context. The paper uses a qualitative multi-level case study design, and employs 20 biographical interviews with teachers aged 50plus and 26 interviews with experts in two school districts. Using thematic analysis, the study found that teachers' conceptualizations of their late careers are influenced by individually-specific, though overall similar factors, such as stress, financial background and family. However, British and German teachers use divergent strategies to approach career choices. These mirror the respective institutional context. Despite this, British teachers were mostly able to employ human agency within an overall enabling structure to adapt career transitions to their individual needs. German teachers had less opportunities to use human agency due to a more restricting institutional structure. Human agency could, however, be used to shape transitions at the individual's own expense by, for example, self-financing early retirement.",life course| work-retirement transition| career

Combining with the ambidexterity, legitimacy and complementarity logics, we propose that when facing a rival!|s market with high upstream and/or high downstream/complement challenges, firms can form alliance diversification in the targeted market through cross-industry ambidextrous alliances in balancing exploration and exploitation, and sequentially seek intra-industry ambidextrous alliances due to unpredictable outcomes and complementary assets with other partners along the value chain.

Given that MO and innovation are two core issues of marketing research, this limitation creates a gap in both understanding and adoption of MO and its relationship with innovation. Drawing from both MO and innovation literature, the authors developed and tested a theoretical model, which explained individual!-s MO and innovation under the influence of intrafirm interaction networks. Two types of intrafirm network were identified as related to MO and innovation in this study: advice and friendship network, according to network literature. This paper displayed a direct link of advice network centrality to innovation as a result of individual MO, which is also moderated by this individual!-s network centrality. On the other hand, friendship network centrality has shown no direct relationship with innovation, but rather a moderating effect upon individual MO level, and upon advice network centrality as well. Furthermore, this paper also offered a counter intuitive finding: higher friendship network centrality may reduce individual!-s tendency for innovation, given that he/she showed the same level of customer information response: one of the three behavioral dimensions of MO. Thus, how connected an individual is among colleagues was found a significant factor, as compared with MO reward as an economic factor, for individuals to achieve higher level of innovation under MO. The theoretical contributions to MO literature by this paper was also summed up as presenting for the first time a social network aspect of MO and innovation relationship at individual level.

Patent data from the USPTO on 4695 patents from the biopharmaceutical industry are used in order to explore the relationship between recombination and technological impact. A negative binomial regression model shows significant results and the best model fit for a sigmoid relationship. Apparently, there is a trap in between impactful incremental types of inventions and impactful radical types of inventions.

While Chrysler introduced a front-wheel drive minivan in 1984, Ford and General Motors initially introduced rear-wheel drive minivans. This choice provided an advantage to Chrysler in the family vehicle product market niche that lasted over fifteen years. This paper uses a multiple case study, focusing on the transition from station wagons to front-wheel drive minivans, to understand the response of established firms to technological change.

We investigated the roles of both dynamic and operational capabilities of the firm, and the role of sectoral barriers, on the performance of the firm. Our analysis is based on a study including some 12000 manufacturing enterprises in Quebec, Canada. We developed some new measures of capabilities, barriers and performance. Our hypotheses about a different role of dynamic or operational capabilities in a declining sector are partially confirmed.

It outlines how modularity increases at the product and organizational level, focusing on codification of standardized interfaces and stabilization of organizational practices. Industry modularity increases when product interfaces and organizational practices disseminate beyond the focal organization. Several moderating factors that influence this dissemination process are highlighted. At the product level I focus, first, on strategic considerations regarding standardization, and second on capability trajectories and firm specialization. At the organizational level I highlight informational mechanisms and convergence of cognitive frames, and the role of technological breakthroughs and its influence on the complexity and interaction of organizational practices. As such, the study presents a contingent perspective toward understanding changes in industry modularity.",modularity| framework| industry architecture

Groesser|U. of Applied Sciences Bern||,,"Developments in the last decade indicate that reducing energy demand is imperative. Since the residential building sector is a major contributor to this demand, political decision makers address this sector intensively. The availability of high energy-efficiency in legal building standards assumes a domain role. However, the formation of standards is a complex process of innovation and diffusion, and consequently is not easily understood. This paper reports on a simulation model that was developed to study the co-evolution of legal and voluntary building codes for the revelatory case of Switzerland. Based on an endogenous innovation, diffusion, and standardization-cycle, the model explains the intensification of voluntary and legal building standards regarding their energy efficiency. The model first reproduces the historical situation, and is then used to estimate the possible impact of scenarios and interventions on energy efficiency in building codes and greenhouse gas emissions until the year 2050. The paper concludes that continuously institutionalizing voluntary standards is important for the intensification of the legal standard as well as for the development of energy efficiency in the residential sector. Moreover, it demonstrates that a well-balanced scheme of incentives is required to positively influence the system development and reduce protective actions by incumbent agents.",co-evolution| multiple agents| simulation

In this research we look to unpack the relationship between resource scarcity and slack and digital infrastructure innovation through an exploratory study of two computationally-intensive research centers. We find that digital infrastructure innovation appears to be quite different from other types of innovative activity in that exploratory behaviors directly precede resource acquisition.

We present evidence from all entrants into the speech recognition industry, where a greenfield commercialization environment affords wide latitude in strategic choice. While the initial choice of commercialization strategy does not predict performance, subsequently pivoting to another strategy strongly increases the hazard of a liquidity event. Intra-industry spinoffs are particularly likely to pivot. Results are confirmed when we instrument for pivoting with the unanticipated 2001 demise of the industrys largest technology licensor following an accounting scandal. Our results extend the literature on commercialization strategies, both by examining the dynamics of strategy-making and their impact on ultimate outcomes.

We predict a negative relationship by tracing the innovation performance effects of secrecy and knowledge inflows back to information asymmetry and signaling theory. However, secrecy is not an end in itself. We hypothesize further that firms past innovation success affects the effectiveness of secrecy in a negative way.

Despite the role that joiners may play in the success of entrepreneurial ventures, little is known about this group of entrepreneurially-oriented individuals or how they may differ from founders.  Using a novel survey of the entrepreneurial intentions of 4,194 PhDs across fields of science and engineering, we find that 11% of respondents intend to be founders, while 45% are attracted to working in a startup, but not as a founder (i.e., joiners).  Regression results demonstrate that founders and joiners exhibit similar entrepreneurial profiles compared to individuals not interested in entrepreneurship, yet with significant differences along several key dimensions.  More precisely, founders and joiners share similar preferences for wealth, risk, and commercialization, yet founders have stronger preferences for autonomy. While joiner intentions are related to broader departmental norms that encourage entrepreneurship, founder intentions are largely independent of such normative influences. However, founder intentions are related to entrepreneurial activities of advisors. We also find that of all PhDs who believe that their research has commercial value only 20% intend to be a founder while over 50% intend to be a joiner. These findings have implications for individuals selection into entrepreneurial careers and suggest that individual, social, and opportunity factors all play different roles in shaping entrepreneurial intentions.",entrepreneurship| scientists| engineers

We find that growth in scientific knowledge increases the birth rate curvilinearly (inverted U-shape), with the early period of knowledge creation especially important for births.  In contrast, technical knowledge growth as patents, decreases birth rates. Human capital availability is a significant factor, with growth of nano scientists increasing but growth of nano patent authors decreasing birth rates of de novo dedicated nanotechnology firms.

Research on this recent phenomenon is ambiguous. Some argue that NPEs create a more efficient market for ideas by reducing transactions costs. Others contend that they destroy value through excessive litigation and incentivizing the development of frivolous patents. We contribute to the resolution of this debate by proposing a contingent perspective on the implications of NPE activity.

Contrary to this notion, using the recently initiated patent reforms in India, we show that stronger patents can actually increase competition. Building on the literature on Markets for Technology (MFT) we build model that identifies conditions under which stronger patents can actually stimulate competition as opposed to retarding it.  We show that stronger patents increase entry by firms that do not have the ability to produce proprietary technology because stronger patents facilitate entry by in-licensing. On the other hand for firms, that do not have complementary capability but can generate proprietary technology, stronger patents makes it more attractive to out-license rather than entering product markets. Assuming that multinationals have high technical capability and relatively low complementary capability and that domestic firms have low technical and high complementary capability, we hypothesize that stronger patents should facilitate licensing between multinationals and domestic firms, especially to those that are incapable of producing proprietary technology. Our empirical results bear out the intuition that on an average, patenting activity increases with stronger patents and by more for multinationals relative to domestic firms and also by more in disembodied industries relative to embodied markets. Also, as a consequence we show that licensing activity and competition increases with stronger patents and by more in disembodied industries while licensing activity increases with stronger patents and by more in disembodied industries.",innovation| patents| markets for technology

Further, individual characteristics (e.g., behavioral integrity) of mentors and proteges were examined for their impact on mentoring relational quality. Professional identification and other outcomes were predicted as consequences of mentoring relational quality.

In line with the theoretical framework, within-domain demands showed relatively strong positive relationships to negative spillovers from work to family and from family to work. Positive spillovers were expected to more likely occur due to the activation of within-domain resources rather than the absence of within-domain demands.

Control over one's work enabled self-employed workers to minimize negative spillover from work-to-family, but it did not increase positive work-to-family spillover.

Specifically, we draw on psychological contracts theory and the group value model to argue that Machiavellianism will moderate the relationships between psychological contract breach and (1) organizational identification; and (2) organizational disidentification. In a study of 262 employees from various organizations, we found that employees with higher levels of Machiavellianism tended to disidentify with their organizations to a greater extent (at Time 2) in response to psychological contract breach (at Time 1) than did low-Mach employees.

Utilizing an exploratory, longitudinal case study design of three cases, we extend theory on boundaryless careers.  Our analysis highlights how life stage events such as motherhood can have a profound influence on the perception of careers and the complex interaction of work and family life on career transitions.  In particular we unearthed two main micro-processes in career transitions.  Firstly, leaving traditional employment; characterized by personal changes in motivation and family support that were instrumental in career transitions to pursue self employment.  Secondly creating boundaries; specify the organizational and life stage variables such as business success and changes in lifestyle that allowed boundaries to be imposed onto careers.  Over time the women introduced boundaries that resonated with their former corporate careers.  Thus, our findings critique the notion of the boundaryless career by highlighting various boundaries that the women have installed in order to provide sanity to their home and business life, and which echo those within corporate careers.",boundaryless careers| mompreneurs| case study

Supplier management strategies are key to increase suppliers sustainability performance. While focal firms sustainable supplier management practices towards their first-tier suppliers have been studied relatively extensively, little is known on how firms may approach suppliers beyond the first-tier level, the sub-suppliers. Focal firms challenges range from the mere identification of sub-suppliers to little opportunities to enforce sub-suppliers practices. This paper investigates the sub-supplier management practices of two focal firms in the electronic and retail industry by case study research. It proposes that by actively managing sub-suppliers through assessment and collaboration firms can improve sub-suppliers compliance with their CSS,  that (1) public attention, (2) risk management, and (3) channel power are antecedents to sub-supplier management, and that stakeholder involvement amplifies the effect of sub-supplier management on sub-suppliers compliance with their CSS.This paper is novel in addressing the management of higher tiers of upstream sub-suppliers, proposing a framework for understanding sustainability compliance in sub-supplier management.",sub-supplier management| corporate sustainability standards| sustainable supply chain management

Firms can analyze the cost drivers and evaluate alternative cost-reduction opportunities by preparing for the adoption of ISO14001. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between ISO14001 certification and financial performance. The event study methodology was employed for the analysis. We looked into 5,189 listed firms in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation (NASDAQ), and found 331 firms which were certified from 1996 to 2010. Financial performance was measured by seven dependent variables (ROA1, ROA2, ROS, Stock Price, Tobin!-s Q, COGS/SALES, and SGR) and the certified firms were compared to the control firms which were developed by using three criteria (Industry, ROA, and Assets). Our study shows that ISO 14001 is positively related to financial performance. Especially, since ISO14001 certification requires long term to achieve, it is beneficial to the firm in the long run.

Consequently, purchasing managers are facing a trade-off between green, social and cost criteria in selecting new suppliers. Thus, it is of concern for organizations to understand purchasing managers reaction to the influence of specific stakeholder groups when it comes to triple bottom line based supplier selection.  Following this notion we formulate hypotheses linking the organizations shareholder, public and customer orientation to the prevalence of sustainability and cost criteria in supplier selection decisions to be tested in a path analytical model. Based on the empirical results conducted with purchasing managers from large firms located in Germany, this paper makes two major contributions: first, it sheds light on direct effects of shareholder, public, and customer orientation on the evaluation of the outlined-trade off; second, it investigates the indirect effects by introducing the formalization of ethical culture as a mediating variable to assess the impact of the three kinds of shareholder orientation on the propensity to select suppliers based on their performance in terms of social and environmental criteria as well as cost performance.",sustainablility| supplier selection| path analysis

While academic studies on Lean methods are widespread, research on effective behavior in Lean operations is still rare. To date there have been  few scholarly studies that reported on behavioral predictors of Lean organizing. In this review paper we analyze them; careful search- and selection effort uncovered ten empirical Lean studies with a team-behavioral focus; they are methodologically diverse and offer various lenses. Given this small set of original studies, we supplemented our review of Lean team studies with relevant results of the much older and more established team-effectiveness literature. Nine Lean team human dynamics were uncovered, consisting of affective, behavioral and/or cognitive factors that build upon and reinforce each other in a delicate balance. It appears that a Lean team culture is hand-crafted, over time: when team members engage in Lean practices that are helping them to reflect on their own work habits so that they can improve their routines. Moreover, variables that figure prominently in effective team contexts, such as voice behavior or customer-related output variables, have not been included in the reviewed Lean team studies. Thus, this systematic review of the available empirical Lean team behavior studies opens up new research paths for testing the various theoretical linkages between effective Lean management, group behavior at the shop-floor level and organizational/group culture/climate theory, including enablers of effective Lean work-group behavior.",lean operations| team/group effectiveness| culture/climate

Our study is conducted at the plant-level using 13 years of process compliance data obtained from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We pair plants that have adopted ISO 9000 with similar plants that did not. These matches are created based on industry, ownership status (public/private), plant size, and whether the plant is the only establishment in the company. We then compare average compliance levels after ISO 9000 certification between the matched sets of certified and non-certified plants. Results from our analyses indicate that, on average, only early adopters of ISO 9000 had better process compliance during the period following adoption as compared to their matched non-adopters. We also find moderate evidence that process compliance among these early adopters deteriorated over time after certification. These results are consistent with phenomena predicted by institutional theory and the organizational forgetting view in the adoption of best practice interventions, and they help to resolve inconsistencies found in the extant literature on the performance effects of adopting ISO 9000.",iso 9000| quality control| organizational learning

Our results indicate that 5 of the 11 influence tactics identified in the prior literature, i.e., collaboration, consultation, ingratiation, inspirational appeals, and rational persuasion, are significant and strong predictors of employee commitment to continuous improvement initiatives.  Further, analyses show that these influence tactics are significant drivers of the quality of the supervisor-subordinate relationship, which was found to partially mediate the relationship between influence tactics and the perceived effectiveness of the supervisor in implementing continuous improvement projects.",continuous improvement| influence tactics| task commitment

On the one hand, they are claimed to be inflexible and thus detrimental when used in dynamic operating environments. On the other hand, their integrated databases enable swift cross-functional information flows, which are said to be critical for survival in dynamic environments. These two contradicting arguments are frequently made in the practitioner literature, yet both of them can also be based on the organization-theoretical literature: Organic Theory implies that ERP systems should be detrimental in dynamic environments while Information Processing Theory suggests that they should be advantageous. In this study, we use cross-sectional survey data from 151 manufacturing plants to determine which argument is more applicable in the context of manufacturing planning and control. The results are strongly in favor of one of the arguments and thus provide a direct answer to practitioners facing this topical question. To facilitate the future reconciliation of the two contradicting arguments, the paper also discusses how the findings could have been influenced by three contextual factors: namely, the technical nature of the studied system, the mechanic responses to changes in the studied context, and the interconnectedness of the studied activities.",operations management-information systems interface| strong inference| contingency theory

Examining a longitudinal, international sample of pharmaceutical manufacturing plants, we find that cultural distance does relate to decreased process compliance, on average, but that it does not affect the rate of decay in compliance. We also find that the only cultural dimension with a direct effect on process compliance performance is plant-level power distance.

Taxonomies of buyer-supplier relationships (BSRs) are useful for managers since they provide information about the potential value of selected relationships and their inherent opportunities and problems. This paper develops a taxonomy of how buyers and suppliers combine the different learning processes underlying AC. Cluster analysis was used to develop these BSRs patterns, which were analyzed in terms of AC strength and AC reinforcement. Analysis of variance was used to explore the relationships between type of BSR and firm performance in terms of innovation and operative efficiency. The results provide evidence of a significant relationship between the BSRs patterns (typified as strong AC, medium AC, weak AC and balanced AC) and firm performance and highlight the importance of AC for BSRs.

A multiple, longitudinal case study method is used to examine the manifold interactions between formal and informal governance mechanisms and inter-organizational conflicts over a 15-year period.  The paper extends previous results by offering a more fine-grained understanding of the interplay between conflict types and governance mechanisms. First, inter-organizational conflict appears in at least four distinct but inter-related forms  relationship, task, process and governance. Second, it is various interactions between conflict types which have an impact on overall relationship performance. The implication of this study is that, to the extent that task and process conflict may be encouraged while relationship and governance conflict should be restrained to realize overall relationship performance. Finally, the need for coordination through formal and informal governance mechanisms in these long-term relationships adds another layer of complexity when considering the impact of conflicts on relationship performance.",inter-organizational conflicts| long-term relationship governance| longitudinal multiple case study

In this research, we test how three dimensions of social context  dyadic gender composition, negotiation strategy, and trust  interact to influence one micro-ethical decision, the use of deception, in a simulated negotiation.  To create an opportunity for deception, we incorporated an indifference issue  an issue that had no value for one of the two parties  into the negotiation.  Deception about this issue was least likely to be affected by trust or negotiation strategy in all-male dyads, suggesting that dyads with at least one female negotiator were more sensitive to social context than all-male dyads.  In mixed-sex and all-female dyads, trust and negotiation strategy interacted to affect the use of deception.   A consistent picture emerged in mixed-sex dyads, which increased their use of deception when three forms of trust (affective, benevolent, deterrent) were low and negotiators used an accommodating strategy.   However, a more complex pattern emerged in all-female dyads.   When negotiators in all-female dyads competed, low benevolence-based trust increased whereas low deterrence-based decreased deception.   When negotiators in all-female dyads accommodated, high affect-based trust increased deception.   Jointly, these findings suggest that in all-female dyads, negotiators use multiple and shifting reference points in deciding when to deceive the other party.",gender| ethics| trust

To explore this question, we conducted three studies examining the effect of negotiation issue on gender differences in negotiation performance, propensity to initiate negotiation and the decision to opt-out of a negotiation. Across three studies, men performed better and were more likely to negotiate than women when the negotiation concerned masculine issues.  However, these gender differences were either eliminated or reversed when participants negotiated over feminine issues.

This research goes beyond the historically predominant view by incorporating two important conceptsstatus distance and status distance changeand demonstrates that variance along these dimensions predicts behavior even while rank-based differences are held constant. Specifically, three studies show that status distance and change together can promote damaging group member behaviors (i.e., social undermining, information withholding) that cannot be explained by ordinal differences alone. As predicted, certain combinations of status distance and change also elicit a threat of status loss, which in turn provoke behaviors that can harm other members performances and the group overall.

I propose that although power confers the psychological and social freedom to dissent, the process of attaining power makes individuals unlikely to see the need to do so.  I suggest that advancing to a position of power may lead individuals to adopt the morality embedded in the group, decreasing the likelihood that high power individuals will view existing practices as lacking in morality and therefore, reducing the likelihood that they will dissent.  In a laboratory study, I find evidence that advancing in a hierarchy socializes individuals, resulting in greater identification with the group and therefore, less dissent.  In an archival survey study of employees in U.S. federal government agencies, I find evidence that higher power is associated with lower odds of reporting that one has observed unethical activity and therefore, less dissent.  However, consistent with current knowledge of power, when individuals do view existing practices as lacking in morality, higher power is associated with greater expression of dissent.

Building on research from organizational studies and social psychology, we examine how the experience of power both affects leadership behavior and influences the extent to which leaders are likely to tailor their behavior based on their perceptions of followers desires. We argue that power elicits more task-focused than relationship-focused leadership behavior because power induces in individuals an assumption that followers prefer task-focused leadership. However, power also increases individuals abilities to respond to information about what followers desire, making them better able to switch from their default task-focus to a relationship-focus when necessary. Consequently, power enhances the ability to lead strategically. Four studies find support for our arguments. The implications for theory and practice are discussed.",power| leadership| persuasion

Few institutions have historically presented more defined gender boundaries than the military. Nonetheless, women have made substantial progress over the past forty years, providing support for the likelihood of advances towards greater equality, even in the most traditionally masculine environments. On the other hand, evidence suggests that that substantial progress has slowed in recent years.  The continued formal exclusion of women from branches most likely to lead to career advancement, as well as continued exposure to sexual harassment and assault, are mechanisms that inhibit further progress. Pervasive masculine hegemony (Connell & Messerschmidt, 2005) and the highly gendered nature of the military organization (Britton, 2000; Acker, 1990; Silva, 2008) may provide an explanation for institutional resistance to profound change. Cecilia Ridgeway (2011) attempts a synthesis of these views.  She outlines institutional and other modernizing social forces that enhance womens progress.  At the same time she recognizes multigenerational patterns of gender framing that act as a break to full inequality.  Using Department of Defense surveys, promotion, harassment and assault data, as well as a literature review of current events, I explore how forces enabling and inhibiting progress co-exist in modern organizations.

Study 1 and 2 demonstrate that psychological stigma occurs and leads to hiring biases, holding constant qualifications and minimizing unemployment duration. Moreover, rationales indicating the controllability of unemployment-onset (i.e., voluntarily left vs. laid-off), a causal dimension that has been found to mitigate negative responses toward stigma in past research, did not alleviate stigma. This may have occurred because of perceivers fundamental tendency to overemphasize internal/dispositional explanations for target outcomes.

Intimate partner violence (IPV) is an example of an invisible stigma.  The decision about whether or not to disclose IPV victimization can have implications for the affected employee and organization.  In addition to safety concerns, disclosure of IPV victimization can provide numerous benefits.  In this paper, we seek to answer the question what factors contribute to disclosure of IPV victimization at work?  Using a sample of almost 500 IPV victims from four organizations, we test the relationship between IPV disclosure and (1) stigma characteristics, (2) anticipated consequences, and (3) coworkers and family support. We find that IPV victims are more likely to disclose when experiencing higher levels of abuse, when an incident of violence occurs at work, and when coworkers are supportive.

Threat of stigmatization is a stressor that can lead to strains. Certain responses to stigma threat (coping strategies) may also play a fundamental role in the strain process. We hypothesized that threat of stigmatization based on chronic illness would relate to job-induced tension and absenteeism, and that these relationships would be mediated by work-related engagement and disengagement coping. Additionally, we identified two potential moderators of these mediated relationships: work centrality and continuance commitment. We surveyed 315 individuals who were working at least 30 hours per week and had at least one chronic illness or health condition. As expected, stigmatization threat significantly related to both job-induced tension and absenteeism. Also, work-related engagement coping mediated the relationship between stigma threat and job-induced tension, and work-related disengagement coping mediated the relationship between stigma threat and absenteeism. However, disengagement coping did not mediate the relationship of stigma threat and job-induced tension. No support for moderated mediation was found for either work centrality or continuance commitment, but continuance commitment did moderate the relationship between stigma threat and disengagement coping (a stronger relationship between stigma threat and disengagement coping was found at higher levels of continuance commitment).

Further analyses demonstrated that with increasing age, preferences to change the content of the work or the context of the work decrease. Contrarily, employees with a higher education have the preference for a work-profile with modified work content and have higher preference to work in another work context after their retirement.

The current study builds on this theory to consider two additional mechanisms that may impact racial/ethnic minorities ascension to top leadership positions: the bold move thesis and the savior effect. Contrary to the glass cliff, the bold move thesis posits that minorities are more likely to be promoted when firms are strong, while the savior effect suggests minority leaders are more likely to be replaced by traditional white male leaders during times of struggling performance. To test the relevance of these factors for racial/ethnic minorities we analyze all CEO transitions among Fortune 500 companies over a twenty year period. Our findings do not support the glass cliff theory. In fact, people of color are more likely to be appointed to strongly-performing firms. Our findings do show strong support for the savior effect thesis however. When minority leaders are appointed, a decline in firm performance increases the chance that these leaders are replaced by more traditional white male leaders.

The present study proposed and examined the application of an index that can be used by universities to more easily monitor this situation, which may help bring additional attention to the problem. Two universities participated in the study and results indicated that the index is helpful for monitoring changes in equity over time within a university as well as differences across universities.",gender equity| university| glass funnel

We draw attention to one possible proactive organizational response  the incorporation of diversity in organizational identity.  Necessarily, this initial response evokes subsequent tasks of managing the changed identity. Therefore, the paper also addresses the management of diversity identity within organizations, and relevant organizational outcomes. Our theoretical model is grounded in institutional theory and we propose that the management of diversity identity can impact both perceptions of legitimacy as well as diversity identity. Adequate, inadequate and optimal management of diversity identity has differential effects on legitimacy and diversity identity. We contribute to the literature by a) unbundling initial and later firm responses to promoting diversity at the organizational level, and b) by offering a more nuanced understanding of the complexities of managing diversity identity within organizations.",diversity identity| institutional theory| legitimacy

Exploring Differences in Diversity Judgments and Their Consequences,"1|Christopher W Bauman|U. of California, Irvine||2|Sophie Trawalter|U. of Virginia||",,"People often treat diversity as an objective feature of situations that everyone perceives similarly. However, diversity judgments may diverge because they are social perceptions that reflect, in part, individuals motives and experiences, such as concerns about how a group would treat them. Therefore, whether a group includes in-group members should predict how diverse a group appears, even if it is heterogeneous in other ways. Supporting this idea, two experiments demonstrated that racial minority group members perceived more diversity when groups included members of their own race rather than another. This in-group representation effect was more pronounced among African Americans than Asian Americans and positively associated with strength of racial identification. Furthermore, variability in perceived diversity had important consequences for racial minority group members; across conditions that Whites rated as being equally diverse, perceived diversity explained differences in organizational attractiveness and expectations about how effectively the group would handle racial issues.",perceived diversity| race| organizational attractiveness

Findings indicate that when Whites report low racioethnic identification, they evaluate candidates dissimilar to them (i.e., Blacks) more favorably in terms of both likeability and trust than candidates who are similar to them. When Whites report high racioethnic identification, they evaluate candidates similar to them more favorably in terms of likeability, trust, physical attractiveness, and willingness to hire than candidates who are dissimilar to them.

Results indicate that senior leaders need for flexibility as well as their usage of flexibility options are both positively associated with work-to-home interference, while such interference is decreased when employees perceive their company as supportive and understanding of their nonwork responsibilities.  Results also indicate that senior leaders who perceive that their organization is not meeting their needs with their flexibility policies are less committed to the organization as a whole.  Finally, a heartening finding of the present research is that supervisors are not more likely to give negative performance reviews to employees who have greater work-life flexibility needs, or to employees who make regular use of organizational flexibility policies.

These studies have focused on patterns of gender inequality in organizational advancement, often concluding that there exist ""glass ceilings"" barring women from obtaining high-status, or management positions. As women continue to gain access to these organizational roles, however, it becomes increasingly important to understand the effects that women in management have on both organization- and individual-level outcomes. Specifically, what effects do female managers have on the gender inequality of the employees reporting to them? There exists suggestive evidence that women in positions of power may reduce gender inequality in the workplace. While a few studies have attempted to explore this relationship, none have examined actual manager-subordinate relationships to determine the effects of female managers on gender inequality. Using a unique, longitudinal data set from a large retail bank, I construct these reporting relationships to better understand the broader implications of womens presence in management positions. This first direct examination of the relationship between the presence of women in management and the gender inequality of non-managerial employees indicates that while there are implications for subordinates to having women in management, there do not appear to be direct implications for gender inequality in terms of wages or job allocation. There is some evidence, however, that male and female manages differ in the rates that they offer flexible work arrangements to their subordinates.",gender inequality| women in management| homophily

This paper seeks to answer two research questions. First, how does perceived demographic similarity (i.e. sex similarity) among coworkers affect job attitudes (i.e. job satisfaction and organizational commitment) through the mediation effect of coworker support? Second, does the creative requirement of various jobs influence the relationship among coworker support and job attitudes? To answer these research questions, the National Employee Survey (NES) is used which contains a sample of 1160 full-time employees. The results indicated that employees who are similar to their coworkers with respect to their sex receive more coworker support than those who are not similar to their coworkers. In addition, coworker support mediates the relationship between perceived sex similarity and both job satisfaction and organizational commitment. Furthermore, as predicted, coworker support is more strongly correlated with job satisfaction for those jobs that have high creative requirements compared to jobs that require low levels of creativity. However, the moderation effect of creative requirement on organizational commitment is not supported. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings and potential future research directions are discussed.",sex similarity| coworker support| creativity requirement

The framework presented looks at the presence of dissent as a moderator in the team diversity and innovation relationship.

To explain these negative reactions, self-interest framework where reactions are driven by the beneficiary status has been frequently invoked. However, inconsistent results have emerged by showing that beneficiaries, despite being the ones to benefit from such policies, can react negatively - seemingly suggesting a self-interest framework may be invalid. To account for these anomalous findings, we broaden the conceptualization of self-interest to include preserving a positive self-image as a special type of self-interest which can result in positive or negative reactions to EE policies, for both nonbeneficiaries and beneficiaries. In particular, EE policies expose nonbeneficiaries to the image-threatening suggestion that their success is due to external factors, while exposing beneficiaries to the image-threatening risk of failing to obtain employment despite being given advantages by EE policies. Across three studies, we showed that self-image threat influences reactions to EE policies in the context of gender-based EE policies. Using experimental designs, we demonstrate both that EE policies threaten the self-images (Study 1) and that self-affirmations mitigate the negative reactions of both men (nonbeneficiaries) and women (beneficiaries; Study 2). Using a field correlational design, we found that that those least likely to experience self-image threat when faced with a gender-based EE policy  women with high interviewing self-efficacy  were also the most likely to show positive reactions to EE policies (Study 3).

Results from an experimental study show that lower status HWR participants were more negatively evaluated in competence and were subsequently less likely to be considered for promotion, compared to their identical counterparts not involved in such a relationship. Significantly, lower status men in a HWR were affected more negatively than lower status women.

Our qualitative analysis, however, indicate that social skills, which are often associated with women, are utilized as strategies to attain senior managerial roles by men. This raises not only the question of how social skills are valued but also what skills are discursively gendered and who benefits from enacting them. In drawing on evolutionary theory, social role theory, and cognitive theories of gender development, we interviewed managers to determine strategies they undertook to seek career advancement. We also took a culture-centred approach to determine if cultural factors influenced their decisions. While we found no cultural differences between men and womens strategies, we did find important distinctions between the types of strategies utilized by men and women. Females emphasized strategies such as education and support from family and friends, and socially-orientated attributes that demonstrate passion, patience and persistence in their jobs. Conversely, males emphasized formal and informal networking, and active involvement in industry associations. From these findings, we assert that a gender dynamic associated with skill attribution continues to exist in the workplace and men benefiting more so than women from enacting social behaviours.Paper is No Longer Available Online: Please contact the author(s).In the current paper we first propose that individuals might be inclined to believe that women have difficulty working with one another professionally, though this notion is far from being substantiated empirically.

However, the literature is unclear as to why some trainees benefit from SBT more than others. To address this gap, we conducted three studies involving area experts and graduate management students with a range of individual differences in the US and Australia, using a pre/post-test experimental design. The results suggest that SBT: (1) enhances trainees declarative knowledge only in cases of successful performance in the simulation, and an appropriate gap (discussed in the paper) between the trainees prior knowledge and the challenges presented by the simulator, and (2) energizes trainees learning processes only in cases of success in the simulation, high prior knowledge level, and positive prior attitude towards SBT. These findings advance existing theory by revealing the boundaries of SBT effectiveness, and identifying individual differences that, if taken into account, may improve its value. Practical implications suggest that SBT designers should integrate various levels of difficulty into the design and lecturers ensure that trainees possess the required theoretical knowledge before the SBT session.Paper is No Longer Available Online: Please contact the author(s).Many studies have indicated that Generation Y is more multimedia oriented than were previous generations of students, and it is generally agreed that students from Generation Y prefer multimedia tools in the classroom.

Modern cross-cultural training has embraced CQ and a few general CQ education approaches have recently emerged. However, given these general approaches, relatively little work has empirically investigated specific processes by which increased CQ capacity can most effectively be achieved via these educational and developmental efforts. This study fills that gap by specifying a process in which experiential contact with members of a different cultural group can contribute to the development of an individuals ability to effectively function in culturally diverse contexts. The hypothesized model, grounded in contact theory and experiential learning research, proposes that contact type influences the development of cultural intelligence (CQ) by means of disconfirmation and an increase in stereotype awareness and alteration. The process was tested in a theoretically-based CQ education program with management students and professionals.

Our qualitative study is based on 29 interviews with faculty and administrators at 14 business schools and one industry expert. We identify four domains  Constituents, Context, Constraints and Genuine Identity  which business schools consider when exploring a potential curricular change. We present a Model of Successful Curricular Change that recognizes attention to these inputs, in terms of both focus and capacity, affects the type of change the organization pursues. This model also takes into account the mediating effect of faculty tolerance for the discomfort on curricular change. Finally, we surface an Attentional Theory of Change that posits change is a function of the choices an organization makes regarding which inputs they attend to. This theory states that in order to achieve significant and meaningful change, organizations must attend to aligning the most important and relevant inputs. The findings contribute to our understanding of change processes in business schools and higher education, and, potentially, to change processes in organizations.",attentional change| mba curriculum| tolerance for discomfort

Burke|U. of Tennessee, Chattanooga||",,"Human capital management (HCM) is an important managerial competency domain yet it remains underemphasized in college of business curricula (Rubin & Dierdorff, 2011) to the detriment of students, managers, and ultimately, organizations. Rubin and Dierdorff (2011) have called upon management educators to find ways to address the HCM deficiency in business education. In this paper, we argue that mastery of HCM requires the development of competency at the individual level (e.g., coaching, mentoring, communication, conflict resolution), organizational level (e.g., strategic planning, hiring, compensating and rewarding), and the environmental level (e.g., understanding demographic, economic, social, political, and legislative trends). The current approach of most colleges of business is to address this critical behavioral competency with a single course in organizational behavior. While important for addressing the individual level, this single course is simply insufficient to address the complexity of the HCM competency domain. We argue that an additional required course in human resource management (HRM) offers considerable potential for further developing the HCM competency of students. We discuss how HRM can address the deficiency and conclude with some thoughts on how management faculty can bring HRM into the business core.",business education| managerial competency| human resource management

A taxonomy of workplace communication skills is put forth delineating different types of communication.  We then review literature and show that oral communication is among the most important skills in the workplace.  Given that oral communication is a multidimensional construct, we develop a typology that differentiates five types of oral communication based on communication interactivity and purpose.  A review of the literature shows that listening is the most important type of oral-communication for workplace performance followed by reference, persuasive, bargaining, and presenting, respectively.  Next, the learning goals of U. S. undergraduate business programs, accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business, were content analyzed.  The results indicate that 76% of the business programs have an oral-presentation learning goal and less than 15% had a goal related to other types of oral communication.  Our research shows that there is a marked misalignment between the oral-communication skills that are needed in the workplace compared to those that are emphasized in business curricula.  We offer potential reasons for the misalignment and offer suggestions for closing the gap.",oral communication| management education

College Dublin||2|Peter McNamara|U. College Dublin||,,"Our study looks at the tension between embedded agency and social structure through the lens of structuration theory and explores the ability of individual actors to make strategic decisions in a deterministic environment. Skilled performance of individual actors is central to the interplay between structure and action in organizations. This paper examines both structure-driven and agency-driven antecedents of such performance. We analyzed the careers of 391 business school academics and explored how early-career anchoring disadvantages that result in lower level of symbolic capital (e.g. as a consequence of a lower rank of academic origin) can be mitigated by subsequent adjustment that generates social capital (e.g. the network of co-authors) and how the accumulation of these two types of capital reflects upon individual research performance. Our findings demonstrate that structure and agency perspectives can be complimentary, rather than conflicting views of the process of career development and also that initial conditions, whilst important, need not be entirely deterministic to the long term career productivity of a knowledge intensive professional career such as an academic. These results have meaningful implications for global academic community as they suggest more pro-active nature of success in academic career.",academic productivity| agency| structuration

Rundshagen|Cologne Business School||,,"The German higher education (HE) sector is in transition. Private business schools are taking off in a boom phase, looking for vast growth opportunities within a political environment fostering market forces. However, they face a dilemma resulting from a still constraining regulatory framework on the one hand, and intensifying competition among private and even with public institutions on the other hand. There are first doubts if the business model of private management education is as prosperous as anticipated. This paper addresses the hitherto neglected perspective of private HE institutions as businesses, and in particular the gap of research into German private business school strategy. A model is proposed to that end, and the four potentially beneficial strategic positions called volume caretaker, low-touch utilitarian, intensive utilitarian, and elite builder are derived and discussed. The importance of clearly profiled institutions is emphasized, in order to prevent two adverse future scenarios of this market: firstly, the domination of barely viable, isomorphic institutions, resulting in mediocre results for all stakeholders of business education in Germany; or secondly a business school bubble eventually bound to collapse.",strategic positioning| private business schools| german higher education

Based on survey data underlying the Beyond Grey Pinstripes (BGP) ranking we find: (1) that most courses covering ethics content, and especially standalone ones, are electives, (2) that integration of ethical issues into the curriculum focuses on a few selected disciplines, and (3) that over time schools increase the absolute number of courses, however without changing their core/elective status and their affiliation with selected disciplines. We argue that these results point towards a problem: business schools increasingly risk creating a gap between their upbeat rhetoric around ethics education and their actual curriculum. We explain why our findings imply such decoupling and suggest that, given the persistence of ethical problems in todays business environment, more mandatory ethics courses as well as a stronger integration of ethics-related debates in disciplines like finance and accounting are needed. We claim that decoupling is likely to emerge because business schools face a conflict between increasing external institutional pressures to legitimize their MBA programs and internal impediments to fully integrate ethics education into the curriculum.",ethics education| business schools| mba programs

Study findings show a demographic range, such as: nationality, level of religiosity, and political attitudes, and indicate that three of these socio-demographic variables predict commitment to the profession at the onset of academic studies: psychometric score, level of religiosity, and previous academic learning experience. In addition, in order to isolate those students who come to study mainly in order to acquire academic education, the findings indicate two profiles of novice students: First are the students who choose to study social work out of a desire to bring about social change; who recognize the importance of the professional, individual and community activities of the profession; and who are committed to the profession. In contrast, there are also students who choose to engage only in individual treatment in the future; who are not committed to the profession in its essence, but rather recognize the importance of its professional individual activities only.

Among the criticisms is the notion that traditional lectures fail to lead students to connect course concepts to addressing the real world challenges they (will) face in the workplace. A related critique, from the educational literature, is that information is rarely converted into usable knowledge until students grapple with applying it. King (1993) advocated the use of teaching techniques indicative of being a guide on the side, to complement their more traditional role as a sage on the stage. We build upon the ideas of King (1993) and others (e.g., Mintzberg, 2004; Schein, 1999, 2009) to outline two sets of complementary pedagogical assumptions and foci that define teaching in the roles of a rockstar and a ringmaster.

Through a phenomenological qualitative inquiry carried out at a UK University where the use of participant-produced drawings were piloted in an evaluative context, three key areas for consideration with regards to enhancing the evaluation of undergraduate provision in management education were identified; (1) giving students space to emotionally respond to their learning (2) acknowledging the temporal aspect of student learning and (3) offering students the opportunity to set and shape the evaluative agenda. Participant-produced drawing is offered as a confluent method of evaluation that is appreciative of the cognitive-affective learning theoretical debate (Buissink-Smith et al, 2011; Sitzmann et al, 2010; Armstrong & Fukami, 2010; Shephard, 2004) and the rapidly changing nature of higher education practice (Molesworth et al, 2011; Cuthbert, 2010; Modell, 2005; Bok, 2004)..

This relationship holds across a range of disciplines, countries, institutional settings and data. Most studies have been observational limiting the causal inferences which can be drawn, few have controlled for background ability and motivation leading to questions about omitted variable bias, and almost none have investigated the impact of implemented attendance policies upon academic outcomes. This article makes two important contributions. First, this paper exploits the difference-in-difference estimator and the discontinuity created by the introduction of a tutorial attendance policy. An implicit assumption of the existing evidence base is that policies aimed at reducing absenteeism will result in improved marks. The second contribution of this paper is to test this assumption using data collected before and after the introduction of such a policy on the B.Sc. in Business Management in the Department of Management, Kings College London.

For the first time, we argue that this strategy, which we term multiple equivalent simultaneous offers (MESOs), will yield greater gains for the offerer because recipients will perceive MESOs as a more legitimate first offer, leading them to adjust less from MESOs initial positions as they make counteroffers and reach agreement. The first experimental tests of MESOs supported predictions, revealing greater gains for the offerer (Study 13) because recipients perceived MESOs to be more legitimate (Study 3) and adjusted less from the offers initial positions (Studies 1, 2, 3). Also, MESOs led to greater joint gain (Study 1, 2) because it began the negotiation with a more efficient starting point (Study 2).

This lack of cooperation allows men with greater facial ratios to claim more value when negotiating with other men, but inhibits their ability to discover creative agreements that benefit everyone at the bargaining table. Facial ratios also predict negotiators' reputations, such that men with greater facial ratios are perceived to be more competitive and less cooperative than those with smaller facial ratios.",negotiation| facial structure| sexual selection

Study 2 examined how managing expectancies about counterparts anger would alleviate the deleterious effects of face threat sensitivity in negotiations. The results indicated that counterparts anger expressions had less of a negative effect on high face threat sensitivity negotiators feelings about self when the counterpart confirmed as opposed to violating expectancies. Taken together, the results demonstrated that feelings about self should be taken into account when examining the effects of face threat sensitivity on negotiators attitude toward the relationship, concession making, and individual outcome. Further, we showed that managing expectancies about counterparts anger mitigated the negative effects of face threats on high face threat sensitivity negotiators feelings about self.

We propose a behavioral theory of negotiation that expands the role of reciprocity in negotiations outside these bounded encounters to influence motives negotiators bring to the bargaining table and implementation. We model a negotiator who opens and maintains relational accounts that enable reciprocity over time and circumstance. In a series of laboratory studies, we manipulated exchange scenarios to test emotional reactions, social motives and implications for negotiations. The first two studies showed that different exchange scenarios shifted individual social preferences. This effect was mediated by emotional responses and extended to bargaining behavior. Study 3 confirmed these effects in more complex, multi-issue negotiations. Relational accounting for reciprocity is the foundation for building a behavioral theory of negotiation.",negotiation| social motives| emotion

Newman Award Nominee||,"The purpose of this paper is to analyze how processes of institutionalization of strategic planning in organizations affect middle management behavior in planning and therefore strategic adaptiveness of the organization. In specific, we analyze consequences of institutionalization of strategic planning processes on the mindfulness of involved middle managers. We first identify a typology of three practices of middle managers enacting strategic planning representing different stages of mindfulness: conforming, decoupling, and shaping. Considering behavioral effects of institutionalization, we propose that low degrees of institutionalization of strategic planning processes foster practices of shaping which are a prerequisite for strategic adaptiveness. Contrary, higher degrees of institutionalization seem to foster less mindful practices such as blind conformance and decoupling behavior which might endanger that organizations are able to formulate adequate strategies and might impede necessary changes in the planning process itself.Paper is No Longer Available Online: Please contact the author(s).We argue for taking a more distinguished view on the time-framing of strategic issues and that responding to long-term issues presents a distinct decision process characterized by a multitude of peculiarities as a low perceived urgency for strategic action and a high perceived uncertainty.

Using the case of coopetition, we develop and apply a theoretical framework of practicing paradox in a case study of supplier networks in the automobile industry. Our findings distinguish four different types of practicing paradoxes, two of a more passive nature (i.e. ritualizing and normalizing) and two of a more proactive nature (i.e. pragmatizing and euphemizing).

As a response to that, organizations are increasingly engaging in inter-organizational sensemaking activities in order to develop a collective understanding of the meta-problems to inform their intra-organizational attempts at dealing with them. In this paper, we propose to conceptualize such inter-organizational strategizing processes as scaffolding of sensemaking capacities. Based on a longitudinal case study of a multi-sector industry initiative concerned with the meta-problem of water as an environmental resource constraint, we explore the different practices and patterns in which individual organizations extend their respective sensemaking capacities. We identify three categories of extension practices (scaffolding practices, conduct practices, transfer practices) and three patterns of extension (extension for triggering sensemaking, complementary extension, selective extension). Overall, we contribute to the literature on strategy-as-practice, the wider sensemaking literature and the literature on inter-organizational strategy.",inter-organizational strategizing| sensemaking capacity| scaffolding

We identify three additional roles of middle managers, those of: relationship builder, conceptualizer and analyst.

Previous empirical and theoretical treatments of age and entrepreneurship have assumed homogeneity in the activity, downplaying existing knowledge about differences in the motives and aims underlying enterprising behaviour. The binary dependent variable in the analysis contrasts individuals who are thinking about starting a business but have not yet taken action, with those who are engaged in early-stage entrepreneurial activity. The multilevel analysis uses a sample of 2566 respondents from 27 European countries and includes control variables at the individual and the country levels. The results show that entrepreneurial activity increases almost linearly with age for individuals who prefer to only employ themselves (self-employers), whereas for those who aspire to invest in the business (owner-managers), the likelihood of enterprising activity increases until the individual reaches their late 40s, after which it decreases. Age has a considerably smaller effect on entrepreneurial behaviour for those who do not prefer self-employment but are pushed into it (reluctant entrepreneurs). These results partially support previous theorising on the effect of age on entrepreneurial behaviour based on the opportunity cost of time. At the same time, the results question the conventional wisdom of entrepreneurial activity declining in older ages and suggest that policy makers should consider the heterogeneity of entrepreneurial preferences more in order to optimise their response to demographic economic change.",age| entrepreneurship| self-employment

Stewardship theory rests on the premise that both principals and managers must choose to behave as stewards, thus allowing for potential performance to be maximized.  Stewardship theory further posits the election of stewardship behavior is facilitated by both situational and psychological characteristics.  We show how situational attributes of stewardship theory are present in a family firm environment (i.e., involvement-oriented management philosophy, collectivism, and low power distance) through distributive justice perceptions and participative decision making.  In turn these activities increase the likelihood of succession planning and extra role behavior, both of which contribute to family firm growth performance when explained through the psychological tenets of stewardship theory (i.e., intrinsic motivation, high identification, and personal power influence).",stewardship theory| family firms| performance

How entrepreneurs disclose the blemishes of a venture to investors may be a significant predictor of how much funding a venture receives. From this idea, this paper develops theory on commitment capabilities, a type of entrepreneurial capability concerned with the entrepreneurs ability to secure resources for his venture. I propose frank disclosure of the ventures problems (challenge admission) to be one behavior which leads to greater resource commitment. I hypothesize an inverted U-shaped relationship between the admission of problems and capital subsequently raised. Empirical analysis of the memoranda and business plans of 86 high-technology ventures supports this hypothesis. Plans and memoranda are found to have different effects.

I argue that given the different degree of specialisation in small and large firms, entrepreneurs emerging from small firms transfer knowledge from more diverse aspects of the business and create spinoffs more related to the main activity of the incumbent firm. Workers in large firms, however, benefit from higher returns to human capital that increase their opportunity costs to switch to an occupation that requires a different combination of skills. Since becoming an entrepreneur implies performing multiple tasks and makes part of their specialised skills unutilised, the minimum quality of the business idea at which they are willing to reveal the discovery is higher and, therefore, entrepreneurs emerging from large firms are of highest quality.",entrepreneurship| human capital| spinoffs

To explore the plausibility of this alternative explanation, versus the existing theories for the small firm effect, this paper examines the persistence of the small firm effect on new business survival and the founders post-entry occupational choice. Using employer-employee matched panel data obtained from Statistics Denmark, I find that the size of entrepreneurs prior employers continues to have a negative correlation with the survival of startups for the initial four years, but the size effect gradually fades away afterwards. The magnitude of the correlation is largely reduced if the new businesses were formed in sectors that are unrelated to founders parent firms. Moreover, entrepreneurs coming from small firms are much more likely to move into unemployment if their first startups did not survive. These results suggest that the higher rate of entrepreneurial spawning observed in small firms might be largely attributed to the existence of necessity entrepreneurs, while lower barriers of entry in sectors clustered by small firms and related industry experience further facilitate the transition into self-employment for small firm employees.",small firm effect| employee entrepreneurs| entry barrier

We postulate that research at the interface of HRM and CE requires a high fidelity lens and discuss the requirements of a theoretical framework that is broad enough to explain decision making in the CE context but parsimonious enough for practical application.",corporate entrepreneurship| human resource management| incentive theory

We ask whether the self-employed express their social responsibility to society by giving more to charity than the general population, and if so which charitable causes they give to. We use Social Identity Theory to generate hypotheses about the determinants and objectives of charitable behavior amongst members of this socially and economically important group. Testing these hypotheses with nationally representative, longitudinal US data, we find that the American self-employed are indeed more likely to exhibit social responsibility towards their community by giving to charities than the general population, even after including controls for other factors associated with charitable giving. While the self-employed support broadly similar charities to the general population, they give substantially more to organizations which address issues in the local community; provide health care; and serve the needy. We trace out implications of our findings for scholars, practitioners, and policy-makers.",small business| social responsibility| social identity theory

This paper examines mechanisms that give rise to entrepreneurial team and its structure. It focuses on two dimensions of team structure: size and diversity. We construct a simple model that formalizes the examination. It is found that an entrepreneur obtains less expected value from a project if the entrepreneur chooses to work solo at latter stage than working in a team. The effects of economic value, probability of failure, and cost of specialization on the timing of team formation are presented. It is shown that greater economic value increases the optimal team size and its diversity. It is also explained how asymmetry of importance between tasks in a commercialization project influences the decision of team formation and its optimal size.",entrepreneurship| team| new ventures

On the one hand, the value of the innovative idea under development by the early stage technology venture provides a meaningful bargaining position in contract negotiations. Thus, a more valuable innovative idea should generate larger promised remuneration for early stage technology firms upon signing an alliance agreement. However, established firms holding specialized complimentary assets can leverage those assets in such a way as to minimize the amount of money the early stage technology venture firm is likely to negotiate as part of the alliance contract. We examine the effects these two countervailing forces have on money promised to the early stage technology venture by the funding firm. Specifically, we believe the relationship between the value of the early stage venture's innovative ideas and the money it is promised as part of a collaborative effort is moderated by the levels of the funding firm's various specialized complementary assets. We use a sample of newly public biotech firms forming alliances with established pharmaceutical companies to test our hypotheses. We find, as predicted, the value of the new venture's innovative ideas tends to increase the amount of money negotiated in the alliance contract. We also find support for our contention that the strength of the funding firm's complementary assets negatively moderates this relationship.",alliances| entrepreneurship| funding

Employee turnover involves the departure of existing employees and the arrival of new employees. Employee departure takes away firm-specific knowledge, while new employee arrival brings in new information and knowledge. Cross-functional integration, as a knowledge transformation tool, reduces the loss of firm-specific knowledge due to employee departure, thus positively moderating the relationship between employee departure and innovation. However, decision complexity and divisional conflicts in cross-functional integration impedes newcomers transition to the firm, resulting in a negative moderation effect on the relationship between new employee arrival and innovation. We tested these hypotheses from panel data of 562 firms during eight years.",employee turnover| organizational innovation| cross-functional integration

We hypothesize that, rather than using rational decision-making approaches that consider all relevant information, business angels use heuristics that trade off accuracy for efficiency to reject opportunities early in the investment-decision process. We find that business angels use the achievement of certain aspiration levels for the investment return and investment risk to reject an opportunity, without making the predicted risk-return tradeoff.However, they appear to trade off among a set of criteria used to assess the investment return and among another set of criteria used to assess the investment risk.",business angel| investment decision| heuristic

This paper attempts to develop a conceptual framework to address the question: how do these specific Chinese USOs develop their innovation capabilities to build global products?In order to explore the idiosyncrasies of the specific USOs, this paper will use multiple case studies method following Yin (2003) and Eisenhardt (1989). The primary data sources were accessed through semi-structured interviews. In addition, archival data and other materials were used as secondary sources.The study analyses the configuration of capabilities that are needed for idiosyncratic growth, and maps them to the globalization processes. This paper provides a strategic !degroadmap!+- as an explanatory guide to entrepreneurs, policy makers and investors to better understand the phenomena. This paper will contribute to theories in three ways. Firstly, it will provide an insight into growing high-tech firms in a developing country that can compete globally on the basis of indigenous research. Second, it will shed light on the capabilities gap for Chinese USOs (as a subset of new technology based firms -- NTBFs) to access global markets.

We test our hypotheses using a unique inter-temporal cross country dataset developed by merging the General Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) with detailed national information about bankruptcy arrangement. We find that bankruptcy laws impact entrepreneurship through two different effects. Entrepreneurship is indeed discouraged by some elements of tough bankruptcy laws. However, harsher laws protecting creditor rights through allowing secured creditors to unilaterally seize secured assets and by giving secured creditors priority in the distribution of assets after bankruptcy is positively related to entrepreneurship and in particular high growth aspirations nascent entrepreneurship.

This could be due to the fact that in all these studies, networks have been taken to be uniplex in nature - a conduit for single type of content or it could be due to the belief that network structures, analyzed independently of what goes through them, can influence entrepreneurial and managerial outcomes. That some ties are multiplex in nature is known but little work has been done to explore the interaction between network structures and content in the management literature and none in an entrepreneurial setting. In this study we explore how the structure of the content of ties plays a role in entrepreneurial performance. By doing so, we extend the literature in three specific ways  first by focusing, on the structure of various multiplex ties, we attempt to reconcile the conflicting findings on the beneficial or detrimental effects of structural holes on performance.

While existing studies have stimulated interest in the potential importance of the phenomenon, little attention has been afforded to the actual process of portfolio entrepreneurship and the circumstances in which it arises. It has been argued that the context for portfolio entrepreneurship often hinges on understanding the family-business nexus, and requires a focus on both the family circumstances that may affect business decisions and also the economic conditions facing the business. The processes of portfolio entrepreneurship are likely to be complex and dynamic, bounded both by the structure and strategies of the industry sector and the personal decision making of the owners. The aim of this paper is to unpack the complexities of portfolio entrepreneurship processes, taking into account small businesses embeddedness in the entrepreneurial households. We seek to understand how and why some small family/household businesses end up as portfolio business clusters; the motivations and strategies behind such development; and how the portfolio of businesses is developed and managed by the household. To examine these questions, comparative case studies of portfolio enterprises were undertaken in Scotland and Norway. Three analytical themes emerged from the analyses: Inter-connectedness of business and household; family and kinship relations as business resource base; and risk, uncertainty and control. The discussion of these three themes seeks to contribute to further theoretical development in the field of portfolio entrepreneurship.",portfolio entrepreneurs| household/family| rural entrepreneurs

We show that gazelles are often outperformed by initially slower growing competitors, as they achieve lower employment growth, higher employee turnover, and lower survival rates in the long run. We explain this counterintuitive observation by arguing that high initial growth rates impede the emergence of a stable and efficient routine structure in the newly founded venture, if the expansion is undertaken too hastily. This in turn decreases their long- term performance, as the initial set of structures and routines, or the lack thereof, have a long-lasting effect on the organizations development.",employee turnover| gazelles| long-term performance

However, we also find resentment of entrepreneurship within academia and that distrust among academics complicate interactions, as academics are less open about their entrepreneurial interests and activities. In addition, we find that the technology transfer office (TTO) is both enabling and disabling the interaction.

Results show that ventures founded by men are more likely to possess greater total assets, compete in high-technology manufacturing industries, and locate in clustered regions compared to their female counterparts.  Further, firm resources, competing in high-technology manufacturing industries, and clustered regions are positively associated with both domestic and international firm performance.

While transaction costs cannot explain the emergence of firms in the market, the specialization perspective provides a promising approach to understanding the firms function in the market as well as its internal organization and capabilities.

Using venture capital (VC) investment data between 1985 and 2008, I found that syndicates with higher density are more likely to form in more competitive environments, in larger groups, in groups with greater heterogeneity, and in groups with stronger ties.

Specifically, we argue that in environments that are perceived as threatening, experience breadth is viewed by investors as a liability that inhibits focus and execution. In opportunistic environments we argue that experience breadth is viewed as a valuable resource. Results from an analysis of potential venture capitalist and angel investor evaluations of 168 new ventures in over 90 industries provide strong support for our hypotheses.

The evaluative legitimacies, pragmatic and moral, are argued to increase an organizations ability to gather resources, and also directly increase the organizations ability to implement social change through community member participation. On the other hand, it is argued that social entrepreneurship may not require, or benefit from, the unconscious cognitive legitimacy. Additional factors are proposed that, if present, will increase the potential for building legitimacy: pre-existent discord surrounding institutional norms in the local area; and active cooperation of both institutional insiders and outsiders that can be leveraged for social change. Based on a dialectical social theory on systems change, a model is presented of the opposing tensions between the evaluative and the unconscious, discord and consensus, institutional insiders and outsiders. By shifting focus from an uncontested view of the actions of social enterprise to one embedded in a highly resistant social system, we can begin to conceptualize the factors that can be leveraged to tip the system towards the actualization of new possibilities.",legitimacy| social entrepreneurship| dialectic theory

In addition, we explore how such differences influence heterogeneous entrepreneurial responses to the institutional environment, which in turn shapes their decision to exploit opportunities found in the informal rather than the formal economy. Our results suggest that low-income start-up entrepreneurs are mostly older, less educated, have less confidence in their skills and know fewer entrepreneurs than the high-income group, and are more likely to be female than higher income entrepreneurs.

Family logic enables family members acting as NV champions to more openly frame NV opportunities in terms of their personal preferences than non-family managers. When screening NV opportunities, sibling and cousin-consortium family firms are also more likely to compromise on economic criteria and give preference to nurturing family expertise and attachment logic.

Unlike previous studies of small groups seeking explanations for status inequalities via individual attributes, we argue that institutional logics strongly influence the business startup process and constrain female entrepreneurs possibilities of attaining higher status. Using a unique nationally representative sample of entrepreneurial teams from the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics II (PSED II), we identify two mechanisms by which institutional logics generate gender inequality. First, by creating and maintaining males advantages in attaining high status social positions, institutional logics about gender provide men with more opportunities for accumulating resources. Second, by defining appropriate roles for women and justifying the inferiority of female-stereotyped roles, institutional logics about gender suppress womens possibilities of attaining higher status, even when they have performed well.

Twenty six face-to-face interviews were conducted in India between October 2010 and November 2011. The results suggest that the process of return to India, and opportunity recognition and resource acquisition is a proactive, cognitive process, influenced by the perceived ability to start up a business, prior experience and the availability of and access to resources including social capital.

Building upon behavioral theory and socioemotional wealth perspectives, we extent this stream of literature by examining the effect of family ownership on different phases of the innovation process in SMEs. Data from 2,087 German family and non-family SMEs were used to structurally model and compare their innovation investment decision, their innovation outcomes and their labor productivity. The results provide substantial empirical support for our theoretical framework. Whereas family SMEs have a higher propensity to invest in innovation at all, conditional on investing in innovation, these firms do so less intensively than their non-family counterparts. Family SMEs further realize a similar level of product innovation output but achieve higher cost savings from process innovation. Given the level of product and process innovation, family SMEs underperform regarding labor productivity in comparison to their non-family counterparts.",family firm| innovation| sme

This paper examines the human capital present in independent PhVC firms offering a comparative analysis with that characterizing independent TVC firms. Results show that PhVC firms characterized by dual organizational identity exhibit similar utilitarian, economic oriented human capital as TVC firms, in that PhVC firms founders also have venture capital, finance, entrepreneurship, senior management, and/or consulting experience. PhVC firms also show higher normative, socially oriented human capital as their founders have higher levels of government, non-profit and social entrepreneurship experience than TVC firms.",social entrepreneurship| philanthropic venture capital

Being nascent, this literature has focused more on conceptual papers and a few empirical papers that show how such an identity plays a role in a new ventures quest for resources. However, yet to be examined is whether or not establishing an identity (Individuation action) significantly influences new-venture survival, and how doing so may be related to forming alliances (Ricardian actions) and introducing new products or services (Schumpeterian actions)  two other actions argued to be essential for survival. The study uses longitudinal archival data from US Internet Business-to-Business new ventures from 1999 to 2007 to address these research gaps. Overall, the study found that establishing an identity increases survival beyond the effect of the other actions, mediates the effect of forming alliances, and further interacts with the action to introduce new products or services in influencing survival. These findings suggest that not only establishing an identity matters for survival, but that these different types of actions also relate to one another in a rather intricate way.",new venture survival| new venture identity| competitive actions

This paper aims to study how growth as a business goal is accommodated into the identity construction of Finnish farmers and how the process is shaped by institutional forces. The results of a case study imply that both the institutional environment and social norms in particular contribute to differences identified in the sources of legitimacy applied by farmers. The traditional farmer pursues identity growth to achieve profitability within the boundaries of the accepted ways of operating a farm. The search for legitimacy reflects the local community. A passion for farming is the primary motivator, and growth is assumed to create wealth for the household. A different identity is that of the growth entrepreneur for whom the goal is to become the biggest and best regardless of social norms and the institutional environment. Decisions regarding the farm are taken for the good of the business irrespective of market trends or community expectations. Legitimacy is built on an interaction with both formal and informal institutions. Future research should study growth of farms more closely.",rural entrepreneurship| identity| legitimacy

It is argued that the rationale to participate in informal work is too complicated to be resolved in terms of economic motives alone. Evidence is drawn from 50 face-to-face interviews conducted with the households of one of the largest ethnic minority groups in the UK. Lending support to the school of post-structuralism, this article unveils certain implicit social constructs existing within the labour process of informal businesses. Motivations drawn from these social artifacts are found to be the prime reason for Pakistani employers and employees to engage in mutually beneficial deals of informal employment, undermining the impact of economic and structural variables. The agency related factors seem to provide better explanation for the prevalence of informal economic activity than the ones stemming from structural and regulatory conditions. However, in the end, it is only the interplay of various factors that can fully explain the intricate dynamics of informal employment amongst immigrant workers.",informal economy| immigrants| post-structuralism

Empirical research thus far has shown that both causal and creative modes of strategizing can lead to firm growth. In response to these ambiguous findings, this study analyzes whether the two strategies can also be combined and whether doing so affects firm growth. In order to do so, we decompose the two modes of entrepreneurial strategizing into smaller parts and analyze how entrepreneurs combine these parts and how this affects the growth of their firm.	Based on an analysis of the initial business plans of 108 micro and small firms we find that entrepreneurs indeed combine causal and creative strategies and that some combinations are more likely to lead to firm growth than others. These findings should help to better understand the role and effectiveness of distinctive modes of entrepreneurial strategizing such as causation, effectuation, discovery and creation.",entrepreneurial strategy| business plans| effectuation

Accordingly, much of the existing research on entrepreneurial learning has conceptualized learning as an individualized, isolated process operating apart from the wider socio-cultural context.  A social constructivist perspective of learning, however, emphasizes the key role that social interactions play in contributing to individual learning and development.  While many aspects of the entrepreneurial learning process have been previously explored, there is an insufficient understanding of the factors influencing the transfer of knowledge between individuals. This study looks at entrepreneurial learning through a social constructivist lens, exploring the transfer of opportunity identification process knowledge between 123 expert-novice pairs and identifying how this transfer is influenced by the concomitant effects of affect, cognition, and motivation.  We hypothesize and find that negative affect impacts both a novices ability to learnby impairing cognitive function in those using metacognitive abilitiesand their willingness to learnby either motivating novices high in creative self-efficacy or demotivating those low in creative self-efficacy.

We find that entrepreneurs who are harmoniously passionate about their work are better able to realize the benefits of networking. Specifically, they are more inclined to discuss work issues with fellow networking group members, which in turn increase the income they receive from peer referrals and, ultimately, their business income. Conversely, entrepreneurs with obsessive passion are less likely to be approached by peers in their networking group, receive less income from referrals, and have less business income compared to those who are not obsessively passionate about their work. The present findings highlight that passion does not always result in positive entrepreneurial outcomes  the type of passion one has makes a difference.

Based on the concept of socioemotional wealth, this study therefore aims to address this gap by focusing on family firms divestiture activity. Socioemotional wealth exerts a significant influence on the decision to divest; an inertia toward divestitures in family firms is the consequence.

Empirical investigation into availability cascades in the social sciences is limited, especially in contexts where decisions are made in the face of considerable uncertainty.  In this paper, we study the impact of availability cascades originating from two sources, the print and social media, in the context of technology-based entrepreneurship. First, we explore the conditions under which the rise of an availability cascade influences the nascent entrepreneurs decision to incorporate a firm in the specific technology domain experiencing the cascade. Second, we test the effect of the availability cascade on the time taken for a nascent entrepreneur in the specific technology domain experiencing a cascade to receive first-round funding from a venture capitalist. Our results show the positive effect of both the social media information cascade as well as the print media information cascade on firm founding and first-round funding. Additionally, we show that the social media cascade mediates the relationship between the print media cascade and firm founding / funding, thereby showing the agenda-setting nature of interactive social media in the context of technology entrepreneurship. We test these hypotheses on entrepreneurship data obtained from VentureXpert and the Census Bureau, augmented with social media data from the three largest blogging platforms and print media data from newspaper articles collected through the Internet between 1995 and 2007.  Our results provide evidence for the effect of availability cascades on the two decision-making contexts we address and also show support for the hypothesized mediation effect. Our work here is the first, to our knowledge, to show directly how social and print media may interact in influencing entrepreneurial decisions in a decentralized manner and also provides evidence on how social media plays an increasingly important role in agenda-setting in the economy.",entrepreneurship| availability cascades| social media

Empirical results indicate that the receipt of capital from financial institutions that provide both loan capital and technical assistance substantially increases the survival rate of nascent firms. In keeping with the resource-based view of the firm, we contend that technical assistance is a valuable and scarce resource for nascent firms, and that the technical assistance provided for protective reasons by community development lenders is an additional and advantageous resource that helps buttress the financial capital provided. Due to liabilities of newness and smallness, strategic and technical knowledge may potentially have a larger influence on performance for nascent firms.

This as yet unobserved tension in new ventures market entry decisions may bear fundamental consequences for emerging organizations. Hence, our study seeks to understand what primary types of organizational emergence exist with respect to market entry decisions and how these types evolve over time. Analyzing the emergence process of 25 new technology ventures, we found that different objectives and contexts push new ventures either towards a focused market entry approach or to a variety generating strategy, creating five distinct emergence types. Counter to the widespread assumption in organizational research, most of the firms which chose to pursue a single market opportunity at the outset changed their decision in subsequent stages to the variety generating approach.

We specifically focus on firm-level investments in general and specific human capital through wage levels and training costs. Our main premise is that higher levels of investments in general and specific human capital enhance labor productivity, which, in turn, is positively associated with the degree of internationalization of SMEs. However, we expect these effects to be contingent on the internationalization strategy of the firm. To test our ideas, we use a unique dataset of all manufacturing SMEs in Belgium which internationalized between 1998 and 2005 (n = 8,543 firm-year observations).  Consistent with our hypotheses, the findings indicate that investments in employee qualifications and training are critical for labor productivity and internationalization in fast internationalizers, but not for those firms which internationalize more slowly.

This contribution investigates opportunity-recognition beliefs among intentional and nascent student entrepreneurs in Germany. It applies a refined and extended version of the measure of opportunity-recognition beliefs proposed by Gregoire, Shepherd, & Schurer Lambert (2010). The results support the view that opportunity-recognition beliefs are not a unidimensional concept but consist of related but somehow distinct constructs. Determinants of opportunity-recognition beliefs are investigated using structural equation modeling. I find a negative direct effect of entrepreneurship education and a positive indirect effect, mediated by entrepreneurial self-efficacy. Previous work experience and venture gestation activities are also positively related to opportunity-recognition beliefs.

In this study, we integrate the literature on institutional entrepreneurship with research on industry emergence to trace how the institutional regime associated with a nascent industry in an emerging economy is established. We employ a detailed historical case narrative of the Indian mobile telephony industry to develop theoretical insights. Our findings draw attention to the contested and capricious nature of institutional change associated with industry formation. In such scenarios, the state is often involved in ""waves of institutionalization"" in order to establish the new institutional regime. These episodes of rule setting activity both increase the viability of the nascent industry and shape the contours of strategic activity that ensue within the sector, and can have the counterintutive effect of making it highly competitive and vibrant. Our observations highlight the state to be an integral yet conflicted and constrained institutional entrepreneur. Overall, our findings make contributions to the literatures on industry emergence and institutional change/entrepreneurship.",industry emergence| institutional entrepreneurship| mobile telephony

Since the unequivocal success factors generally studied, such as the management team, market, and product offering are often ambiguous at the time of evaluation, signaling theory would maintain that VCs likely substitute a number of alternative, objective signals that have yet to be considered. To demonstrate the potential of this approach, we introduce Higgans and Gulatis (2006) conceptualization of endorsement legitimacy as an unexplored signal that may influence VC investment decisions. In doing so, we draw on related disciplines and anecdotal evidence to suggest that varying levels of interorganizational associations and endorsements (i.e., the endorsement legitimacy) of a young venture may serve as an indicator of intrinsic venture quality - influencing the willingness of VC investment.  We also present a series of moderating propositions to delineate the boundary conditions around this posited relationship by suggesting that more idiosyncratic signals, such as endorsement legitimacy, become less important when greater information is known about the management team, or the munificence of the intended market, or the product offering. By illustrating how endorsement legitimacy may influence decisions through the lens of signaling theory, these findings, and their associated implications make a number of contributions to the literature. Broadly, this paper serves as an impetus to begin moving beyond the established funding determinants to a wider set of influential signals, bringing us one step closer to more comprehensively understanding the investment decision process in VC.",venture capital| endorsement legitimacy| decision making

The objective is to analyze the motivations variety and to explore how they relate to the companys organizational design. For that purpose, 22 cases have been studied and coded. It resulted in four types of entrepreneurial motivations and three Organizational Design (OD) dimensions that emerged after a first round of qualitative analysis. A cluster analysis of these 22 firms on motivations dimensions led to the identification of three configurations of entrepreneurial motivations and showed relationships between motivation and OD dimensions. This paper therefore makes three contributions: (1) it puts motivation back into a center stage position and relates it to OD, (2) it shows that entrepreneurial motivation should be apprehended as multi-dimensional level rather than analyzing each motivation separately, and (3) it complements the variety of motivation highlighted by one dimension distinctive of the CI: the teamwork motivation.",motivation| creative industries| entrepreneurship

We further argue that an important role for the organizational design is to facilitate interaction with external parties and achieve coordination among organizational members during opportunity exploitation. We advance that the combination of a high degree of both decentralization and the deployment of coordination represents such a design. Our analysis of a large double-respondent survey involving Danish private firms shows that, controlling for opportunity discovery and several other factors, external knowledge sources are positively associated with opportunity exploitation and the strength of this association is influenced by the organizational design of the firm.",opportunity exploitation| organizational design| knowledge-based view

We suggest a triplet of more precisely defined construct to capture what prior research has studied under the label of entrepreneurial opportunity. These three constructs are: Opportunity Conditions for the objective and usually actor-independent circumstances that make venture creation efforts more or less feasible; Perception of Opportunity for the individual-level assessment of such conditions (as well as their attractiveness in relation to the perceivers characteristics and situation), and Venture Ideas for the evolving set of conjectures that guide action in relation to perceived opportunities.",opportunity| venture idea| construct clarity

Grounded in theories of achievement goals, and motivated action, this paper moves a step further, suggesting that entrepreneurs may simultaneously hold multiple achievement subgoals for a principle goal.  For example, entrepreneurial subgoals can hold the characteristics of approach and avoidance motivations, as well as mastery and performance motivations, that all form part of one overarching goal.  Secondly, this paper suggests that the interplay between these achievement subgoals may serve an adaptive function.  To investigate these propositions, the principle goals of eighty early-stage entrepreneurs were investigated qualitatively, and the subgoals were classified as mastery approach, performance approach or performance avoidance.  The results demonstrated that entrepreneurs identified a range of subgoals which represented: one single achievement goal, combinations of two out of the three, and combinations of all three achievement goals.  Further qualitative analyses suggested that holding multiple combinations of achievement subgoals served an adaptive self-regulatory function, providing the entrepreneur with detailed cognitive primes or frames that could be used as feedback to indicate goal progress.  This research presents a novel angle that advances research on entrepreneurial motivation and achievement goals.  It demonstrates that even at the state level, entrepreneurs can hold multiple achievement subgoals for the same goal, and that this may serve an adaptive self-regulatory function for the entrepreneur in the advancement of the main vision for their venture.",entrepreneurial motivation| achievement goals| goal orientations

We investigate this question using novel data on the ethnic origins of 22,000 U.S.-based Venture Capitalists (VCs) and 98,000 top-level executives of the startup companies they invested in from 1991 to 2010. We find that VCs are more likely to invest in companies with executives that are ethnically similar to themselves. Evidence for homophily is strongest during early rounds of investment, when information costs of the relationship are high, and for ethnicities associated with collectivist cultures, such as Japanese, Korean and Chinese. Ethnic homophily between VCs and their portfolio companies is positively related to several measures of the companies performance, including: (i) survival to subsequent rounds of funding; (ii) probability of issuing an Initial Public Offering (IPO); and (iii) net income after the IPO. We estimate that a company with one additional executive who shares the ethnicity of a VCs partners is associated with a near doubling of the expected IRR for the VC from the investment. Ethnic homophily between VCs and startups has profound economic benefits, brought about through a reduction of the information costs of the relationship.Paper is No Longer Available Online: Please contact the author(s).",

We draw on prior research on entrepreneurial narratives to characterize Twitter as a medium conducive to conveying narrative fragments that collectively comprise a collage of symbolic messages. We use a qualitative study of eight entrepreneurial firms using Twitter to investigate the specific content of these narratives and to develop theoretical insights regarding narrative approaches on Twitter that are more versus less effective in cultivating higher levels and more types of online stakeholder engagement.   We find that firms that can balance persona, quality, and relational orientation narratives in their tweets, and that convey positive affect more often, garner more engaged responses from online stakeholders.

Employing probit regression on a sample of 603 entrepreneurial biotech firms, we find that upstream alliance experience exhibits a negative association with the likelihood of being acquired. In contrast, downstream alliance experience depicts a positive relationship with the likelihood of acquisition but only up to a point, beyond which the relationship turns negative, thus confirming a curvilinear effect.

Such influence is not straightforward, but occurs through different sorting processes by individuals into organizations and into entrepreneurship. These sorting processes ultimately make the determinants of initial size vulnerable to selection biases. Theoretical arguments are proposed to suggest why types of entrants lead to different initial size predictions, as well as the implications of sorting processes. We demonstrate that prior research may misreport the true effects of the entrepreneurs characteristics on initial size if types of entrants are treated as an all in one category.

At the individual-level, we suggest that social entrepreneurship ""widens the funnel"" of entrepreneurial entry by attracting different individuals to become social entrepreneurs, thereby giving them the confidence, experience and resources to create commercial firms. Applying multi-level modeling to population-representative samples in 47 countries, we find support for our hypotheses. We find that the entrepreneurial process, independent of its goals, is facilitated by strong institutional environments with a strong rule of law, property rights and constraints on the executive. We argue that this is not necessarily inconsistent with the institutional void perspective. We also find support for the spillover hypothesis.

According to motivated information processing theory, prosocial motivation may be a catalyst for voice in unfavorable contexts, as prosocially motivated employees are willing to accept the personal costs of speaking up in light of the group benefits. However, trait activation theory suggests the opposite: prosocially motivated employees may be particularly sensitive to context favorability as a relevant situational cue that their ideas will be considered and utilized. We test these competing hypotheses about the moderating role of prosocial motivation across two field studies using different measures to assess employees perceptions of context favorability and prosocial motivation, as well as supervisors ratings of voice. In Study 1, with employees at a military base, prosocial motivation attenuated the positive relationship between supervisor trustworthiness and voice.

This paper seeks to address this gap by presenting core entrepreneurship constructs in an institutional context. Specifically, we define opportunity, innovation and risk in an institutional setting. We also examine the dynamics underlying institutional opportunity, how institutional entrepreneurs exploit these opportunities through introducing innovation, and how different kinds of risk can moderate the relationship between opportunity and exploitation.",institutional opportunity| institutional risk| institutional entrepreneurship

To date, research has yet to consider the possibility that the effects of emotional labor spill over to life outside of work. However, a large literature examining the spillover from work life to home life indicates that work experiences influence employees even after they leave the workplace (c.f. Eby, Maher, & Butts, 2010). Drawing from the work family conflict literature, we examine the influence of daily surface acting on emotional exhaustion and strain-based work to family conflict experienced that evening, as well as insomnia experienced that night. In an experience sampling field study of 78 bus drivers, we found that daily surface acting had the predicted effects on each of the non-work based outcomes noted above.

Further, drawing on Ego Depletion Theory (Muraven & Baumeister, 2000), we develop a model in which daily surface acting is negatively associated with daily OCBIs. We test this model in two experience sampling methodology studies. In Study 1, we test the basic relation between daily surface acting and OCBIs. In Study 2, we expand our model by examining resource recovery (sleep) and resource depletion (emotional exhaustion) as important moderating factors.

First, we take the dominant understanding of myth as false explanation as a starting point to highlight available studies which undertake myth-busting and thus try to demystify the self-evidences of social entrepreneurship through scientific evidence. Pinpointing the limits of such rational critiques of myth, we, secondly, develop an ideological view of myth which conceives of social entrepreneurship as a necessary illusion that shapes the non-profit reality according to a certain image of innovativeness and efficiency. Harking back on Barthes (1972) telling statement that the best way to critique myth is to mythify it in return, we use this inspiration to develop a different form of demystification which works through socially embedded practices, notably language. This demystification from below is illustrated through a discourse analysis of non-profit practitioners. The study provides a case in point of how mundane speech simultaneously reproduces and transcends myth. Demonstrating how such interpretive work opens up spaces for novel articulations of the social, we conclude that prospective research on the myth-making of social entrepreneurship must endorse language-based inquiries as a means for enabling meanings which are systematically excluded from spectacular representations of social entrepreneurship.",discourse analysis| social entrepreneurship| myth

We close this gap by investigating the role that the different dimensions of job embeddedness (links, fit, sacrifice) can play in promoting ties with organizations and communities which impact on intentions of leaving.  We also examine the role that employee well-being (career satisfaction and life satisfaction) plays in mediating this relationship. Hypotheses are tested using data from 296 professional staff in Malaysia. As predicted, a good match between individuals and their organizations and communities increased levels of well-being. However, people became embedded by the perceived sacrifice to be made in leaving the organization.  Inversely, employees embedded in the community recognized the sacrifice they would make by leaving and chose to leave the organization rather than the community.

Structural equation modeling was used to test six hypotheses, using data collected from 416 full-time Taiwanese workers. Positive affectivity was found to be a relatively efficient predictor of WFE and FWE. The direct effects did not change when two mediators were added to the model. In addition, both supervisor support and family support mediated relationships between positive affectivity and FWE; compared to supervisor support, family support had a stronger correlation with FWE. Contrary to our prediction, supervisor support mediated the relationship between positive affectivity and WFE, but family support did not.

An investigation of employee volunteering",1|Jessica Rodell|U. of Georgia||,,"Volunteering is prevalent and on the rise in the United States, but little research has examined the connection between individuals volunteering and their jobs. In the absence of that research, it remains unclear whether employees volunteer to build on positive work experiences or in response to mundane ones. Similarly, it remains unclear whether volunteering is beneficial to the job in some way or if it is harmful because it creates conflict for employees. The current study integrates theorizing on multiple domains and social identity in order to build and test a model of the antecedents and consequences of volunteering. Results suggested that employees were drawn to meaningful volunteer work, and that this draw was stronger when employees lacked meaning in their jobs. The results further revealed benefits of volunteering for employers. Volunteering was related to identification with ones employer, which was associated with job performance (higher task performance and citizenship behavior, and lower counterproductive behavior). Volunteering was not, however, related to a sense of volunteering-job conflict.

We do not suggest that organizations eliminate the experience of negative affect following performance failuresainstead, we propose that they encourage a more constructive form of negative affect (guilt) instead of a destructive one (shame). We argue that guilt responses prompt employees to take corrective action following past mistakes, while shame responses are likely to elicit more detrimental effects of negative affect.  Highlighting the distinction between the adaptive nature of guilt and the less adaptive nature of shame within social settings, we assert that this same distinction is important within the workplace.  Further, we suggest that organizations can play a role in influencing employeesa discrete emotional reactions to the benefit of both employees and the organization. We describe three necessary antecedents for encouraging guilt responses without simultaneously eliciting shame in the workplace.  Essentially, employees are more likely to experience guilt (but not shame) if they feel as if they had control over a specific negative event and the event resulted in a negative outcome for others. Given these necessary preconditions, we identify a set of organizational characteristicsaautonomy, specificity of performance feedback, and outcome interdependenceathat can be modified to make the experience of guilt more likely than that of shame in the workplace.

We offer a complementary perspective emphasizing interpersonal dynamics to explain deviations from prescriptive and descriptive norms linked to common reference groups (society, occupation, organization, workgroup) and how their reactions affect organizational functioning.  We suggest a broader term, dysfunctional work behaviors, to reflect chronic non-normative behavior that occurs in interaction between two or more members and which elicits reactions that undermine an organizations ability to achieve desired outcomes.  Drawing from research on norms and deviance regulation theory (Blanton & Christie, 2003), we propose automatic and controlled information processing mechanisms to predict conditions under which individuals may engage in chronic non-normative behaviors. We then consider how others labeling processes trigger sensemaking about and ostracism of chronic deviates, thereby increasing mistrust, conflict, and communication difficulty and ultimately reducing workgroup efficiency and effectiveness.

Self-Determination Theory has indicated that the degree to which people are proactive and autonomously motivated is largely a result of the socio-psychological conditions in which they grow and function. The theory, however, has paid limited attention to underlying psychological processes and mechanisms through which people become more (or less) autonomously motivated. Knowledge about these processes might be useful in attempting to understand the development of stable orientations toward initiation and regulation of behaviors (i.e., general causality orientations). Furthermore, such knowledge may be used as a guiding tool for promoting autonomous motivation and for extenuating controlled behaviors at the workplace. We draw on attachment theory and on recent developments in adult attachment research as we attempt to describe the attachment-related mechanisms that underlie the development of general causality orientations and to suggest ways by which this knowledge can be applied to support autonomous motivation in the work context. Specifically, we discuss two major psychological mechanisms that can shape the development of general causality orientations and context-specific autonomous motivation, which we refer to as a secure home base and a secure workplace base respectively.

Building on 10 cases of entrepreneurial team formation, the rare existing research, similarity-attraction theory, resource dependence theory, and the concept of consideration set, I abductively develop an iterative multi-lens model of entrepreneurial team formation closer to reality and avoiding specialization.

Accordingly, the incumbent firm may not capture the value created by such human resource practices; rather the value may be transferred to a competing new venture started by an ex-employee.  Using theoretical rationale from the jack-of-all-trades theory of entrepreneurship (Lazear, 2004; 2005), social cognitive theory (Bandura, 1986), and equity theory (Adams, 1963; 1965), I argue that high performance human resource practices which (1) reduce perceived organizational complexity and (2) signal the value that an employee creates for the firm and the value that the organization creates as a whole, will be positively related to employee entrepreneurial activity. The proposed effects are expected to be stronger for individuals who are high in cognitive ability and weaker in industries that are capital-intensive. Implications for scholarship and practice are discussed.",spin-out| employee entrepreneurship| human resource management

Based on the premise that a young firms TMT mostly plays the role of stewards making agency issues less relevant, we propose that TMT characteristics and TMT ownership influence the use of external CV, particularly because external CV decisions are inherently fraught with uncertainties associated with exploration. We test our hypotheses using a sample of 164 young firms from high-technology industries and present a more complete picture drawing on reasoned risk-taking and upper echelon perspectives. Our results show that a negative curvilinear relationship exists between a combination of TMT diversity and non-duality and the number of corporate venture deals. Further, we also find that higher levels of TMT ownership allow young firms to more fully capture the benefits resulting from TMT heterogeneity through the use of external CV but only up to a threshold. Our findings contribute to the literatures in entrepreneurship, strategy and corporate governance.",corporate venturing| governance| heterogeneity

Matched data from 147 employees, their coworkers, and their supervisors was used to test the mediating role of perceived coworker support on the relationship between coworker knowledge sharing (rated by the coworker) and employee task performance (rated by the supervisor) as well as the moderating effects of employee!-s own exchange ideology. The result indicated that exchange ideology did not exert significant impact on the relationship between coworker knowledge sharing and perceived coworker support, but strong exchange ideology weakened the positive relationship between perceived coworker support and employee task performance. Our findings reveal another aspect of social exchange involving the coworker, heretofore uncovered by previous studies, on how individuals with strong exchange ideology pursue their self-interests.",exchange ideology| task performance| employee-coworker relationship

This paper proposes a model of collaboration including affective, cognitive and organizational antecedents, and measures its effects on individual and team performance in the knowledge-based industry. Over 900 front line employees in two firms in the service industry were surveyed. Structural Equation Modeling and bootstrap analysis were used to examine its role as a mediator between three independent variables (i.e. commitment, self-efficacy, and collaborative-based reward system) and three dependent variables (i.e. individual success, team efficiency and quality service) while controlling for management support. As anticipated, collaboration partially mediates the effects of affective commitment and self-efficacy on individual success, and partially mediates the effect of collaborative-based reward system on team efficiency and quality. Staffing practices and designing a collaborative-based reward system to enhance employee success and team performance are discussed.

One thousand one hundred and eighty-five daily surveys were collected from 149 Chinese customer service representatives from a call center for 8 weekdays. Results from multilevel analyses largely supported the role of emotional exhaustion in mediating the lagged association between customer mistreatment and employees negative mood in the next morning. Positive treatment by customers buffered the detrimental effect of demanding mistreatment. In addition, the current findings supported the moderating roles of rumination and social sharing in strengthening the impacts of customer mistreatment, but were not consistent across aggressive mistreatment and demanding mistreatment.

Negative display rules, emotional labor strategy and work outcomes",1|David Chee-mun Cheng|U. of New South Wales||2|Lu Wang|U. of New South Wales||,,"Increasing research has shown that many organizations require their employees to produce positive emotional displays as part of their job, and such display rules have both positive and negative consequences (Hulsheger & Schewe, 2011). Although organizations also require employees to display negative emotions for the purposes of carrying out work duties, less attention has focused on the impact of these negative emotional display rules. Based on a survey of five large credit card debt collection agencies, this study shows that perceived negative emotional display rules significantly influences employees performance, emotional exhaustion, and workplace deviance. More importantly, the differential effects of perceived negative display rules are mediated by the emotional regulation strategies employees use. Deep acting results in increased employee performance while surface acting leads to emotional exhaustion and workplace deviance.

Using multilevel modeling, we found divergent effects of display rules that require suppressing negative emotions versus those that require expressing positive emotions on employees affective commitment and intention to leave. We also found that unit-level display rules explain variance over and above individual-level display rules and that unit- and individual-level display rules interact to amplify work outcomes for individuals. Together these results suggest that display rules exist as both shared beliefs and individual perceptions. In addition, not all display rules are created equal.

Nixon|Willamette U.||,,"This project tested a theoretical model proposed by Herschovis, in which nuances of workplace aggression experiences, including the intensity of the experience, the intention attributions made by the target, the relationship power between the perpetrator and the target, and the perceived visibility of the aggression, operate as moderators of workplace aggression-strain relationships, was examined. Data from 444 employed nurses were used to examine main and moderation effects. Results indicated that the workplace aggression scale and measures of intensity, intention attribution, relationship power, and perceived visibility were all positively related to depression, anxiety, physical symptoms, musculoskeletal injuries, and turnover intentions. Furthermore, workplace aggression, intention attributions, and relationship power were positively related to contagious disease exposure for nurses. Although limited evidence was found for moderation effects, intensity seemed to exacerbate the relationships between workplace aggression with depression and musculoskeletal injuries. Likewise, perceived visibility seemed to exacerbate the relationship between workplace aggression and depression. Overall, this study uniquely examines the underlying nuances of workplace aggression and represents a step toward theoretically unifying research in the workplace aggression domain.",workplace aggression| employee well-being| nurse safety

Combining predictions from moral exclusion and interdependence theory, we hypothesize that supervisors perceptions of subordinate performance will negatively associate with abusive supervision only if supervisors outcomes depend on such performance. Further, we propose that abusive supervision will inversely relate with subordinates subsequent, actual work performance. Finally, we build on the self-fulfilling prophecy literature to integrate these hypotheses. Under conditions of high (but not low) outcome dependence, abusive supervision is suggested to represent a crucial mediator that links subordinates perceived and actual work performance. We empirically test these hypotheses across two independent studies, using both an experimental scenario design (N = 157; Study 1) and a field research design (N = 183; Study 2). Results supported our predictions across both studies. All in all, these findings promote new knowledge on the origins of abusive supervision and advance a more comprehensive view of the abusive supervision  subordinate performance linkage, illustrating such hostile supervisor behavior as a possible mediating mechanism for self-fulfilling prophecy effects in organizations.",abusive supervision| subordinate performance| outcome dependence

Jensen|George Washington U.||,,"Based on the victim precipitation model, we extend research on the relationship between job performance and victimization at the individual and group level. We invoke social comparison theory to explain why individual low and high performers are more likely to be victimized than average performers and apply attribution theory to explain why greater performance polarization within groups relates to greater within-group victimization. We argue these effects are mitigated by equity sensitivity such that benevolent high and low performers are less likely to be victimized than their entitled counterparts and that groups comprised of more benevolent members experience lower within-group victimization. Results from data collected at three different time points from 576 individuals in 62 workgroups support the proposed framework.  The findings suggest that performance is not merely an endpoint, but also a precipitating factor to negative treatment in the workplace, with implications for individual and group effectiveness.",performance| aggression| victimization

Krasikova|U. of Nebraska, Lincoln||",,"This study is the first attempt to empirically examine destructive leadership as a multifaceted phenomenon by simultaneously considering its two manifestations - leaders pursuit of destructive goals and use of destructive leadership style with followers. The study demonstrates that leaders are more likely to pursue destructive goals that contradict organizations legitimate interests when their goals are misaligned with organizational goals, and more likely to use harmful methods of influence (i.e., use destructive leadership style) when their goals are thwarted by followers. Further, the findings suggest that leaders implicit aggression motive makes leaders more prone to experience situations of goal blockage and thus more likely to engage in destructive leadership. Also, when situations of goal blockage occur, aggressive leaders are more likely to pursue destructive goals and use destructive leadership style than non-aggressive leaders. Finally, the results indicate that followers may use more assertive responses to leaders destructive leadership style than leaders destructive goal pursuit, although, overall, less assertive responses to both manifestations of destructive leadership are used more frequently.",destructive leadership| goal blockage| aggression

In addition, this study found that the supervisors and a chosen coworkers trust of the employee were associated (negatively) with the employees turnover intentions.  We detected a supervisor trust X coworker trust interaction, suggesting that a chosen coworkers trust plays a more important role in forming the employees turnover intentions when supervisory trust is relatively low.  This study also looked at the moderating effect of culture.  Surveys were completed by 86 Russians, 113 Poles, 156 Americans, and 210 Turks.

More recent research (Huselid & Day, 1991), however, discounts such findings, concluding that when the more appropriate quantitative methods are employed there is no interaction. Our study revisits this debate to not only bring a ray of clarity to ambiguous findings in the field of turnover, but to also re-acknowledge the importance of theory and methodology in our journey to understanding phenomenon as organizational scientists. Results provide evidence for the job involvement-organizational commitment interaction on a sample of 347 employees from a national insurance firm. The nature of the interaction in our study, however, differs from Blau and Boals (1989). We find that organizational commitment is a less powerful predictor of turnover for those who have high job involvement. Interestingly, in our sample individuals with high job involvement have elevated levels of turnover when compared to those with low levels of job involvement.

Our data involving 192 in-person surveys and 52 depth interviews of microentrepreneurs in Guatemala City suggest that while formal business registration can be associated with greater access to financial and human capital, in the absence of strong legal enforcement mechanisms, business formality also leads to significantly higher levels of theft, vandalism, and extortion. Specifically, the need for formal businesses to publicly demonstrate adherence to the rules and norms of regulatory institutions simultaneously produces unintended signals to criminals who see formal entrepreneurs as more attractive targets. Thus our study suggests that giving greater consideration to institutional polycentricity within discussions involving the costs and benefits of entrepreneur (in) formality as a path towards poverty alleviation can have significant practical and theoretical implications.",formality| institutions| poverty

Building on this notion, we introduce the concept of fear of negative evaluation to the proactivity literature. We develop and test theory that explains how the adverse effect of fear of negative evaluation on proactive behavior may be mitigated by internal (regulatory focus) and external (work design) sources of self-regulation. In particular, we theorize that high levels of regulatory focus may mitigate the negative effect of fear of negative evaluation and that a lack of regulatory focus may be compensated for by work design features. Our empirical results (N = 845) support the buffering effect of regulatory focus and the compensating role of social work design features. However, contrary to our prediction, task characteristics of work design constitute a precondition rather than a compensation for regulatory focus.

A first process model, which explains the emergence or absence of end-user IS security behavior, is the technology threat avoidance theory (TTAT). The present study extends the TTAT by formalizing and testing a mathematical model that allowed for simulating the evolution of individual IS security behavior over time. Our model supplemented the TTAT with elements from unidirectional, and control-theoretical approaches on risk perception and coping behavior. The ability of our model to reproduce behavior similar to that assumed by theory-driven propositions was tested and its behavior space was explored by manipulating exogenous factors. As expected, the simulations revealed that the tolerated threat threshold determined the resulting level of individual IS security behavior. Surprisingly, providing more information about risks turned out to be counter-productive in the case of low perceived coping efficacy. Furthermore, efforts to enhance perceived coping efficacy were only successful in increasing individual IS security behavior when combined with increases in the perceived overall threat and decreases in the tolerated threat threshold. In conclusion, we discuss the limitations of the model as well as implications for further research and practice.",process theory| risk| simulation

We represent how leadership is informally distributed among group members as a network, in which nodes and ties represent group members and leadership perceptions respectively. After tracking such network at sequential points in time, we model its evolution using stochastic-actor-oriented models, specifically designed for analyzing longitudinal network data. We found that not all dimensions of narcissism facilitate leadership emergence. Exhibitionism clearly impedes ones chance to emerge as a leader.

The study further shows that the negative effect of competition on knowledge sharing is attenuated by a teams upward lobbying efforts  seeking management support to induce other teams to share knowledge  but that the effects of upward lobbying and organizational identity on knowledge sharing interact negatively. The effects of the model are generally stronger when knowledge sharing involves know-how (knowledge about how things are done) rather than know-what (information and facts).

Traditional studies have focused on homophily to explain how knowledge diffuses.  Recent work, however, suggests that heterogeneous interactions inject unique information, they encourage exchanges by introducing interesting topics to discuss, and they create conflicting constraints thus pressuring agents to adapt to one anothers preferences.

Frequent interaction appears to make little difference for high diversity groups, but is critical for homogeneous groups.

We build a moderated mediation model and, using data collected from 709 athletes in 74 semi-professional basketball teams, confirm the importance of both the absolute and relative levels of trust within teams. We also emphasize the role of two distinct sources of trust: trust in fellow team members and trust in the leader; and contrast the predictive power of the two dimensions of trust: cognitive and affective trust. Contrary to our hypothesis, consensus in trust in teammates does not lead to better team performance, while consensus in trust in the coach through trust in teammates predicts future team performance. Our findings suggest that coaches need to ensure that as best possible every team member trust them.

We build theory to examine how relational climates provide a context for the development of team trust from individual beliefs of team members. In particular, we focus on how different relational climates can either buffer or enhance the negative effect of individual social cynicism on team trust. Cross-level interactions of relational climates (i.e., communal sharing climate and equality matching climate) at the team level (N = 270) with social cynicism at the individual level (N = 1886) support our hypotheses, indicating that communal sharing climate buffers the negative effect of social cynicism on team trust, whereas equality matching climate enhances this adverse effect.",relational climates| trust| social cynicism

In a field study of 73 work groups from Dutch and German organizations, we demonstrated that task simplicity is an important moderator of this group-level relationship. It was found that when groups carry out simple tasks, steeper status hierarchies enhance group performance by reducing the amount of conflict within these groups. Hierarchy steepness did not yield such clear performance or conflict effects in work groups that executed complex tasks. Our findings contribute to status research by demonstrating the task conditions under which steeper status hierarchies benefit group functioning and by showing a mechanism that is driving this effect. The implications of our results are discussed in light of status theories and related to organizational practices.",status hierarchy steepness| task simplicity| group performance

Error management culture further had indirect effects on key individual outcomes such as leadership behavior/performance as well as indices of ascendancy and career success (i.e. increased leadership responsibility and promotions).  We also found that motivation to develop leadership capability was a better predictor of leadership behavior and other success outcomes than motivation to lead.

First, since low TMT cohesion presents a non-social and uninspiring leadership role model, such behavior may reduce the transformational leadership of managers. Second, when employees become disappointed and frustrated by low TMT cohesion, a negative and corrosive atmosphere may arise across the organization through contagion. Analyses of a dataset of 19.212 respondents from 101 organizations support these expectations. The results also show that managers can reduce the detrimental effects of a corrosive atmosphere on employee turnover intentions through transformational leadership. By demonstrating the above this study provides  new insights into the wide-ranging, and potentially detrimental, impact which TMTs can have on their organization.",top management team cohesion| turnover intentions among employees| transformational leadership

We suggest that a selling orientation interferes with interviewers abilities to accurately judge applicants and predict their future behavior.  Results from two field studies confirm that increased selling focus reduces the extent to which interviewers judgments predict applicants subsequent behaviors.  Specifically, when selling orientation is low, interviewers ratings of applicants core self-evaluations significantly predict applicants future citizenship behaviors, value congruence, and success.  When selling orientation is high, interviewers judgments no longer predict applicant outcomes.

In addition, the influence of the interplay between goal orientation profiles and the perceived motivational climate (i.e., a performance- and mastery climate) in predicting work performance is non-existent. Based on a sample of 1081 engineers and technologists, our results suggest that four different goal orientation profiles exist. The high mastery/high performance goal orientation profile represents the high achievers within the workforce in terms of work performance. The results also indicate that a mastery climate is more beneficial than a performance climate in predicting higher work performance.

We examined antecedents and outcomes of individuals psychological perceptions of climate for diversity in an effort to expand the nomological network. The extent to which individuals are exposed to diversity and the extent to which they receive information regarding diversity from the organization from various types of media sources were purported to relate to their perceptions of climate for diversity which, in turn, were proposed to be related to their racial understanding, sense of belonging, ethnic identity, and performance. Further, individuals race was purported to moderate these. Hypotheses were tested in two university samples of 871 newcomers and 688 incumbents, which allowed for replicating the study. Overall, the results supported the proposed model.

Is it inevitable that targets experience these negative consequences, tainting what might otherwise have been a positive workplace environment? We propose that, despite its negative connotations, the act of confronting an expression of prejudice may actually benefit targets otherwise negative impressions following an experience with explicit bias in the workplace. We hypothesize, however, that this will be the case only among targets of prejudice who believe others can change (i.e., who hold an incremental theory), as opposed to those who believe that others cannot change (i.e., who hold an entity theory). Across three studies, we examined entity and incremental theorists expectations of what would follow from confronting an expression of bias vs. not. Study 1 elicited a national sample of African American adults retrospective accounts of bias in the workplace while Studies 2-3 used a hypothetical workplace scenario to expose participants to evidence of someone who had expressed bias either remaining the same or changing over time. Across these studies, even when entity and incremental theorists enacted the same (actual or anticipated) confronting behavior, only incremental theorists viewed this behavior as yielding more positive consequences. These results suggest that implicit theories play a central role in targets perceptions of the consequences of confronting and present the novel implication that the confronting of prejudice may actually serve to help repair workplace relations between targets and the communicator of bias.",workplace diversity| prejudice| intergroup interactions

This distortion of the past involved overestimating the number of Black individuals they had encountered on the prior task (Study 1), and exaggerating how stereotypically Black specific individuals had looked (Studies 2 and 3).  Follow-up studies found that when White participants could point to racist alternatives to their past actions, they felt they had obtained more evidence of their morality (Study 4), they expressed less racial sensitivity (Study 5), and they were more likely express preferences about employment and allocating money that favored Whites at the expense of Blacks (Study 6).

Taking a longitudinal approach, 253 newcomers from various organizations participated in two surveys separated by a 12-week interval. The results showed that newcomers utilized !(r)belief-driven!- sensemaking as well as !(r)action-driven!- sensemaking for promise making. The more organizational messages newcomers perceived, the more promises they perceived. Additionally, perceived inducements/contributions were positively related to perceived promises. In particular, from a belief-driven sensemaking standpoint, institutionalized socialization tactics and relational leader behaviors were found to show a positive relationship with perceived organizational messages, while showing indirect effects on perceived promises. Also, a significant interaction between the two processes was found, such that when the organizational messages and the actual experiences of inducements/contributions were well matched, the influence of the organizational messages on perceived promises was much stronger. The main contribution of this study is that it proposes a new theoretical model about a newcomers!- formation process of the psychological contract and empirically tests it.

In addition, the leader's group-focused transformational leadership has a positive indirect effect on leader performance via group's overall justice climate. Importantly, justice climate helps to connect group-focused leadership to DITL such that justice climate moderates the inverted U-shaped relationship between DITL and leader performance.

Behavioral decision theory and neuroscience provide compelling arguments to examine its decision-making antecedents, by centralizing the integration of affective and cognitive processes in ecologically adaptive and evolutionarily successful decision-making that may be key to transformational leadership. This research effort combines multiple theoretical lenses to offer an alternative, neuropsychological profile of effective transformational leadership in the context of decision-making, by proposing prefrontal brain processes as a key individual differences component. One hundred and five corporate leaders were assessed on classic, scientific and clinically valid neuropsychological indices of decision-making and executive control (attention monitoring and cognitive control) that discretely measure the function of the main neural systems in the prefrontal cortex. The interaction of decision-making with executive control mechanisms, incrementally predicted transformational leadership above and beyond the extant antecedents of extraversion and general mental ability. This broadens our knowledge base  by empirically indicating that transformational leadership is predicted by stable decision-making and competence in flexible thinking: in inferring rules, managing goal hierarchies and shifting temporal (now/later) and conceptual(abstract/concrete) contingencies. These neuropsychological results also indicate a biological substrate (in the role of distinct, independent, yet interacting neural subsystems in the pre-frontal cortex) that may underlie these antecedents. To conclude, neuroscience has the potential to specify the neural subsystems that underlie leadership effectiveness; and to provide robust, enhanced measurement of this effectiveness, in comparison to the more global constructs of personality and GMA available in the literature thus far. This cross-disciplinary initiative thus has the potential to offer biomarkers and metrics of leadership that further not only our foundational knowledge of organizational behavior, but also be applied in management practice.",decision-making| leadership| neuroscience

We remedy such theoretical underdevelopment by reviewing and integrating theory on the relationships between demands, control and support to develop 5 main effect hypotheses and 3 moderator research questions.  We test our hypotheses within a meta-analytic framework using a set of 106 studies.

Our findings also indicate a positive control-supervisor support relationship, but no control-coworker support relationship.  Moreover, the proportion of female participants moderated 3 effect sizessuggesting the importance of gender segregation on work characteristics.  Finally, average organizational tenure moderated 2 effect sizes, suggesting that firm specific human capital and coworker networks are important for job perceptions.

We adopt a new statistical procedure in combination with bootstrapping to allow for analytical assessment of the nonlinear indirect associations. The results provide support for the hypotheses, as the effect sizes of the indirect relationships decrease when the proportion of breached obligations increases.

In the beginning of the relationships direct reciprocation is wanted while trust is still low. However, as one have positive experience with goodwill actions being reciprocated more diffuse forms of reciprocation can develop as trust grows. As such, some forms of reciprocity are more dependent on trust than others. Closer to termination specific reciprocity is again warranted as there is limited time to get any rewards back.

Our findings suggest that narcissism (self-orientation) and relativism are negatively associated with follower perceptions of ethical leadership. In addition, as an outcome, prior research has largely focused on follower performance or behaviors through leader-based assessments. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of leaders themselves based on reports from peers or superiors. We find that ethical leadership is positively associated with leader effectiveness.",ethical leadership| narcissism| ethical ideology

In Study 1, data from 704 employees and 169 leaders showed leader humility synergistically interacts with leader competence to predict team experimentation and team performance. In Study 2, data from 907 employees and 137 leaders showed that the paradoxical coupling of leader humility and leader narcissism strongly predicts employee engagement and employee objective performance, while the main effects did not.

While personnel selection favors conscientious individuals, for creativity, this selection criterion is often detrimental. By integrating research on group diversity, elderly stereotypes and personality research, this study investigates and finds a moderating effect of elderly stereotypes on the relationship of conscientiousness and different creativity dimensions. In an experimental setting with 55 four-person groups consisting of two younger and two older adults, we manipulated elderly stereotypes and found that the creative fluency of highly conscientious age-diverse teams was higher when elderly stereotypes were positive, and respectively lower for the control group and the negative age-stereotype condition. For depth, a creativity dimension relying on perseverance, the effects were diametrically reversed.

I describe implicit personality and its and relationship to existing personality concepts, and then provide a test of theory using an implicit measure of achievement motivation. I theoretically link achievement motivation to individual creative performance and describe how this relationship is moderated by expectations of different types of evaluations. This theory is then tested in a laboratory study with a measure of implicit achievement motivation. Results suggest achievement motivation, measured implicitly, is related to creative performance and is moderated by expectation of evaluation. This effect holds when controlling for other factors previously tested as predictors of creativity and an explicit measure of achievement motivation. Previous studies testing the link between achievement motivation and creativity had found no effect when using explicit measures. The major implications of this study are that achievement motivation is an important predictor of creative performance and that management researchers should give more credence to the utility of implicit personality.",implicit personality| achievement motivation| creativity

This research addressed this question in the reputation networks of a group of aspiring fashion designers, examining the social network influences on both the style of producers work and on experts (gatekeepers) endorsements. In the friendship network, it was found that the need for distinction was a source of stylistic innovation, as producers attempted to differentiate their styles from that of their social rivals. Furthermore, to the extent that producers were seen to replicate the styles of their friendship groups, gatekeepers assessment of their performance was favorable. The opposite pattern emerged in the admiration network. Designers who occupied similar roles were more likely to replicate each others stylistic innovations, leading to convergence on a particular style. Designers who were less embedded in the clique network tended to fare better to the extent that they adhered to prevailing stylistic norms, whereas producers who had earned the endorsement of their peers were free to experiment stylistically with little effect on their performance.

Although they can be significant for the well-being of both the careprovider and the carereceiver  and for the organizational atmosphere, these acts of caregiving have not received the research attention they would deserve. The aim of this article is to provide insight into the relational nature of these encounters through examining the everyday contacts between nurses and residents in a nursing home. Based on interviews and participant observation analyzed through grounded theory I argue that in caring situations both participants can choose to either be emotionally engaged or disengaged in the situation. This gives rise to four different types of caring situation: Instrumental caretaking, unmet call for caring, one-sided caregiving and caring connections. Focusing especially on the caring connections I argue that they are highly satisfactory for both participants and that in them the interpersonal dimension between the participants is flourishing. I see that they are composed of six elements: mutual validation, being present in the now-moment, opening up towards the other, establishing a shared space, heightened flow of affectivity, and acts of caregiving and displays of gratitude.",caregiving| compassion| relational

Participants included 430 employees and 132 supervisors from an international insurance company in Hong Kong. Employees were asked to report their perceived organizational and supervisor support, as well as the levels of self-concept. Employees' performance and organizational citizenship behaviors were rated by their supervisors. Four profiles including team abusers, team players, disconnected, and disappointed employees were identified in a multilevel latent profile analysis. Among the two groups with high perceived support, team players showed relatively weaker individual self-concept and better performance compared with team abusers. Among the two groups with low perceived support, disappointed employees showed relatively stronger relational and collective self-concepts and worse performance compared with disconnected employees. Findings supported the moderating role of self-concepts and suggested that levels of self-concepts may differentially interact with the psychological functions of POS. Strong relational and collective self-concepts may indicate employees' socioemotional needs, whereas individual self-concept may weaken one's felt obligations.

Accordingly, my task in this article is to look at leadership as a relational and complex phenomenon that emerges from the interdependencies and the socially constructed process between organizational members. Through this perspective I look at an nursing home as an empirical context to find out how the role for the leader in this type of organization is constructed through follower expectations. Through an analysis and categorization of the interviews, I identify seven different themes  supervising the work, taking responsibility, trusting the employees, being an authority, mediating the conflicts, giving emotional support, and being just  with one to three categories in each, that capture the main expectations that the followers have towards their supervisor in such an organization.

In this paper, we present an alternative view of the way individuals experience JI.  Drawing from two-process perceived control model (Rothbaum, Weisz, & Synder, 1982), we propose that employees experiencing JI will attempt to regain a sense of control by engaging in impression management tactics directed at powerful others, including ingratiation (i.e., appearing to be friendly), self-promotion (i.e., appearing to be competent) and exemplification (i.e., appearing to be dedicated).  Using a time-lagged design conducted in China, we found a positive relationship between JI and ingratiation, exemplification but not self-promotion.  In addition, we also found that sense of power moderated the relationship between JI and self-promotion and perceived supervisor power moderated the relationship between JI and ingratiation.",job insecurity| coping| perceived control

Using data collected from 273 employees and their peers at multiple points in time, we find that OCBs are more likely to be associated with citizenship fatigue when perceived organizational support is low. Further, OCBs are less likely to be associated with citizenship fatigue when team-member exchange is high and when citizenship pressure is low.

Challenge stressors were more positively associated with performance of Marines whose leaders were judged to have high charisma. These Marines appraised the stressors as being more challenging, and they were more likely to respond to this appraisal with higher performance.

Scholars have engaged in discussions around several tensions regarding aspects of human flourishing and virtuousness through the lens of POS. With regard to virtues and virtuousness, these tensions include the locus of residence (internal character vs external behavior), the level of degree (golden mean vs more is better), the level of analysis (individual virtuousness vs organizational virtuousness), and the matter of context (contextual vs universal). Virtuousness signifies a core concept within Positive Organizational Scholarship, and the legitimacy and credibility of POS is at least partly dependent on whether or not these tensions can be addressed from a grounded or theoretical perspective.

The present study investigated their combined effects and found that pride interacts with moral identity in predicting ethical leader behavior. Specifically, in two experiments we found that with higher levels of moral identity authentically proud leaders are more likely to engage in ethical behavior than hubristically proud leaders, and that this effect is mediated by leaders motivation to act selflessly. A field survey among organizational leaders corroborated that authentic (hubristic) pride is positively (negatively) related to ethical leadership.

Recent advances point to two possible key constructs, namely, collective-focused leadership climate and differentiated individual-focused leadership. These constructs are important as they can have opposite effects on collective outcomes. However, at present, no single overarching theoretical framework has been put forward to help understand these opposite effects. Therefore, this study develops and tests a new, more unified, perspective. Drawing from the commitment literature and in particular the often used theories of social exchange and perceived organizational support therein, we first argue for opposite effects on the affective organization commitment climate among employees. Then we reason that organizational performance can increase, if such affective commitment is put into action and raise the organizational-citizenship-behavior climate. Our three-path-mediation hypotheses are tested, and supported, by Structural Equation Modeling analyses in a multi-source dataset that contains more than 18,000 respondents from 175 companies.

While previous research has investigated the influence of different diversity factors on SMMs, the impact of language differences has surprisingly been neglected so far. To address this important gap we investigate how different elements of the language barrier impede the formation of different types of SMMs. Based on 84 semi-structured interviews with team leaders, members and senior managers of 15 multinational teams in three German automotive corporations we develop a model showing how pragmatic and paraverbal barriers between team members obstruct SMMs about roles, responsibilities and interaction patterns and how shortcomings in lexical, syntactical and phonetic proficiency impede SMMs about team members' preferences, strengths, weaknesses as well as values and attitudes. These findings integrate linguistic and psychological theories with management studies and complement our understanding of the antecedents of SMMs in multinational teams. This is of crucial importance since SMMs have been established as important prerequisites for team performance.",language| shared mental models| multinational teams

Rotterdam||,,"Organizational diversity research, largely carried out in the context of workgroups or teams, has attempted to categorize diversity into various types. We argue that these categories are over-simplistic, ambiguous, and force researchers to make difficult choices from a range of labels and blurred distinctions. Classifications often fail to explain how diversity in the same attribute can have polyvalent or simultaneous mixed effects on team outcomes. By reviewing previous classification schemes and team diversity descriptions, we develop a multi-dimensional framework for conceptualizing any potential team diversity in a way that better reflects its complexity and richness. Analogous to recent research on the description of team types, our framework is based on continuous dimensions, rather than categorical taxonomies. Based on existing literature, we propose four continua for describing team member differences: Task Relevance, Visibility, Malleability, and Inequality. We show that these dimensions integrate past distinctions into a single parsimonious framework, and discuss the implications for researching and managing diversity in work teams.",diversity| team| conceptualization

Our study seeks to extend the applicability of behavioral leadership theory to the broader examination of team dynamics in virtual teams.    We developed and use a content analysis framework deductively-derived from the literature on behavioral leadership to examine discourse, task-oriented, relationship-oriented, change, and network/boundary spanning communication behavior at two points in time in the ongoing interaction of the virtual team.   Our findings support the notion the derived behavioral framework can be appreciably used to study emerging team dynamics over the lifecycle of virtual team interaction.  Shifts in team dynamics not found in previous studies of virtual teams were found.  In particular, relationship-oriented behavior, which was not found to be common in prior studies, was the most prevalent form of communication with in the team at the two points in time at which interaction was examined.  Additional shifts were observed in the proportion of process and substance communication related to the teams task that were not found in earlier studies.Although preliminary, these findings suggest that team dynamics in long-standing technology-supported virtual teams differ from those found in virtual teams that focus on the completion of a single task within a relatively short-timeframe, which have been the focus of the majority of studies of virtual teams.

This paper shows that consensus-based dyadic agreement is highly associated with negative ties. This effect is augmented when a dyad bears high structural equivalence. Embeddedness in local transitive triads is likely to yield higher dyadic agreement, but only when negative ties are also present. Yet, when considering identity (local) dyadic agreement, post hoc findings show that positive dyadic relations are associated with agreement. Thus, while consensus-based agreement might generate unintended negative ties, local agreement seems to impose less strain on relationships.",intraorganizational network analysis| consensus| conflict

The present study explores the possibility that the structure of positive social relationships shapes the formation of negative relationships.  Drawing upon social resources, balance, and conflict theories, we argue that the structure of connections within each individuals set of positive relationships as well as the indirect positive connections between individuals may each influence the likelihood that a negative relationship will occur.  We further argue that shared team membership is likely to be an important moderator of these associations.  To test our hypotheses, we conducted a social network field study of 137 individuals in a community development organization.  Our study provides evidence that the structure of positive affective relationships is associated with likelihood of negative affective relationship formation.  More specifically, we find that having dense personal relationships makes one less likely to receive a negative tie nomination and that having third parties in common reduces the likelihood that two teammates will have a negative relationship.  The empirical results illustrate the value of considering the interplay of position in the positive tie and negative tie networks.",social networks| negative relationships| third parties

Specifically, we have simulated the complex interplays of variables (servant and transformational leadership, work characteristics, internal environment, and external environment) to examine their effects on group task satisfaction. We designed experimental scenarios involving varying the group profiles and task interdependence levels for each of the leadership styles. The group task satisfaction developmental paths arising from the influence of both servant and transformational leadership were compared and we observed that servant leadership influenced high profile groups with high task interdependence levels to attain higher satisfaction faster than transformational leadership.

With regard to team leadership, most studies have considered neither the specific characteristics of context that contribute to team effectiveness nor the leadership functions that may explain variability between teams. This study aims to compare leadership functions from two different team contexts using a qualitative approach. Seven leaders of multidisciplinary child and youth protection teams (MDT), and nine top managers of an information technology (IT) company took part in semi-structured interviews. The data were analyzed using content analysis with Atlas.ti software. The results showed that the two types of teams used very different criteria for their performance assessment. Specifically, teams from non-profit contexts lack defined performance criteria. With regard to leadership, transition team leadership functions are more frequently mentioned by IT top managers, than by MDT leaders. Action team leadership functions and interpersonal team leadership functions are mentioned more or less equally by team leaders from both contexts. Other categories emerged from the analysis, especially those mentioned by MDT leaders. This study shows that the emphasis on team leadership functions can vary according to contexts. Moreover, this study was the first to compare the model of Morgeson, DeRue & Karam (2010) in two different team contexts.

Structural equation results supported our hypotheses and showed that challenge appraisals were negatively predicted by employees dispositional resistance to change and positively predicted by change management effectiveness. Threat appraisals were predicted negatively and only by change management effectiveness. Our longitudinal results also revealed that both compliance and championing were positively predicted challenge appraisals, while championing was negatively predicted by threat appraisals.

Results show that learning goal orientation has significant positive relationships with both dimensions of intrinsic motivation, but only challenge intrinsic motivation is significantly related to creative performance and mediates the positive relationship between learning goal orientation and creative performance. As predicted, intellectual stimulation, a dimension of transformational leadership, shows a moderating effect, such that learning goal orientation is less positively related to challenge intrinsic motivation when intellectual stimulation is high. Consistent with this result, conditional indirect effect of learning goal orientation on creative performance through challenge intrinsic motivation is weaker when intellectual stimulation is high.

Drawing on social identity theory, I propose that identification with these social groups influences the novelty and usefulness of newly generated ideas.

Envy and unfairness may appear blended with each other because both of these constructs depict unpleasant states involving upward social comparison.

We adopt a deonance perspective (Folger, 2001) that theorizes a moral motive (as opposed to strictly instrumental or relational motives) behind such third-party reactions. Across three studies, we find consistent evidence that moral identity influences third parties reactions to injusticeaffecting emotions, cognitions, and even decisions. Specifically, white Americans with strong (compared to weak) moral identities report more negative emotions (study 1) and stronger justice-related cognitions (study 2) in response to the mistreatment of racial minorities. Furthermore, moral identity moderates the positive relationship between injustice-attenuating policy attitudes (i.e., promoting racial equality) and decisions to punish perpetrators of injustice. Taken together, these findings support the notion of a moral motive behind third parties reactions to injustice by demonstrating the influential role of moral identity.",third parties| justice| moral identity

An agent-based computational model (ABM) is employed to simulate the proposed model. Our simulation results indicate that members with loss experience have greater influence on choice shift than members with gain experience do. The direction of choice shift is mostly towards a more risky preference. Additionally, a three-way interaction between expertise distribution, team composition, and team cohesion is revealed. Specifically, team decisions are the most risky under a high cohesion/high expertise condition and the most cautious under a low expertise/low cohesion condition. Team choices shift least when both cohesion and expertise are low. High cohesion teams display more risky shift whereas low cohesion teams shows more cautious shift. Also, when team cohesion is low, the effect of expertise distribution is more salient, and specifically, heterogeneous-expertise teams display more choice shift than low and high expertise teams across all types of team composition.",risky decision making| expertise| choice shift

It is not clear, however, how the impact of membership change on performance is affected by the way interdependent work is organized. This paper investigates two ways that interdependence influences team adaptation to membership change: the departing members central position in a network of task activity and the degree to which a team organizes its work in a centralized way. I examine unexpected membership change from player injury, and its consequences, in professional hockey teams. Although the exits of central and peripheral members negatively affect team performance initially after an injury, the teams rate of recovery is faster when a central player leaves. Further, while team centralization has no influence on initial team performance, over time it dramatically alters team outcomes. When teams have a more centralized structure, their performance after a players exit improves over time regardless of the departing players network position. Decentralized teams generally perform more poorly over time, unless the exit is by a central player.

In recent years, scholars have responded to the increased use of adaptive teams by focusing specific attention to how to lead adaptive teams. Although scholars have long discussed the potential for non-traditional and emerging conceptualizations of leadership in teams, including adaptive teams, much of the work, to date, has conceptualized adaptive team leaders as single, hierarchically positioned individuals who exert top-down, and often external, influence on their teams. As such, we currently know little about alternative forms of leadership in adaptive teams. In this article, we challenge previous conceptualizations of adaptive team leadership by proposing and exploring shared team leadership arrangements in adaptive teams. Shared team leadership is an emergent compilation process of mutual influence on team inputs, processes, and/or outcomes by two or more interdependent individuals who are connected by team membership that is intended to help that team reach mutually shared team goals. Because shared team leadership arrangements have the potential to increase teams ability to adapt, we sought to advance researchers and practitioners understanding and interest in such a leadership arrangements in adaptive teams. We do so by providing a review and integration of previous work on both team adaptability and shared leadership in teams.

Our results suggest that rather than the influence derived from inspirational leadership behaviors, it is employeesa unique relationship with their leader that creates follower engagement. Additionally, we found that follower engagement mediated the relationship between leadership and key employee outcomes (i.e., organizational citizenship behavior and employee turnover intentions).

The data were collected from 296 IT professionals at four well-established IT firms. As we hypothesized, emotion regulation positively affected work engagement, yet this effect disappeared partially when controlling for the role of relational capital (i.e., trust and social interaction). Moreover, servant leadership was found to moderate the relationship between social interaction (i.e., relational capital) and work engagement.

In drawing from Kahns theory of personal engagement, we propose that transformational leadership influences job performance because it inspires higher levels of follower engagement. Our findings reveal that, in addition to psychological meaningfulness, which has been studied extensively as a key motivational mechanism, psychological safety and availability also play important roles in transmitting the effects of transformational leadership to follower engagement, and in turn, job performance. As such, this study provides support for a more integrated motivational theory of transformational leadership.",leadership| engagement| performance

This study synthesizes the individual and group perspectives on engagement to develop and test a multilevel model of engagement and performance in work groups with a sample of 644 employees from 76 groups and their supervisors working in a Fortune 500 company. Group engagement was found to be empirically distinct from, yet positively related to personal engagement. We find that work group engagement was positively related to group performance outcomes, including proficiency, adaptivity, and proactivity. At the individual-level, we find a positive relationship between personal engagement and the individual performance outcomes, including task performance, organizational citizenship performance, and pro-social rule breaking. Finally, we find support for our cross-level mediation hypotheses that personal engagement mediates the relationship between group engagement and individual performance.

We tested our hypotheses with longitudinal, multisource data from 415 employees on 102 teams. In general, LMX and LMXD were found to have opposite effects on their corresponding performance outcomes through a similar process. Specifically, at the individual level, path analysis revealed that LMX promoted positive perception of work role, which in turn predicted customer-rated performance and performance fluctuation through shaping role engagement. At the team level, LMXD led to role perception differentiation (within-group variance in role perception, RPD), which in turn determined role engagement differentiation (within-group variance in role engagement, RED). RED ultimately influenced objective team performance and performance fluctuation via affecting team coordination.

Through semi-structured interviews we determine the different types of identity work employed by these individuals to overcome internal conflict and create new leadership identities, with varying levels of effectiveness.

Moreover, abusive supervision was shown to positively relate with subordinate deviance directed toward both the supervisor and the organization as a whole. Collectively, the present results supported a mediated moderation model in which abusive supervision transmitted the association between supervisor emotional exhaustion and subordinate deviance only when supervisor self-monitoring was relatively low.

With a sample of 193 employee-supervisor dyads from downsized and non-downsized organizations, we tested if individuals with low core self-evaluations and coworker support, as indicators of a submissive posture, are more likely to report instances of abuse, particularly in downsized organizations, where the work environment is characterized by high levels of uncertainty and stress. Moreover, we tested if our model held consequences for employee performance. Our hypotheses were supported, such that as CSE and coworker support decreased, abusive supervision increased, particularly in downsized organizations, and this effect carried over to both in-role and extra-role performance. Using a displaced aggression framework (Hoobler & Brass, 2006), our study contributes to the discussion over the antecedents of abusive supervision by emphasizing the roles played a) by the victim, and b) by the context in which these events take place.",submissive employees| downsizing| abusive supervision

Religiously derived ethics are relevant to managerial behavior because they form a source of our earliest ethical education, valuing integrity as required virtuous behavior, even for individuals unaffiliated with organized religion.  The unrecognized commonalities of these three religions can guide development of integrity within diverse groups of managers and employees in a rapidly globalized world where religious tension is increasing, and workers often confront and have to ethically resolve moral challenges in the workplace.  After examining similarities in these religions' conceptualization of marketplace integrity, the paper compares religiously derived ethical behavior including workplace integrity of employers and employees; environmental integrity and stewardship; integrity of buying, selling, and usury; and social justice and responsibility.

Drawing on a case study on the Amway Corporation Germany, the paper identifies and discusses three inherent forms of misuse: a higher meaning of work may create an illusion, a calling may become totalizing, and viewing an organization as a means to strive for higher values can serve as an exculpation for organizational ills.

This paper presents the difference in individual well-being across these kinds of institutional settings, instrumented by the 2006 Chinese General Social Survey that sampled 28 provinces and 10000 citizens in China. We described individual well-being from objective and subjective perspectives. We measured the objective well-being by income, benefits, working conditions, and career opportunities, and the subjective well-being by individual perception of satisfaction and happiness. In general, we found that (1) people in urban China enjoy more objective well-being than people in rural China, but less subjective well-being; (2) people who work for the public sector enjoy more objective and subjective well-beings than people who work for the for-profit sector; and (3) there is no systematic difference in the levels of both types of well-being between people who work for state-owned and private enterprises.",well-being| sectoral comparison| institution

We examine empirically organization design in a sample of 105 nursing homes in Minnesota, using data obtained from an original survey. The findings generally support our hypotheses. Compared to FP homes, NP and LG homes delegate more decision-making to their employees, NP monitor them more, NP and LG are more likely to use efficiency wages as an alternative to financial incentives, and NP rely more on social networks as a selection tool of employees.

How High Hopes of Diversity May Be Dashed in the Public Sector,1|Eckhard Schroter|Zeppelin U.||2|Patrick von Maravic|Zeppelin U.||,,"There is a strong undercurrent in the rich literature on representative bureaucracy suggesting a positive link between workforce diversity and overall administrative performance. This argument rests mainly on a conceptual linkage between passive and active representation. A bureaucracy is representative in the passive sense if the bureaucracy has the same characteristics as the population on the variables of interest and representative in the active sense if the bureaucracy pursues actions that are in the interest of a certain group. This linkage between passive and active representation serves as a major normative justification for introducing representative bureaucracy. So far a number of students of representative bureaucracy have been able to verify this positive link but only for certain types of organizations, e.g. schools, police force, nursery. For other types of organizations, such as policy-making or those with a planning-oriented task profile, e.g. government departments or regulatory agencies, the effect seems to rather low. We therefore ask, how sustainable is this performance-enhancing claim and how much do we already know about this linkage empirically? In this paper we will argue that the positive effect of representativeness and workforce diversity on organizational performance is highly contingent on task-specific features and institutional characteristics of public organizations.",representative bureaucracy| diversity management| performance

This paper addresses two specific questions: First, how does a policy announcement about budget reduction affect employees attitudes, behaviors and wellbeing at work? Second, as change increases after the policy announcement, how do the perceptions of both change and innovation affect employees attitudes, behaviors and their emotional well-being at work over time?  We use a field study with a quasi-experimental design and longitudinal data to examine these questions, following a UK national government announcement of medium-term budget cuts.  Our results suggest that the policy announcement about budget cuts itself affects individual experiences at work negatively. Further, the actual increase in organizational changes over time not only affected employees attitudes and well-being, but also behaviors such as engagement in the job and public service delivery. However, while the change management literature mainly reports dysfunctional effects of organizational change on employee experience, we find that not all change is necessarily perceived and experienced negatively, and that innovation has positive effects on attitudes, behaviors and well-being at work over time.

The government funds a cluster management to encourage the cooperation of regional firms and institutions within the same or related industries. After a while, firms are expected to finance the cluster management themselves. However, many regional networks fail because firms are not willing to pay for management services. This qualitative study exemplifies the dilemma of cluster managements in top-down clusters by comparing the governance regimes of publicly initiated Bavarian clusters (top-down) with the governance regimes of German and Austrian clusters that are privately initiated (bottom-up). Results show numerous inconsistencies in top-down clusters concerning the assignment of decision rights, the design of the performance evaluation, and the incentives offered, which can explain firms unwillingness to finance cluster management. By contrast, bottom-up clusters seem to have consistent govern-ance regimes, enabling them to provide efficient services for firms.",regional network| governance| willingness to pay

In addition, top-down initiation mainly obstructs the collaboration in a network. Finally, our study strongly supports the framework of Provan and Milward (2001) that differentiates between three levels of network effectiveness.

Proponents of results-based management approaches point to the importance of goal alignment in organizational management systems for increasing organizational performance.  A U.S. Government Accountability Office report recently suggested a key to improving Government through performance information is to create a clear line of sight linking individual performance with organizational results. Measuring individual performance is generally a function of an organization's human resources system which suggests that goal alignment should be built within the agency performance appraisal program.  However, not all agencies are likely to implement performance appraisal goal alignment; multiple factors such as resources, leadership support, climate fit, management guidance, and communication can predict if an agency is likely to have goal alignment.This research examines to what extent do Federal agency organizational factors predict performance appraisal goal alignment? Goal alignment is measured in two ways: first as actual embedding of strategic plan goals into employee performance plans, and second, employee knowledge of how their work relates to the agencys goals and priorities.  This quantitative study uses data gathered by U.S. Office of Personnel Management on Federal agency performance appraisal programs and tests the following organizational factors: Communication, Leadership Support, Climate Fit, Management Guidance, and Strategic Plan Characteristics.  Results of the analysis indicate first, when measuring performance appraisal plan alignment, leadership support of the program is a key determining factor.  Communication of the organizations goals, the climate fit for achieving results, and if the strategic plan was written for the agency program are also predicting factors to employee alignment.",performance appraisals| goal alignment| human resources

To address this problem, the authors conducted an empirical study of the interpretation and use of performance information in local public sector agencies in England, a country where performance measurement has increasingly been used to monitor and improve public services. Findings highlight the emergent construct of performance culture as an explanation for the varying interpretations and uses of performance information. Different meanings were attributed to performance culture at different organizational levels, revealing divergent understandings and uses of performance information between top management and frontline staff. Drawing on these findings, the paper proposes a framework for reducing the persisting ambiguity by harmonizing the culturally embedded interpretations and uses of performance information throughout an organization.",performance| measurement| performance management

Given the variability in the programmatic focus of nonprofit organizations engaged in governance and the wide range of policy tools available to pursue different community reinvestment objectives, democratic accountability of networks within reinvestment contexts are highly variable. The analysis suggests that democratic accountability may better be understood as a function of the organizations, the interests represented and the tools utilized.  The analysis also reveals that in some cases, functional approaches to understanding democratic accountability may be limited and frameworks are necessary that consider the practices and processes in which nonprofit organizations engage to ensure democratic accountability.",governance| nonprofit| networks

When applied to public school improvement, managerial ambidexterity may involve reconfiguring responsibility and risk to offset challenges between policy-informed accountability and professional autonomy. Yet, how responsibility and risk are configured through principals managerial ambidexterity looks different based on principals perception of the schools performance context (task alignment and adaptation readiness) and social context (trust and support readiness), their own managerial capabilities, and strength of external stressors. Drawing from 20 initial principals contacts and then through intensive investigation of 15 school principals, I identify four base organizational profiles perceived by their principals as either too chaotic (political and low systems schools) or too rigid (humanist and high systems schools) and thus affect responsibility and risk distribution differently. Three baseline tools are also identified, affective manipulation, cognitive interpretation, and data use that affect rebalancing.

The first way in which the studied organization used soft power was to attract supportive stakeholders by emphasizing commonly held values through tactics that identify, enable, and guide their achievement.

Two major foci of such efforts have been empowering these individuals and enhancing coordination among service providers.  The path to implementing these goals is not well understood. This study applies an integrative innovation framework to examine how 71 public schools implemented a case management initiative that sought to increase family and agency engagement.  Longitudinal data reveal both substantial state and school support and in some respects contradictions within each.  School-based case managers received ongoing training and consultation in the new model, but were often not evaluated on the basis of implementation fidelity or supported by schools in key program practices.  Local public agencies were mandated to participate in the programs teams but were often not reimbursed for this time and generally had to use separate documentation for the same families. At year five, the program had greatly increased the rate of parent participation in team meetings, but generally did not include local agencies in those meetings. Mixed support from the state and schools as well as parental hesitation about sharing information may help explain why the goal of seamless coordination remains elusive.",integration| innovation implementation| schools

This calls for a better understanding of the process by which job characteristics affect the turnover intent of nonprofit employees and the factors that may moderate these relationships. This study contributes to our understanding by investigating the role of burnout as a mediator in the relationship between job demands and turnover intent, and examining the moderating effects of job control and empowerment. It found that burnout mediates the relationship between job demands and intent to turnover. Empowerment and job control moderate the relationship between job demands and burnout. The implication for management practice is that the stressful and negative effects of demanding jobs can be mitigated by empowering employees.",nonprofit employees| job characteristics| turnover intent

Brown|Griffith U.||,,"Using data from nearly 2000 employees from 118 Australian government agencies who observed and reported perceived organizational wrongdoing, we tested hypotheses derived from a new model describing how observers make attributions about corporate social irresponsibility (CSI) (Lange & Washburn, in press). Results were largely consistent with the model. Employees who observed and reported wrongdoing rated their organizations CSI higher when they assessed higher levels of (a) undesirability of the wrongdoing, (b) organizational culpability in the matter, and (c) non-complicity of affected parties. Employees assessment of effect undesirability was positively associated with their identification with the affected party and negatively associated with their identification with the organization. One implication of these findings is that wrongdoing is not associated inevitably with employee perceptions of irresponsibility, but rather that this depends on a number of factors over which managers have some control. However, the results also suggest an employee may attribute irresponsibility after experiencing only one incident of reported organizational wrongdoing, which in turn could impact both the legitimacy and the overall performance of the organization.",: corporate social irresponsibility| organizational wrongdoing| whistle-blowing

We propose this link occurs through the mediator of work intensification. In addition, we propose that perceived organizational support moderates this mediational model. Using data collected from 2273 participants in a large public sector organization, we find general support for the integrated moderated mediation model. The findings suggest that employee experiences relating to training, fairness of rewards and involvement negatively influence emotional exhaustion through their negative effects on work intensification. The indirect effects are weaker when perceived organizational support is high. Interestingly, we find the opposite conditional effects for performance management and promotional opportunities. This indicates that employees experiences related to performance management and promotion opportunities positively influence emotional exhaustion through their positive effect on work intensification. The indirect effects are stronger when perceived organizational support is low for performance management and high for involvement. The implications and limitations of the findings are discussed.",emotional exhaustion| public sector workers| work intensification

To address this gap in the literature, we interviewed Latin American studies scholars residing in Latin America as well those residing in the US and UK to reveal how and to what extent they participate in the international academic community. Our findings show that the groups differ markedly in terms of personal vision, motivation, research agenda, scholarship focus and preferred outlets for their knowledge production. In particular, Latin American scholars identify as agents of change, motivated by a desire to solve problems and fulfill social needs in the region while scholars residing in the US and UK see themselves as experts in the field, driven by a desire to impact knowledge about the region.

The scholarly literature on this phenomenon is in an embryonic stage and dominated by various discourses. We provide a clear definition of scaling that makes it a subject for mechanism-based scholarly investigation that is grounded in a realist philosophy of science. Realism provides a sophisticated meta-theory that enables explicit operationalization of the causal links between actors, mechanisms and outcomes. To support mechanism-based empirical investigations we develop an analytical model of organizational scaling. The model highlights the importance of explicitly integrating unintended consequences, derailing factors and counterfactuals for valid explanations due to the important limits to social engineering that scholars have highlighted for some time. We discuss implications for qualitative work, provide a general coding scheme, and develop a number of propositions for scaling.",scaling| organizational mechanisms| realism

Scholars have emphasized the importance of employee actions that are not specifically related to the formal description of their job.  These extra-role behaviors can sometimes be described as organizational citizenship behavior (OCB).  This paper examines a type of OCB described as advocacy participation. The central research question I ask is: What drives advocacy participation by public employees?I explore a very specific type of advocacy participation:  encouraging participation in pro-environmental behaviors in the workplace. Drawing on past research, I use public service motivation (PSM), environmental connectedness, and organizational identity (OI) to create a framework to explain individual participation in encouraging pro-environmental behavior in the workplace.  The study uses survey responses from 507 employees of a large city in the southeast United States.   OLS regression is used to model the relationship between the independent variables of interest and encouraging pro-environmental behavior.  The findings suggest that both PSM and environmental connectedness have a positive relationship with encouraging pro-environmental behaviors in the workplace.",public service motivation| organizational citizenship behavior| pro-environmental behavior

In the current study, we explore the boundary conditions under which PSM affects work-related outcomes and theorize that the relationship between PSM and job satisfaction is moderated by the joint effect of POF and the needs-supplies aspect of the person-job fit (NSF). We test our theoretical model in a sample of full-time public sector employees in China and found a significant three-way interaction effect among PSM, NSF, and POF on job satisfaction. Specifically, our findings revealed that the relationship between PSM and job satisfaction was positive for those in a situation with low NSF and low POF, but negative for those in an environment with low NSF and high POF. When PSM, NSF, and POF were all high, professionals in the public sectors had the highest job satisfaction; when PSM, NSF, and POF were all low, they had the lowest job satisfaction. Our research sheds new light on the relationship between PSM and job satisfaction by exploring the possible boundary conditions under which PSM affects work-related outcomes.",public service motivation| job satisfaction| person-organization fit & needs-supply fit

To date, there has been little research that explores how employee attributes, including motivational bases, affect voluntary participation in workplace giving campaigns.  There are two research questions we seek to answer with this research.  First, is an employees public service motivation (PSM) positively related to the amount donated in the workplace?  Second, does an employees level of organizational identification (OI) moderate the effect of PSM on workplace giving?  Answering these questions will help build a preliminary understanding of the motivational drivers of employee workplace giving, an issue important to nonprofit and public management research and practice.  The findings suggest that both PSM and OI have significant direct effects on employee giving.  Furthermore, we find evidence that PSM is conditioned by OI as a moderator with respect to employee giving in workplace campaigns.",non-profit| public service motivation| employee giving

Rational planning models and theories from public choice suggest that using performance information to guide budgeting, report to citizens, and control and reward employees, can improve organizational decision-making, increase citizen control of government, and minimize opportunism in the public sector leading to greater fiscal discipline. If this is the case, ceteris paribus, cities that have adopted performance management should be able to weather the effects of the current fiscal crisis and report lower budget deficits compared to cities with no such systems. Using data from a 2009 International City/County Management Association survey and Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports of some 550 city governments, the statistical analysis shows that performance management practices influence city budget deficits, but the results depend on the estimation method used.",performance measurement and management| local fiscal crisis| city budget deficits

A sample of 336 presidents of CSOs in 20 sports across the province of Ontario, Canada, completed a web-based survey measuring the extent of various elements of human resources capacity (e.g., volunteer attitude, skills, development), infrastructure capacity (formalization, communication, facilities), finance capacity (stable revenues and expenses, financial management, alternate sources), planning capacity, and external relationships capacity (personal connections, engaged/dependable partnerships, bureaucratic/imbalanced partnerships). The survey also measured anticipated change in participation levels over the next three years. Elements representing all five dimensions were significantly associated with change in participation. Planning mediated the impact of sufficient volunteers on this outcome, suggesting that an adequate number of volunteers are necessary to undertake and implement creative long-term planning, which is necessary for increased participation levels in CSOs. The findings highlight the rich information that may be generated from a multidimensional and context-specific perspective on organizational capacity, and indicate implications for building capacity in CSOs.

Against the broader background of sustainability activities in the public sector (e.g., Fiorino, 2010) and corporate social responsibility in the private sector (e.g., Matten, & Moon, 2008), this study contributes to theory by analyzing existing knowledge on how the sustainability concept is nourishing corporate social responsibility and vice versa in the context of public-private partnerships. A qualitative study including two case studies (Denzin, & Lincoln, 2000; Gibbert, Ruigrok, & Wicki, 2008; Yin, 2003) deepens the existing knowledge on the understanding of sustainability by both partners, dimensions of sustainability in public-private partnerships and the partners leadership role.

Using a national survey of nonprofit human service organizations conducted by the Urban Institute, we find a sector is severely stressed.  This paper then considers the meta-contract upon which contracting regime is built: a set of both formal and informal rules, rights, and responsibilities that guide how all parties in a contracting regime are to act.

Johnston|American U.||,,"The contracting tool is used to achieve superior citizen value by outsourcing public service delivery to private and nonprofit firms that are subject to market forces.  In addition to these theorized efficiency gains from competition, accountability in contracting is largely achieved through effective contract management and oversight to hold contractors responsible for their performance.  Yet there is much to be learned about contract implementation.To begin, competition in local public service markets is often weak (Hefetz and Warner fc, Fernandez 2009; Warner and Bel 2008; Amirkhanyan 2007).  As a result, public managers engage in efforts to build and improve the markets from which they purchase public service, that is they manage the market (Warner and Hefetz 2008; Graddy and Chen 2006; Brown and Potoski 2004).  These market management strategies used to establish, expand, and otherwise strengthen competition, create opportunity costs by reducing attention to the primary goal of the contract management process  overseeing performance and maintaining accountability to the public interest.  Our primary objective in this paper is to examine the relationship between market competition and opportunity costs.  We ask two key questions: Do market management and noncompetitive markets contribute to opportunity costs?  And if so, to what extent do those opportunity costs compromise contract effectiveness?  Our analysis relies on a multi-method design using primary survey data from a national sample of city officials, extensive semi-structured interviews and document review from public managers representing multiple service areas.  The results provide comprehensive insights into the front lines of contract management by assessing the opportunity costs associated with contracting in noncompetitive public service markets and the degree to which these opportunity costs detract from contract performance.",contracting| accountability| opportunity costs

Black|Montana State U.||3|Don Greer|Montana State U.||4|David Andersen|State U. of New York, Albany||",,"Recent studies have revealed a wide range of factors that contribute to failure in complex, governmental projects based on multi-party contracts. A major argument is that in complex projects, there are more opportunities for different self-interested parties to exploit the contract, and therefore project failure is likely. The inherent assumption of this argument is that organizations normally lack shared incentives to pursue mutual benefits. We relax this assumption in this multi-method approach investigating the complex nature of governmental projects in the aerospace industries. First, based on analyses of data from 30 semi-structured interviews, we report a case study that identifies five primary causes of miscommunication as viewed by project participants.  Then, drawing on theories of interaction and informed by communication patterns observed in the data, we build a simulation model that represents characteristics of communication across organizational boundaries and conduct a set of additional analyses that explores how communication patterns, not financial incentives, contribute to project failure. The findings show that delays in the iterative nature of communicating in complex projects can impede shared understanding, and therefore drive project failure, even if the organizations truly want to perform effectively for their mutual benefit. The simulation analyses suggest that there is an optimal level for how fast an organization should respond to other parties, which interacts with the level of communication clarity. The implications are that efforts to build shared financial incentives for project outcomes will be insufficient to achieve successful collective action from complex contracting, and attention should be also paid to creating incentives, processes, and skills to improve communication and increase shared understanding across organizations throughout projects.",shared understanding| complex projects| contracting

We tested the model using cross-sectional data from the National Administration Studies Project (NASP)-III, containing 1,220 employees from public and nonprofit organizations. The results show that organizational identification predicted by perceived organizational identity and construed external image is positively related to extra-role behavior, while it is negatively related to employee absenteeism in both public and nonprofit organizations. These findings support the prepositions from organizational studies about the linkage between organizational image, organizational identification, and employee behavior (Katz, 1964).

Using a policy capturing methodology involving both qualitative and quantitative data, the study investigated perceived obligations stemming from two dimensions of employee characteristics: affective commitment to the organization and career stage. Ordinary least squares regression analysis showed that organizational commitment was significantly related to perceived obligations of employers to provide certain kinds of rewards, such as development opportunities. Career stage was significantly related to perceptions of employees' obligations to work late to meet a deadline. The findings suggest that nonprofit employers should consider ways to ""reward"" employees with sufficient opportunities to utilize their skills.

Managers perceived increased turnover to be the organizational outcome of unrealistic expectations among younger workers. Person-organization values fit findings suggest areas where the younger worker employment relationship is effective (training and career development), partially effective (societal contribution; selection and promotion processes), and ineffective (immediacy in workplace processes).

Social ventures have gained importance in the third sector, due to public budget cuts and the subsequent marketization of charitable organizations. So far, entrepreneurial activities of third sector organizations have mainly been studied on the individual level, focusing on the individual social entrepreneur and his start-up. We apply the organization-level construct of entrepreneurial orientation, usually found in corporate entrepreneurship literature, to explore the role of entrepreneurial elements in the pre-start up phase of venture creation of a large nonprofit organization. Drawing on the narrative analysis of interviews and archival data, we describe how a venture is formatted along the elements of entrepreneurial orientation: proactive behavior, innovativeness, out-sourcing risk and collaboration. However, our results suggest that the dimensions of entrepreneurial behavior in the venture-creation process of nonprofit organizations vary in meaning by contrast to those in a for-profit context and emphasize the importance of integration of up- and downstream processes.",entrepreneurial orientation| social venture creation| social intrapreneurship

Through a detailed case study from a UK Local Government organisation, where an individual entrepreneur attempted to drive radical service transformation, the paper will illustrate that despite considerable external support failure to engage and gain internal support and social cohesion resulted in a reduction of power.  This led to less than full implementation of a key change programme together with the loss of support for the entrepreneur which in turn reduced the sustainability of both the activity and the individual within the organisation.  The case study analysis highlights key differences of the public sector context prevent the traditional characteristics of entrepreneurship to be recognised and transferred.

First, an analysis of repeated interviews with 14 participants illustrates how individuals experience enhancement and conflict among identities. Second, through an analysis of longitudinal pre- and post-event survey with 69 participants, we identified different clusters of participants and find that those who experienced high enhancement within a subset of their identities, but the least amount of conflict overall, exhibited greatest task performance. In contrast, participants who experienced the highest enhancement across all their identities despite some levels of conflict, held the most positive attitudes towards the organization.
