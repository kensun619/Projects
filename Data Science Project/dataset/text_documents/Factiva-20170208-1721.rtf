All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PACHINKO\par \par \uc2 By Min Jin Lee\par \par \uc2 490 pp. Grand Central Publishing. $27.\par \par \uc2 Min Jin Lee's stunning novel ''Pachinko'' -- her second, after ''Free Food for Millionaires'' (2007) -- announces its ambitions right from the opening sentence: ''History has failed us, but no matter.''\par \par \uc2 ''Pachinko'' chronicles four generations of an ethnic Korean family, first in Japanese-occupied Korea in the early 20th century, then in Japan itself from the years before World War II to the late 1980s. The novel opens with an arranged marriage in Yeongdo, a fishing village at the southern tip of Korea. That union produces a daughter, Sunja, who falls in love at 16 with a prominent (and married) mobster. After Sunja becomes pregnant, a local pastor offers her a chance to escape by marrying him and immigrating together to his brother's house in an ethnic Korean neighborhood in Osaka. Together, they embark into the fraught unknown.\par \par \uc2 Pachinko, the slot-machine-like game ubiquitous throughout Japan, unifies the central concerns of identity, homeland and belonging. For the ethnic Korean population in Japan, discriminated against and shut out of traditional occupations, pachinko parlors are the primary mode of finding work and accumulating wealth. Called Zainichi, or foreign residents, ethnic Koreans are required to reapply for alien registration cards every three years even if they were born in Japan, and are rarely granted passports, making overseas travel nearly impossible. From a young age, Sunja's oldest son sees being Korean as ''a dark, heavy rock''; his greatest, secret desire is to be Japanese. His younger brother, Mozasu, even after he accumulates great wealth through his pachinko parlors, confides to his closest Japanese friend: ''In Seoul, people like me get called Japanese bastards, and in Japan, I'm just another dirty Korean no matter how much money I make or how nice I am.'' Mozasu's son, Solomon, learns this too quickly after graduating from an American \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2 . He returns to Tokyo on an expat package with the Japanese branch of a British investment bank, then is fired once his ethnic Korean connections are no longer needed for a business deal. Still, Solomon is of a new, less wounded generation. He believes there are still good Japanese people and sees himself as Japanese, too, ''even if the Japanese didn't think so.''\par \par \uc2 Like most memorable novels, however, ''Pachinko'' resists summary. In this sprawling book, history itself is a character. ''Pachinko'' is about outsiders, minorities and the politically disenfranchised. But it is so much more besides. Each time the novel seems to find its locus -- Japan's colonization of Korea, World War II as experienced in East Asia, Christianity, family, love, the changing role of women -- it becomes something else. It becomes even more than it was.\par \par \uc2 Despite the compelling sweep of time and history, it is the characters and their tumultuous lives that propel the narrative. Small details subtly reveal the characters' secret selves and build to powerful moments. After Sunja arrives in Osaka, her modest life is underscored when she enters what is only the second restaurant of her life. When her husband, Isak, is finally cleared of trumped-up charges and released from jail looking ''both new and ancient,'' their oldest son is ''unable to take his eyes off his father for fear he'd disappear.'' Their reunion is moving yet understated: Isak simply holds his son's hand and says: ''My dear boy. My blessing.''\par \par \uc2 Dozens more characters amplify the vortex of points of views: a hostess bar girl, a farmer who has ''no wish for the war to end just yet'' so that he can benefit from the higher black-market prices to realize ''his grandfather's dearest wish'' of buying the adjoining land. The numerous shifts are occasionally jolting, but what is gained is a compassionate, clear gaze at the chaotic landscape of life itself. In this haunting epic tale, no one story seems too minor to be briefly illuminated. Lee suggests that behind the facades of wildly different people lie countless private desires, hopes and miseries, if we have the patience and compassion to look and listen.\par \par \uc2 Krys Lee is the author of the novels ''Drifting House'' and ''How I Became a North Korean.''\par \par \uc2 Min Jin Lee (PHOTOGRAPH BY ELENA SEIBERT) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020170205ed2500067\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

KIRP \par \uc2 1,234 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 February 2017\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 7\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 As soon as I walked into Celia Rojas's prekindergarten class in Union City, N.J., I was sucked in by the hum of activity. Art plastered the walls, plants were hanging from the ceiling, and in every nook there was something to seize a child's imagination. Some kids were doing cutouts of paper clothing and others were at an easel, painting. A bunch of children were solving puzzles on a computer, while another group was building a pink cardboard chair, which they called ''A Chair for My Mother.'' In the reading nook a girl was learning about how, when the wasp larva hatches, it eats the spider. Three classmates were playing dress-up, trying on old felt hats and checking themselves out in the mirror.\par \par \uc2 The teacher was everywhere -- praising kids, offering suggestions when they were stumped and, sometimes, peacemaking. Two boys were peering at insects through a microscope when they started fighting over who got to look next. Ms. Rojas deftly diverted them. ''How many parts does an insect body have?'' she asked. The boys knew: ''Three parts -- the antenna, abdomen and legs.''\par \par \uc2 ''How about an insect salad -- would you want to eat it?'' she inquired. ''Ugh,'' the boys chorused. ''Why not -- are they bad for you?'' she asked. The boys thought about it. ''Maybe if you chopped them up they'd be O.K.,'' one volunteered.\par \par \uc2 At that moment I wished that I were 4 years old and could join the festivities.\par \par \uc2 But most pre-K classrooms look entirely different. After surveying preschools nationwide, Robert Pianta, dean of the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Virginia Curry School of Education, concluded that ''superficial task demands, including giving directions and assigning routine tasks, predominate over children's involvement in appropriate conceptual or class-based activities.''\par \par \uc2 A preschool in Chicago that I visited a few years earlier boasted that it was certified by the \uc2 National Association for the Education of Young Children\uc2 , the pre-K equivalent of the \uc2 Good Housekeeping\uc2  seal. But it didn't merit that encomium. A big room that might once have been a storeroom had been split into mini-classrooms, each about 15 feet square, separated by chest-high partitions. Noise reverberated throughout the building.\par \par \uc2 ''Stay within the lines,'' a teacher commanded a 3-year-old boy. ''You're not tracing the triangle.'' After he started coloring, she returned, exasperated. ''You weren't paying attention during circle time. Only color the triangles, not the circle or the heart.'' The teacher turned to me. ''I like the kids when they stay within the lines and color beautiful,'' she said. In another class, children were told to paint the bottom section of a pyramid. The directions were the same: Stay within the lines. It turned out that the kids were painting the food pyramid, but they didn't know that's what they were doing.\par \par \uc2 What I saw made me wish that I could round up a passel of children and make a run for safety. \uc2 Deborah Stipek\uc2 , a professor of education at Stanford, makes the point more bluntly: ''What I see in a lot of preschools is much worse than coloring between the lines. It's teachers yelling at kids all day.''\par \par \uc2 These two prekindergartens serve very different populations, but perhaps not the ones you might expect. The ''stay within the lines'' pre-K enrolls mainly middle-class youngsters, whose parents pay to send them there, while Ms. Rojas's classroom is in a public school in a poor immigrant community.\par \par \uc2 Though I've spent many hours crouching in these classrooms, I'm no expert. What I witnessed should be obvious to any mom or dad. That's why, even if you are an anxiety-ridden parent, you can rapidly determine whether you want to send your child to a particular preschool. You may also be able to save a boatload of money, since public preschools are often as good as their $30,000 alternatives.\par \par \uc2 When you walk in the door of a prekindergarten, check out the walls -- they should be festooned with children's projects, and not, as is too often the case, plastered with posters that are calculated to please adults and mounted too high for 4-year-olds to see. Look around. There should be lots of different things for children to do.\par \par \uc2 If the kids say hello, and quickly return to what they have been doing, that's a good sign, for it suggests that they're developing social skills. But if they mob you, you have your answer: This isn't the place for your child. You might consider yourself to be a fascinating person, but you shouldn't be more interesting than whatever activity these 3- and 4-year-olds are engaged in.\par \par \uc2 Is the class pin-drop silent? I've talked with well-to-do parents who equate obedience with quality, but unless you want your child in boot camp, that's unhealthy. (Of course, running wild isn't a good thing either; that stored-up energy belongs on the playground.) Kids should be quiet, if a bit squirmy, during circle time, when they are gathered around their teacher. But mostly they should be engaged with one another, because that's when most learning occurs. Their teacher should be talking with them, not at them.\par \par \uc2 And if the classroom looks like a healthy mix of kids from different backgrounds, that's all to the good. Children learn a lot from their classmates, and kids with different experiences have much to contribute to one another.\par \par \uc2 That's it, more or less. If you have a chance to talk briefly with the teacher, ask her how she decides to spend time with one group or another. Inquire about how she handles children who haven't fully learned how, as the argot goes, to use their words, take turns or share. While the answer matters, you mostly want to make sure she has really thought about those things. Winging it doesn't make for good teaching.\par \par \uc2 I imagine many readers believe that I've committed heresy. To them, Montessori or HighScope, Reggio Emilia or Waldorf, or some other school of pre-K pedagogy embodies the Holy Grail. But there's no reason to believe that one of these is better than the others.\par \par \uc2 The key is how well a particular model of teaching is being carried out. A class can be a joy when the teacher truly understands how properly to use, say, the HighScope approach, which has the children decide what they want to do that day, then tackle the chosen project and later review what they've learned. But these techniques are devilishly hard to pull off. When done badly the result is a mighty mess. That's why the school district in the first example allows the best teachers to design a curriculum that, while borrowing from well-vetted approaches, makes the most sense for their kids.\par \par \uc2 For parents, the bottom line is simple: Watch closely what's happening in the classroom, pick a preschool that you wish you had gone to, and your child will do just fine.\par \par \uc2 David L.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc2}{\*\bkmkend toc2}\b \uc2 Judge Denounced by Trump Is Known for Independence\b0\par\par\uc2 By THOMAS FULLER \par \uc2 648 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 February 2017\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 13\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The federal judge who blocked President Trump's immigration order is described by former colleagues and acquaintances as a ''mainstream'' Republican who went from a career as a highly respected corporate lawyer in Seattle to an appointment by President George W. Bush to the federal bench.\par \par \uc2 The order on Friday by the judge, James Robart of Federal District Court in Seattle, reversed the president's executive order restricting immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries. It stirred the ire of Mr. Trump, who in a \uc2 Twitter\uc2  post on Saturday denigrated Judge Robart as a ''so-called judge'' and described the judge's order as ''ridiculous.''\par \par \uc2 Lawyers in Seattle describe Judge Robart, 69, as a disciplined ''judge's judge'' who is unafraid of passing down unpopular rulings.\par \par \uc2 Michael D. McKay, a former United States attorney who is active in Republican politics in Washington State, called Judge Robart ''a smart, thoughtful guy and very even-tempered.''\par \par \uc2 ''The cream rises to the top,'' Mr. McKay said.\par \par \uc2 Jenny A. Durkan, another former United States attorney, who served during the Obama administration, described Judge Robart as ''a very strict federal judge who believes in the rule of law.''\par \par \uc2 ''I think he truly believes in the independence of the judiciary, to the marrow of his bones,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 She added that Judge Robart, who earned his law degree at \uc2 Georgetown \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2 , needed to be seen in the context of the moderate Republican traditions of the Pacific Northwest.\par \par \uc2 One of Judge Robart's highest-profile cases in recent years has been his oversight of a federal decree that requires the Seattle Police Department to address allegations of excessive force and bias. During an oversight hearing last year, he cited the high number of deaths of African-Americans in officer-involved shootings. ''Black lives matter,'' the judge told the courtroom emphatically.\par \par \uc2 Mr. McKay and Ms. Durkan were the leaders of a bipartisan selection committee that vetted Mr. Robart and recommended to the Bush administration in 2003 that he be appointed. He was confirmed the next year in the Senate by a vote of 99 to 0.\par \par \uc2 The vetting committee, which includes an equal number of Republicans and Democrats, is peculiar to Washington State and was set up in the mid-1990s, when President \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2  was in the White House and Congress was under Republican control.\par \par \uc2 The Washington senators at the time -- Patty Murray, a Democrat, and Slade Gorton, a Republican -- established the committee as a bipartisan compromise.\par \par \uc2 ''We could essentially live with any of the names put forward,'' Mr. Gorton, who retired from the Senate in 2001, said in an interview on Saturday. ''Both Patty Murray and I felt that we were getting good judges. We weren't getting judges who were personal enemies or who were personally obnoxious to us.''\par \par \uc2 The system has worked well for two decades, he said, but he added that he was ''not sure'' whether it would continue under Mr. Trump.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Robart was one of Seattle's leading trial lawyers and the head of the law firm Lane Powell when he was selected to join the federal bench. While in private practice, he was admitted to the American College of Trial Lawyers, a prestigious, invitation-only group known for its rigorous vetting.\par \par \uc2 ''He was a person who valued the opinions of his colleagues,'' said Chuck Riley, the current head of Lane Powell, who worked with Judge Robart there for more than a decade. ''He had an open door.''\par \par \uc2 During Senate confirmation proceedings, Mr. Robart was praised for his ''exceptional qualifications'' by Senator \uc2 Orrin G. Hatch\uc2 , Republican of Utah, then the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\par \par \uc2 ''He brings a wealth of trial experience to the federal bench,'' said Mr. Hatch, who added that Mr. Robart had helped represent ''the disadvantaged'' and had helped Southeast Asian refugees.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020170205ed2500062\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDEDAt first, \uc2 Hillsdale College\uc2  seems to resemble dozens of other small liberal arts schools with rich histories. There are statues of Washington and Lincoln, Jefferson and Churchill, and a monument to students who fought for the Union -- a point of pride at a college that was founded by abolitionists, visited by the crusading former slave Frederick Douglass and open to black students and women from its founding in 1844.\par \par \uc2 Cross the quad on what is known as the Liberty Walk, though, and you encounter something different: statues of \uc2 Margaret Thatcher\uc2  and Ronald Reagan. If it isn't ready to add a bronzed Donald J. Trump to this pantheon, this is one college, at least, where his presidency is viewed with more hope than dread. In a letter to prospective donors, Hillsdale's president, \uc2 Larry P. Arnn\uc2 , said that 2017 promises a ''beginning to restore limited government.''\par \par \uc2 Hillsdale, a private college of 1,400 students in southern Michigan that describes itself as ''nonsectarian Christian'' and dedicated to ''civil and religious liberty,'' is scarcely known in many circles. But among erudite conservatives -- think progeny of William F. Buckley Jr. -- it is considered a hidden gem.\par \par \uc2 What they admire is the college's concentration on the Western philosophical and literary canon (sometimes disparaged as the Great Books of dead white men) and its reverent treatment of the American founding documents as the political culmination of that tradition -- a tradition that scholars at Hillsdale say has been desecrated by a century of governmental overreach, including the New Deal and Obamacare.\par \par \uc2 It is no coincidence that Justice \uc2 Clarence Thomas\uc2 , an advocate of strict ''originalist'' interpretation of the Constitution, delivered the commencement address last spring, likening Hillsdale to a ''shining city on a hill'' for its devotion to ''liberty as an antecedent of government, not a benefit from government.''\par \par \uc2 Conservatives are also entranced by Hillsdale's decision to forgo any federal or state funds so as to be ''unfettered'' by government mandates. In 1984, in \uc2 Grove City College\uc2  v. Bell, the Supreme Court ruled that even Pell grants for needy students or G.I. Bill money for veterans subjects a college to federal regulations, and so Hillsdale students are not allowed to accept such funds (most receive institutional grants). As a result, the college does not follow Title IX guidelines on sex discrimination and the handling of sexual assault cases and it has refused to engage in the otherwise required reporting on student race and ethnicity, let alone develop an affirmative action plan. Not surprisingly, the school's ''race blind'' admissions policy results in an overwhelmingly white student body.\par \par \uc2 George F. Will, the conservative columnist, praised both the college's independence and its curriculum, saying that ''by stressing the Great Books and Western civilization, Hillsdale has become a niche success.'' He added: ''I think it's greatly regrettable that it's only a niche.''\par \par \uc2 The election of Mr. Trump, claiming a conservative mantle but with an erratic record, has forced questions about the true meaning of conservatism into the spotlight. Under the leadership of Dr. Arnn, a prominent conservative intellectual, Hillsdale has been working not only to provide an example in the classroom but also to press its stance nationally on what it calls the threats to constitutional liberty -- ideas that feed into conservative Republican politics.\par \par \uc2 The most popular of Hillsdale's free online courses, Constitution 101 -- 10 weeks of lectures by faculty members, with recommended readings -- has been taken by more than 800,000, according to the college, and has offered intellectual ballast to Tea Party activists. ''By educating millions of Americans on our founding principles of liberty,'' the college writes of its goals, ''America can begin to turn around and restore lost liberty.''\par \par \uc2 In Washington, Hillsdale plays an active role in an ecosystem of conservative thought and policy. It joined with \uc2 the Heritage Foundation\uc2  to run a fellowship program for congressional staff members. Its D.C. outpost, the Allan P. Kirby Jr. Center for Constitutional Studies and Citizenship, runs a lecture series and serves as a base for Hillsdale undergraduates who are interning at conservative think tanks or publications. Aiming to nurture its vision of classical education, the college has also helped establish K-12 charter schools across the country.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Arnn arrived at Hillsdale in 2000 as a healer on a campus rocked by scandal (his predecessor had resigned after publicity over an alleged affair and a suicide). Previously president of the Claremont Institute, a conservative think tank in California, Dr. Arnn seems to personify Hillsdale, teaching the ancient Greeks and Shakespeare and publishing books on Churchill and the Constitution. An ebullient man with a short beard who speaks with faint traces of his native Arkansas, he has been known to swoop down on hapless victims in the cafeteria and pose the core question of the Classics: ''What is The Good?''\par \par \uc2 In his office, beneath a portrait of Churchill, he did not gush over Mr. Trump but stressed what he sees as the overriding imperative. ''If he attacks the regulatory state,'' Dr. Arnn said, ''that will be for the good.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump's rise has posed the same quandary on this campus as it has among conservatives beyond it. Dr. Arnn's decision last year to endorse him raised eyebrows on a divided campus and in wider circles (National Review had famously declared ''Never Trump''). Mr. Trump had even considered Dr. Arnn for secretary of education, but he was ultimately passed over.\par \par \uc2 ''People said to me, 'You love Abraham Lincoln and Winston Churchill, how can you support Trump?' I said, 'I didn't know they were in the race.' ''\par \par \uc2 After election night, the campus did not see weeping, nor wide rejoicing. A survey of students by the school paper found that just 49 percent had voted for Mr. Trump; others voted for third-party candidates or did not vote; 4 percent voted for \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 . By comparison, 90 percent of students voted for \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  in 2012. But perhaps only at Hillsdale would a student cite Aristotle's emphasis on ''the practicality of prudence'' in an op-ed urging classmates to get behind the new president.\par \par \uc2 Hillsdale attracts students from across the country (only a third are from Michigan), and they don't wind up there by accident. Many said their parents received Hillsdale's newsletter, Imprimis, featuring speeches by conservative thinkers. Some said they had heard Dr. Arnn on one of his regular appearances on Hugh Hewitt's syndicated radio program. They were also attracted by the moderate cost. Hillsdale is well financed with private donations, and college officials said that 95 percent of students this year received grants averaging $17,206, to offset the $35,722 for tuition, room and board.\par \par \uc2 In a commonly expressed sentiment, Kaitlyn Johns, a senior economics major with a music minor, said she came to Hillsdale ''because I felt like I would actually be challenged here.'' Tara Ung, a junior, chose Hillsdale because of the classics emphasis. A political science major ''with a Latin minor for fun,'' she said she particularly enjoyed her internship in Washington with the \uc2 Cato Institute\uc2 , a libertarian think tank, and was now helping to form an undergraduate chapter of the \uc2 Federalist Society\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In this isolated location, students like to form clubs, on everything from politics to cigar smoking to highland dancing. One that does not exist at \uc2 Hillsdale College\uc2  is an L.G.B.T.Q. organization. Openly gay or lesbian students are a rarity, and The \uc2 Princeton Review\uc2  consistently ranks Hillsdale among the 20 least L.G.B.T.Q.-friendly campuses.\par \par \uc2 A public furor erupted in 2015 when the chaplain sent out a campuswide email calling for prayer against the ''evil'' and ''ugly'' possibility that the Supreme Court would legalize same-sex marriage. College leaders admonished him for his tenor, though not the message: ''The tone and language of the email did not properly represent our commitment to thoughtful inquiry and civil discussion,'' the provost, \uc2 David M. Whalen\uc2 , said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 Founded by Free Will Baptists, the college wears its religion lightly, without requiring a pledge of faith like some evangelical institutions. The student body includes a significant minority of Roman Catholics; students studying the Reformation in their core curriculum joke about re-enacting its debates over lunch. Classes are small and personal. ''The entire freshman class is reading the same stuff at the same time, and the class spills over into the lunchroom,'' said Paul A. Rahe, a history professor.\par \par \uc2 The soul of Hillsdale is its core curriculum, which largely occupies students for their first two years. It includes more than a dozen mandatory survey courses on topics like the Western heritage (with readings from Hammurabi to Hobbes) and American heritage (the Mayflower Compact to inaugural addresses by Franklin D. Roosevelt and Reagan). Students also must study core principles of biology, chemistry and physics and take the trademark class on the American Constitution.\par \par \uc2 Beyond admiring the stress on traditional rigor and methods, conservatives more widely venerate the Great Books, approached in a certain way. They laud the reading of original texts, gleaning eternal ideas of right and wrong rather than dwelling on the often less noble historical contexts. Hence, the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution are exalted for recognizing the natural rights of man and role of government as protector of those rights. The Constitution's enshrinement of slavery, in this view, was a horrid expediency to win adoption in the South -- a malignancy that ultimately had to be excised in blood rather than an indelible original sin.\par \par \uc2 ''In principle, studying Great Books is not inherently conservative,'' said Molly Worthen, an assistant professor of history at the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who laments that this ground has been largely ceded by liberals.\par \par \uc2 ''There is a tradition that grew out of ancient Greece and Rome that is shared by modern progressives,'' she said. ''But the study of the Great Books has become entwined with a certain set of methodological assumptions and political or ideological goals.''\par \par \uc2 In a telling moment during my campus visit, a student tour guide brought a prospective student and her parents to the rare-book room in the library. ''I'd learned in class about Tocqueville's idea of the danger posed to liberty by overvaluing equality, and how that is relevant today,'' the guide said. ''This was really brought home to me, seeing an original translation of Tocqueville here in the Heritage Room.''\par \par \uc2 The guide could have learned that point in the class that Dr. Rahe taught last fall, a deep dive into Montesquieu, Rousseau and Tocqueville with the suggestive title drawn from one of the professor's books: ''Soft Despotism, Democracy's Drift.''\par \par \uc2 Still, in several classes that I observed, the teachers encouraged spirited exchanges and broached topics far beyond conservative dogma. Dr. Whalen, for example, an English professor as well as provost, ended his course ''Great Books in Continental Literature'' with a look at Samuel Beckett's ''Endgame.'' ''What happens if there is no meaning there, but you have an absurd need to express meaning?'' he asked of Beckett's vision. One student drew a comparison to the music of John Cage, which he had studied in another class.\par \par \uc2 The course on the Constitution includes intense study of the Federalist papers and the later statements of Progressives like John Dewey, Woodrow Wilson and F.D.R. Hillsdale teachings describe the Constitution as a timeless document whose principles have been compromised by the creep of welfare and regulation.\par \par \uc2 The more mainstream view is offered by Joseph J. Ellis, author of several books on the founders, who he says intended that the Constitution be ''a living document.'' ''The conservative narrative,'' he told me, ''defies the evolution of the United States into a major industrial superpower that requires federal institutions to regulate corporations and manage a much larger set of interests.''\par \par \uc2 If one subject captures the juxtaposition of Hillsdale's pathbreaking origins with its present-day conservatism, it is race. From the official catalog: ''The college values the merit of each unique individual, rather than succumbing to the dehumanizing, discriminatory trend of so-called 'social justice' and 'multicultural diversity.' ''\par \par \uc2 In 2013, Dr. Arnn was castigated by Michigan legislators when, during testimony against the Common Core, he made a remark about officials who questioned Hillsdale's racial record. Years before, he said scornfully, Michigan officials had come to the campus with clipboards, trying to count faces and prove, he said, that the college ''didn't have enough dark ones.'' He later issued a barbed apology: ''No offense was intended by the use of that term except to the offending bureaucrats.''\par \par \uc2 To me, Dr. Arnn said: ''I think it is an urgent thing for the college to help those who are disadvantaged.'' He cited the charter school initiative as a response that fits Hillsdale's values. Hillsdale has received private grants to foster K-12 schools, funded with public money, that introduce children to the ancient Greeks and constitutional principles and require the study of Latin. Hillsdale serves as a consultant -- without payment, again avoiding government funds -- providing local organizers a curriculum and teacher training. So far it is aiding 16 schools -- three of them, one in Georgia and two in Texas, serving mainly minority populations, Dr. Arnn said.\par \par \uc2 ''We hope that a lot of those students will come here,'' he said. In the meantime, Hillsdale defiantly claims an exemplary record of opposition to racial discrimination. As if to drive home the point, the college is adding one more bronze to its Liberty Walk this spring: a statue of Frederick Douglass.\par \par \uc2 Correction: February 5, 2017, Sunday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Page 16 this weekend about Hillsdale, a conservative college in Michigan, misspells the surname of a student who chose it because of its emphasis on classics. She is Tara Ung, not Ang.\par \par \uc2 Erik Eckholm is a former editor and reporter for The Times who most recently covered national legal affairs.\par \par \uc2 FOUNDATIONAL WORK: Constitution 101 is part of Hillsdale's rigorous core curriculum.

Our elected leaders not only exercised their power to liberate and protect certain groups, they also used it to punish those same groups when the larger citizenry began to fear or resent their mere presence. It was evident when the country took the land and the lives of a once-thriving Native American population, and again when the government endorsed the internment of innocent Japanese-American families during World War II; it can be seen again today, as a new president uses rhetoric that demonizes Muslim American citizens. In her brilliantly researched ''The Original Black Elite: Daniel Murray and the Story of a Forgotten Era,'' Elizabeth Dowling Taylor recounts the rise of African-Americans during the time of Reconstruction and their fall during the subsequent decades, when legislation was advanced in order to again segregate, impoverish and humiliate a population that many whites believed had gained too much.\par \par \uc2 By tracing the ascent of Daniel Murray, the wealthy black civic leader, businessman and assistant librarian at the \uc2 Library of Congress\uc2 , Taylor reveals how black Americans after the Civil War benefited from opportunities afforded by Reconstruction policies. Out of this environment of tolerance grew a strong and dignified black community in Washington, where the black elite could advance in prominent jobs, build successful businesses, pursue education for themselves and their children, and purchase imposing homes.\par \par \uc2 Although Daniel Murray was born free in 1851 -- his father was a black lumberyard worker who had been manumitted in 1810, and his mother was a free woman of color -- in Taylor's prologue we are first introduced to a 48-year-old Murray. By 1899, he was already a prominent government appointee, who had worked at the \uc2 Library of Congress\uc2  for more than 25 years and then served as one of its second-highest-ranking officials, assistant librarian. Murray had a seat on Washington's Board of Trade, a group of otherwise white businessmen that advised the government on taxation in the nation's capital. His wife, Anna Evans, was a confident black socialite who taught at local schools, attended \uc2 Oberlin College\uc2  and happened to be related to the highly regarded black United States senator Hiram Revels of Mississippi. Murray had sons who would later attend Harvard and Cornell. He had the ear of white co-workers and business leaders, and he often met with white congressmen and their staffers who needed his guidance when researching legislative history in the library's archives.\par \par \uc2 On the morning of Oct. 2, 1899, Murray -- dressed in a silk top hat and a Prince Albert coat -- had just descended the steps of his three-story red-brick home in northwest D.C. and was on his way to board a plushly outfitted train car. The 40-some passengers -- all white, except for Murray -- made up a special welcoming committee appointed by President William McKinley, on the occasion of honoring Admiral George Dewey for his victory in Manila Bay. Despite an initial picture that suggests Murray embraced clich\u195\'00\'C3\u169\'00\'A9s of racial tranquillity, Taylor makes clear throughout her book that Murray and most of his black elite friends ''did not crave the company of white people.'' Taylor, an independent scholar and the author of ''A Slave in the White House: Paul Jennings and the Madisons,'' understands the mind-set of the black elite, and she quickly points out that despite his own rise to the top, ''Daniel Murray was 'a race man to the core' '':\par \par \uc2 ''If he took any pride in being the first black man to join this organization or the only one to be invited to that social occasion, his greater goal, his long-range vision, was to be in the vanguard of merit-based recognition for every American of color. The rise of those in Murray's black elite circle was realized rather than potential. Its members had attained high levels of education, achievement, culture.\u226\'00\'E2\u8364\'20\'AC\u710\'02\'C6.\u226\'00\'E2\u8364\'20\'AC\u710\'02\'C6.\u226\'00\'E2\u8364\'20\'AC\u710\'02\'C6. They were living proof that African-Americans did not lack the ability to become useful contributors to mainstream society.''\par \par \uc2 As Taylor traces Murray's pre-Civil War childhood in Baltimore and his subsequent move to Washington, it becomes clear that his success -- getting hired and promoted for his government job, purchasing real estate and building a reputation in the business community -- was due to timing, connections and his ability to network with both whites and blacks. His older half brother, Samuel Proctor, was not only a successful Washington caterer whose client list included President Abraham Lincoln, but also the proprietor of one of the two restaurants in the Capitol. Because the restaurant, known as ''the Senate Saloon,'' was located in the Senate wing, Murray was afforded the chance to make casual acquaintance with senators and members of their staffs once he began working there in 1869, when he was 18. It was opportunities like this -- in a more liberal, Republican-led government -- that aided Murray's rise. And unlike many other cities with large African-American populations, Baltimore and Washington provided the ideal environment for upwardly mobile blacks. At the time of Murray's birth, 90 percent of the blacks living in Baltimore were free, giving it the largest free black population in the country. Washington, for its part, was a hub for the black elite because of the large number of government jobs and the establishment of \uc2 Howard \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2 , a magnet for black intellectuals and civic leaders.\par \par \uc2 Taylor knows how to weave an emotional story of how race and class have long played a role in determining who succeeds and who fails. We get to meet many of Murray's friends and acquaintances, other members of the black elite. Howard's law school dean Richard T. Greener was a successful attorney after attending Phillips Academy and then \uc2 Harvard \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2 ; he became Harvard's first black graduate in 1870. James Wormley owned the Wormley Hotel, a luxury establishment that opened in 1871 and catered to affluent white visitors. (In a bitter irony, it was also the reported site of the Hayes-Tilden Compromise of 1877, which marked the end of Reconstruction.) The newspaper publisher Pinckney Pinchback served as lieutenant governor and acting governor of Louisiana, and owned a mansion near the Chinese Embassy. Calvin Brent was Washington's first African-American architect. The civil rights activist Mary Church Terrell graduated from \uc2 Oberlin College\uc2  in 1884; her father was recognized as the first black millionaire in the South, and her husband was the first black municipal court judge in Washington. We also meet the United States senator Blanche Bruce of Mississippi, who later served appointments under four presidents.\par \par \uc2 But the reader shouldn't expect a happy ending in ''The Original Black Elite.'' The rug of opportunity and dignity was abruptly pulled out from under the nation's African-American population. Murray and his circle watched nervously as white politicians and their own neighbors betrayed them. Angry white Southerners and the Ku Klux Klan claimed that blacks had come too far; Jim Crow laws denied African-Americans access to specific jobs, public facilities, restaurants, transportation; and cynical politicians galvanized white support by publicly demonizing African-Americans. After taking office in March 1913, Woodrow Wilson oversaw the segregation of federal offices, demoting and firing black employees; the few who were allowed to stay were suddenly required to use ''colored only'' bathrooms and eating areas.\par \par \uc2 Murray's life spanned the beginning and the end of an era. While he enjoyed many years of integrated experiences in Washington, just 12 years after Wilson's inauguration and 74 years after he was born, Taylor writes, ''Daniel Murray died in a segregated hospital and was buried in a segregated graveyard.''\par \par \uc2 Lawrence Otis Graham is an attorney and the author of ''Our Kind of People: Inside America's Black Upper Class'' and ''The Senator and the Socialite: The True Story of America's First Black Dynasty.''\par \par \uc2 Daniel Murray at about age 60.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- Judge Neil M. Gorsuch's first taste of rough-and-tumble Washington politics was bitter and lingering.\par \par \uc2 He was 15 years old and his mother was a high-ranking official in the Reagan administration caught in an ugly showdown with Congress. When she was forced to step down, her reputation in tatters, young Neil was furious.\par \par \uc2 ''You should never have resigned,'' he told his mother, Anne Gorsuch Burford, by her later account. ''You didn't do anything wrong. You only did what the president ordered. Why are you quitting? You raised me not to be a quitter. Why are you a quitter?''\par \par \uc2 More than three decades later, Judge Gorsuch, a federal appeals court judge in Denver, has been nominated to the Supreme Court by President Trump and faces a political culture even more caustic than the one that destroyed his mother's public career. Like her, he is a committed conservative and can expect strong opposition, but where she was bold and brash, he has advanced to the pinnacle of the judiciary with understatement and polish.\par \par \uc2 Now 49, he arrives at his own moment of testing as a child of the Reagan revolution who saw up close the promise and the perils. He inherited a frontier skepticism of government rooted in his home of Colorado and nurtured in Washington during the 1980s. An examination of his early, formative years finds that he swam in the liberal waters of Columbia and Harvard and rebelled against the dominant thinking to develop a fully formed conservative philosophy that has propelled him to the threshold of the Supreme Court.\par \par \uc2 Those early years shaped his views on the law and life and provided a searing lesson in the realities of the political world. Despite the family ordeal, friends and relatives said, he emerged from the crucible of his youth tempered about politics yet not soured on public service. He decided to pursue goals similar to his mother's if only by a different path.\par \par \uc2 The first woman to lead the \uc2 Environmental Protection Agency\uc2 , Ms. Burford argued that states were better custodians of resources and that market forces would bring more discipline to regulation. As she cut spending and pared back rules, critics called her an enemy of the environment. Her downfall came when, at White House direction, she refused to turn over documents related to a toxic-waste program. Congress cited her for contempt.\par \par \uc2 ''It was an example to him of what the realpolitik of Washington could be like,'' said Richard M. Segal, a Harvard Law School classmate who is now a lawyer in San Diego. ''He viewed his mother as an environmentalist, and his mother viewed herself as an environmentalist. And meanwhile she was made the poster child of the view that the Reagan administration was just out there to rape the environment.''\par \par \uc2 The teenager was his mother's conscience. ''Neil knew from the beginning the seriousness of my problems,'' she wrote in a memoir before her death in 2004. He was ''smart as a whip'' and ''had an unerring sense of fairness, as do many people his age.'' When she resigned, ''he was really upset.''\par \par \uc2 By most accounts, he did not dwell on it later in life, but it clearly echoed in his work. In preparing a moot court brief at Harvard on workplace safety, he tried to add material concerning the E.P.A. that did not fit, recalled a classmate, Ellen M. Bublick, who is now a law professor at the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Arizona. In his time as an appeals court judge in Denver, his most notable writings have concerned the power of government regulators.\par \par \uc2 ''We talked about that prior history in relation to that,'' Professor Bublick said. ''He definitely was proud of his mom and had a sense that in the Reagan era certain people took a fall for him in order to protect him. And I think that was really his view of what happened to his mom.''\par \par \uc2 Rugged Individualism\par \par \uc2 Neil McGill Gorsuch's earliest years were spent in the West, where at Rocky Mountain campsites and fishing streams he internalized a faith in rugged individualism.\par \par \uc2 He grew up in a three-bedroom ranch-style house in the east Denver neighborhood of Hilltop. His parents, Anne and David Gorsuch, were lawyers who had three children: Neil in 1967, Stephanie in 1969 and J.J. in 1973. His mother raised them Catholic; his father was not religious. (Judge Gorsuch is now Episcopalian, according to his brother, possibly inspired by his time studying at \uc2 Oxford \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2 .)\par \par \uc2 Studious but not standoffish, Neil shared a bedroom with his brother and attended Christ the King, a Roman Catholic school. Relatives and friends recalled him lugging stacks of books and once rounding the baseball diamond in well-worn cowboy boots after leaving his athletic shoes at home. ''If anybody was going to be the president, it was going to be Neil Gorsuch,'' said Gina Carbone, 49, a classmate.\par \par \uc2 In 1976, Ms. Gorsuch was elected to the State Legislature, often aligning herself with a small but powerful group of conservatives, called the ''House Crazies,'' who were determined to cut taxes and loosen regulations. Women's groups supported her campaign, but in office she led a fight to kill the Colorado State Commission on Women. Fervently anti-abortion, she was, one politician told The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  in 1983, ''almost paranoid about any kind of abortion legislation.''\par \par \uc2 She rose quickly. ''She was very prominent in the shaping of policy,'' said Steve Durham, a leader of the House Crazies. She had a ''knack and ability to get along with people and put them at ease.'' But she was famously tough. The Rocky Mountain News wrote that she ''could kick a bear to death with her bare feet.''\par \par \uc2 After two terms, Ms. Gorsuch became one of three Coloradans to take prominent posts in the Reagan administration, along with James G. Watt, the interior secretary, and Robert Burford, the director of the Bureau of Land Management. Called the ''Colorado mafia,'' they managed the nation's natural resources with a fierce belief that the government had gone too far in regulating private enterprise. It was widely believed that they had the backing of Joseph \uc2 Coors\uc2 , the conservative Colorado beer magnate.\par \par \uc2 By the time Ms. Gorsuch moved to Washington in 1981, she was headed for a divorce, and the children toggled between the capital and Colorado. It was an adjustment for children used to the informal ways of the West.\par \par \uc2 ''All of a sudden we were across the country, having to dress up in coats and ties and having to act like grown-ups at prep school,'' said Michael Trent, a Californian whose father was deputy transportation secretary at the time and who found in Mr. Gorsuch a similar spirit.\par \par \uc2 The two boys took walks after dinner discussing the world. ''The two of us were huge fans of Reagan,'' said Mr. Trent, who was later best man at Judge Gorsuch's wedding and made the judge godfather to his children. ''And it was because of our family upbringings. It was so much a part of our lives at the time.''\par \par \uc2 Acting the Part\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gorsuch soon had a stepfather when his mother married Mr. Burford, whom she had met in the State Legislature.\par \par \uc2 Known for wearing furs and smoking two packs of cigarettes a day, Ms. Gorsuch became a prominent face of the new administration as she cut back lawsuits against polluters and tried to relax parts of the Clean Air Act.\par \par \uc2 ''There was obviously a lot of controversy regarding her work as she was carrying out the president's program,'' Ed Meese, a top Reagan adviser, recalled. ''I'm sure that undoubtedly had an impact on her son.''\par \par \uc2 J.J. Gorsuch, 43, now a vice president of a Denver marketing technology company, said his mother's political life had shaped the family psyche but ultimately made his brother stronger. ''If anything, it probably prepared him for the experience ahead in a great way,'' he said. ''He knows better than most how ugly the political process might get. So in that sense it's hopefully prepared him for the nomination process.''\par \par \uc2 His mother emerged from her 1983 resignation demoralized about Washington, which she called ''too small to be a state but too large to be an asylum for the mentally deranged.'' But if her tribulations scarred him, Judge Gorsuch gave little indication while at Georgetown Preparatory School, a well-heeled Jesuit school outside Washington.\par \par \uc2 His classmates -- many the children of politicians themselves -- knew the family connection, said Bill Hughes, son of a Democratic congressman, but left it unmentioned. As Mr. Trent said, ''I can't imagine what a difficult thing it would have been to go through that, but he never let it show.''\par \par \uc2 Judge Gorsuch focused on schoolwork and excelled at debate, competing nationally. ''Even as a kid, he would be able to step back from situations and be able to make judgments about them,'' said Stephen Ochs, a history teacher. ''He had the ability to be curious and look at both sides without being threatened.''\par \par \uc2 His conservative identity was already forming. The school yearbook jokingly listed him as founder of a ''Fascism Forever'' club, which an editorial note clarified ''happily jerked its knees against the increasingly 'left-wing' tendencies of the faculty.'' Mr. Trent called that ''sort of his little dig getting back'' at a teacher with whom he disagreed.\par \par \uc2 His views apparently cost him little among his peers, who elected him student president. Classmates speculated that his poise would lead to the law and perhaps politics, said one classmate, Brian Cashman, who is now general manager of the New York Yankees. ''He looked the part and acted the part.''\par \par \uc2 A Dissenting Voice\par \par \uc2 Judge Gorsuch arrived at Columbia in 1985 as the historically liberal \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2  was recovering from student protests the previous spring and beginning to divest from corporations operating in South Africa. In three years on campus -- he graduated a year early -- he emerged as the intellectual leader of a resurgent right. It was ''a happy band of dissenters,'' as Brian Domitrovic, a classmate and fellow conservative, put it.\par \par \uc2 His eloquence impressed many. That he was tall, clean cut and handsome only helped. He danced and drank Manhattans and martinis, Mr. Domitrovic said. He joined Phi Gamma Delta, a fraternity with a reputation for partying, and quietly attended religious services.\par \par \uc2 But principally, Judge Gorsuch became known as a fierce and lucid writer in the Columbia Daily Spectator, where he published columns, and later The Federalist Paper, which he helped found. Part newspaper, part opinion journal, The Federalist Paper drew comparisons to the conservative Dartmouth Review.\par \par \uc2 ''There was a two-party system at Columbia in the '80s: the liberals and the socialists,'' said Stephen Later, who worked on the paper. ''The Fed was a response to this echo chamber.''\par \par \uc2 Judge Gorsuch was out of step with campus zeitgeist. He bristled at attempts to bar military recruiting on campus, minimized the Iran-contra affair and dismissed a shantytown built on campus to protest South African apartheid. The main subject that animated his writing was the political hegemony he perceived at the \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2 . A ''tyrannical atmosphere of 'ideas,''' he called it in February 1987. ''There is little or no room at Columbia for dissenting voices: one is either Right or Wrong, Moral or Immoral, Compassionate or Heartless.''\par \par \uc2 In March 1987, as students debated the fraternity system's treatment of women and minorities, Judge Gorsuch co-wrote a piece defending all-male clubs. In a familiar rhetorical move, he reframed the issue as free speech. In their ''heavy handed moralism,'' he wrote, the system's critics missed ''the fact that Columbia is a pluralistic \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2 , that its fraternity is equally pluralistic, with options available for everyone.''\par \par \uc2 That spring, as students boycotted \uc2 Coors\uc2  beer, posters on campus alleged that The Federalist Paper, which accepted the company's advertising, had received funding from \uc2 the Heritage Foundation\uc2 , financed by the \uc2 Coors\uc2  family. Mr. Gorsuch mocked the ''professional protesters'' who had created the posters, and he threatened a libel suit.\par \par \uc2 ''He had a real regal way of writing about this stuff that made us look small,'' said Tom Kamber, a leader of the liberals. ''His role was really to write these screeds that would try to take the winds out of our sails.''\par \par \uc2 An Optimistic Time\par \par \uc2 The battle continued at Harvard Law School, where Judge Gorsuch arrived in 1988 along with a young man from Chicago named Barack Obama. The two did not intersect much -- Mr. Obama was six years older -- but they mirrored each other as intellectual leaders who managed to disagree without being disagreeable. ''Neil was not quite as public a person as Barack was, but at the same time, for the people who knew him, he was very well respected,'' said Mr. Segal, the classmate.\par \par \uc2 Young conservatives were inspired as the Soviet Union and its empire collapsed. ''It was an incredibly optimistic time, and it was a time when a lot of us developed a strong belief in the power of free markets and rule of law,'' said Ken Mehlman, another classmate who went on to become chairman of the Republican National Committee.\par \par \uc2 Harvard was the epicenter of a debate over whether the Constitution was a living document to be interpreted in evolving times or a neutral, unchanging charter judged by its original text. ''It was a pretty contentious time at Harvard Law School,'' said Adam H. Charnes, a classmate. ''There were conservatives who were provocateurs. He wasn't anything like that.''\par \par \uc2 Judge Gorsuch befriended liberals, including Norm Eisen, later a White House aide and ambassador under Mr. Obama. ''He stood out among the conservative group in not being loud,'' Mr. Eisen said. ''He managed to stay above that while making his conservative positions clear. I thought it was impressive.''\par \par \uc2 Through all of this, Judge Gorsuch made little mention of his famous mother. Indeed, one friend who stayed close after law school said he had realized the relationship only years later. Once when a fellow student said something disparaging about her on the assumption that he was not actually related, he brushed it off.\par \par \uc2 ''He deflected it in a very classy way that made me think it was not the first time somebody had said something like that,'' Mr. Eisen said.\par \par \uc2 Judge Gorsuch's mother did not live to see the day he was nominated to the Supreme Court. But for the family, his rise represents a vindication of sorts. If he survives confirmation, he will have conquered the capital that did her in.\par \par \uc2 Get politics and Washington news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and in the Morning Briefing newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Judge Neil M.

\par\par \uc2 HOW HE GOT THERE\par \uc2 Education Life Supplement; SECTED\par {\*\bkmkstart toc6}{\*\bkmkend toc6}\b \uc2 'If I Hadn't Gotten Fired From Salomon ...'\b0\par\par\uc2 By SAM ROBERTS \par \uc2 708 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 February 2017\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 9\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 He was the grandson of Russian and Lithuanian immigrants and the son of a dairy company accountant, and he was fired before he was 40. But \uc2 Michael R. Bloomberg\uc2  persevered to become, at last count by Forbes magazine, the world's eighth richest person. He achieved this phenomenal success without a master plan. But in retrospect, his evolution -- from Eagle Scout to graduate of Johns Hopkins and Harvard Business School, to bond trader and partner at Salomon Brothers, to founder of a business information network that bears his name and three-term mayor of New York City -- was no accident. Mr. Bloomberg, who briefly mulled an independent campaign for president last year, shared some advice for students looking to succeed in business.\par \par \uc2 Choosing a College\par \par \uc2 Nobody remembers where you went to school. The first job they may ask, by the third job they won't remember to. People put too much emphasis on that. It's much more important that you go to a place where you fit in and which has decent academics. People say they can't afford a college? My parents took out a mortgage, I had a job every summer working in a faculty parking lot. Then I got lucky, Sputnik was launched and the government created national defense loans.\par \par \uc2 Serendipitous Decisions\par \par \uc2 I think it's fair to say I had absolutely no idea what I would do. I went in thinking I wanted to study physics, but German was a requirement, so I changed to the engineering school. The whole idea of college is to expose yourself to various ideas and cultures and places, to minor in something different, to travel abroad.\par \par \uc2 Professional Curriculum\par \par \uc2 They're paying the STEM professor double what they're paying the liberal arts professor, because the marketplace says there's much more demand for those careers. I remember coming to New York in 1966 after \uc2 Harvard Business School\uc2  and I took philosophy and art appreciation at the New School. I did not have a good liberal arts education in high school or in college, but did it change my life? I don't know.\par \par \uc2 An M.B.A. Matters, but . . .\par \par \uc2 The part that's most important in an education is how to deal with people. There's no job I know that you do by yourself, and I learned as much from the two guys I worked for at Salomon Brothers, Billy Salomon and John Gutfreund, as I'd learned at Harvard. In the end, it's people skills that you need. Whether you remember that Columbus arrived in 1492 or not -- a lot of the facts you memorize are immaterial.\par \par \uc2 Turning Adversity Into Advantage\par \par \uc2 At Salomon, I was ''demoted'' as head of equity trading and sales to head the emerging computer systems area. If I hadn't gotten fired from Salomon, which became part of \uc2 Citigroup\uc2 , I wouldn't have gotten a $10 million severance, used my electrical engineering degree to begin my own information technology company and program a computer terminal for bond traders. I'd be working for my girlfriend now, who's on the board of Citibank!\par \par \uc2 Who Gets the Job\par \par \uc2 What disturbs me is you talk to kids applying today and they invariably say, ''I cured cancer, I brought peace to the Mideast.'' Spare me. How about, ''My father never existed, my mother is a convicted drug dealer. I worked three shifts at \uc2 McDonald's\uc2 .'' That's the kind of kid I want -- with an ethic of taking care of his family -- because then he'll take care of others. Some of us don't have much prenatal intelligence, but nevertheless go out and try and have a decent chance of surviving. I'm not the smartest guy in the room, but nobody's going to outwork me.\par \par \uc2 Also, kids today brag about having had four or five jobs in the first few years. What a lot of people don't do is give it the old college try and stick with it.\par \par \uc2 What I Would Have Done Differently\par \par \uc2 Given the way things turned out, nothing.\par \par \uc2 Interview has been condensed and lightly edited.\par \par \uc2 (PHOTOGRAPH BY JOHNS HOPKINS \b \highlight22\uc2 UNIVERSITY\b0 \highlight\uc2 ) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020170205ed250005h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

And he had no shortage of opinions.\par \par \uc2 His topics ranged broadly, from life on campus to the Iran-contra affair. His conservatism was a constant. And he had a lively writing style that persists to this day.\par \par \uc2 He and his collaborators seemed to sense that their writings would survive the years. ''We ought not forget,'' they wrote in an unsigned 1987 editorial for The Federalist Paper, which Judge Gorsuch helped start, ''there is something vital and useful in the curious, if imperfect youth -- something that shall not be stifled.''\par \par \uc2 Here is a selection of that youthful curiosity.\par \par \uc2 'Free speech works'\par \par \uc2 While mounting an ultimately unsuccessful bid for a seat on the \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2  Senate as a freshman in 1986, Judge Gorsuch was asked by The Columbia Daily Spectator for his views on hot-button issues, including the question of whether the Marines should be allowed to recruit on campus.\par \par \uc2 ''The question here is not whether 'the Marines should be allowed to recruit on campus' but whether a \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  and its community, so devoted to the freedom of individuals to pursue their own chosen lifestyles and to speak freely, has the right or obligation to determine who may speak on campus or what may be said. To fulfill an immediate end, we are likely to forget the underlying principle that every human being, according to our nation's proclamations, and reinforced by our \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2 's standards, has an inalienable right to express himself or herself -- whether we agree or not. Free speech works; it works better than any form of censorship or suppression; and in exercising vigorously, the truth is bound to emerge.''\par \par \uc2 'The mire of indecision'\par \par \uc2 The Spectator commissioned a series of columns on the lessons that should be learned from the Iran-contra affair. Judge Gorsuch, whose mother had served in the Reagan administration, saw a need for a more decisive American foreign policy.\par \par \uc2 ''We need to clarify our policy-making, act with confidence, and decide: will we truly support the liberation of Nicaragua or will we try the 'hands-off' approach? To futilely condemn more Contras to death, as we did the Cuban freedom fighters at the Bay of Pigs and our own countrymen in Vietnam, to continue in ambivalent, contradictory policy-making, is no longer an acceptable alternative. It is time to step out of the mire of indecision that has frustrated American foreign policy over the last 20 years and that continues today.''\par \par \uc2 'Tyrannical atmosphere of ''ideas'''\par \par \uc2 In a February 1987 column, he took the \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2  to task for what he called its failure to promote diversity (''that cherished buzzword'') of thought.\par \par \uc2 ''But on at least one significant count, Columbia falls considerably short. Amazingly, radically different people from radically different backgrounds and locales share an incredible hegemony here on Morningside Heights in their radical politics.''\par \par \uc2 ''Truth is: Columbia does have a moral responsibility. It has a moral responsibility to overcome the tyrannical atmosphere of 'ideas' that has so dominated life on Morningside for the last 20 years; it has a responsibility to make the political, philosophical, and ethical experience here as diverse and varied as the cultural and ethnic experience.''\par \par \uc2 'Heavy-handed moralism'\par \par \uc2 In March 1987, Judge Gorsuch argued against making Columbia's fraternity system coed as the \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2  more fully integrated women. Writing with his friend Michael Behringer in The Federalist Paper, Judge Gorsuch, a member of Phi Gamma Delta, once more cited freedom of association.\par \par \uc2 ''Drawing analogies to slavery and segregation, supporters of the coed rule say that Columbia has a moral obligation to recognize that changing our Greek system is a matter of equal rights.''\par \par \uc2 ''What such heavy-handed moralism misses is the fact that Columbia is a pluralistic \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2 , that its fraternity system is equally pluralistic, with options available for everyone. There is no one at Columbia who cannot join a fraternity or initiate a new one if they wish to do so.''\par \par \uc2 'Asking for special treatment'\par \par \uc2 In 1988, Columbia was embroiled in debates about its fraternities, new \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2  rules governing protests, and a student council election. Judge Gorsuch, never a fan of student protesters, derided ''progressives'' in a Spectator op-ed column as being anything but progressive as they claimed ''a monopoly on righteousness.''\par \par \uc2 ''With their 'issues,' campus 'progressives' have tried to convince us that we have an obligation to act. They insist that they are being harassed by 'terroristic fascist.' But what they forget to tell us is that they are asking for special treatment, acting as a vigilante squad while avoiding the weight of their own actions.''\par \par \uc2 Get politics and Washington news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and in the Morning Briefing newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Neil Gorsuch in 1988. \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020170205ed250005g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Writing in 1965, the distinguished British historian Hugh Trevor-Roper argued against the idea that black people in Africa had their own history: ''There is only the history of the Europeans in Africa,'' he declared. ''The rest is largely darkness.'' History, he continued, ''is essentially a form of movement, and purposive movement too,'' which in his view Africans lacked.\par \par \uc2 Trevor-Roper was echoing an idea that goes back at least to the early 19th century. But it wasn't always this way. When the young Prince Cosimo de Medici (1590-1621) was being tutored to become the Duke of Tuscany -- about the time that Shakespeare was writing ''Hamlet'' -- he was asked to memorize a ''summary of world leaders'' that included \u193\'00\'C1lvaro II, the King of Kongo, along with the Mutapa Empire and the mythical ''Prester John'' of Ethiopia. Soon, however, even that level of knowledge about African history would be rare.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps it shouldn't surprise us that ideas about Africans and their supposed lack of history and culture were used to justify the enslavement of millions of Africans throughout the New World, especially during the 19th century when sugar production was reaching a zenith in Cuba and cotton was making growers and manufacturers rich. What is surprising is that these ideas persisted well into the 20th century, among white and black Americans alike.\par \par \uc2 When I was growing up in the 1950s, Africa was the shadow that both framed and stalked the existence of every African-American. For some of us, such as Paul Cuffee and Marcus Garvey, it was a place to venerate, a place to escape the horrors of slavery and Jim Crow. For so many others of us, however, it was a place to run away from. After all, scholars such as the sociologist E. Franklin Frazier insisted that the horrors of bondage and the trans-Atlantic crossing had severed any meaningful cultural or religious links between black folks on either side of the ocean, when in fact enslaved Africans brought with them their religious beliefs, music and ways of seeing the world.\par \par \uc2 When I was a child, one of few insults between black people more devastating than the ''n-word'' was to be called ''a black African.'' Far too many of us had been brainwashed into believing that the darkness of the skin of the stereotypical African on stage and screen reflected the darkness of the cultural and intellectual soul of an entire continent of people, the continent of our ancestors.\par \par \uc2 Almost all African-Americans descend from black people who managed, somehow, to survive the Middle Passage and the soul-crushing ordeal of slavery, America's ''peculiar institution,'' as it was called in the 19th century. My oldest ancestor in the Gates line is a woman named Jane Gates, who was born in 1819. She was a shadow, too. I first saw her portrait in 1960, when I was 10 years old. Unlike her mixed-race descendants, she looked ''African,'' we thought, so that's how we referred to her: Jane Gates, the African.\par \par \uc2 I used to wonder where she had come from, and who her people were; what language her mother spoke; what was her mother tongue. Later I would learn that Jane couldn't have been born in Africa, since the slave trade to America ended in 1808. But her grandparents could have been Africans, and quite probably left the continent from the Gambia River or just north of Congo, ''almost certainly on a British ship,'' the historian of the slave trade David Eltis tells me. Only DNA can tell me more. Her tightly wound hair and those high cheekbones and that glassy stare were all of Africa that had been left behind for her great-great-grandchildren to ponder. Where were your people born, Jane Gates, the African? Could we ever bring your people's culture and history out of the shadows?\par \par \uc2 It was hard enough in the 1950s to wrap one's head around the slave experience, outside of shaping signifiers such as ''Gone With the Wind'' and \uc2 Disney\uc2 's ''Song of the South.'' But Africa and its Africans? Who could imagine more about Africa than ''Tarzan'' and ''Ramar of the Jungle''? Except for the relatively few African-Americans who saw through such racist fictions of Africa, drawn upon to devalue their humanity and justify their relegation to second-class citizenship -- people such as Garvey, Henry Highland Garnet, Martin R. Delany, W.E.B. Du Bois (who would die a citizen of Ghana), Langston Hughes and Maya Angelou -- far too many of us felt that ''Africa'' was something of an embarrassment. Richard Wright, the great novelist, published a book titled ''Black Power'' in 1954 about feeling that way.\par \par \uc2 That began to change for me sometime around 1960, the year that 17 European colonies became independent African countries, following Sudan in 1956 and Ghana in 1957. I was in the fifth grade by the time these countries were born, with arresting names such as Togo, Madagascar and Somalia, and more familiar ones such as Senegal, Nigeria, Gabon and the Congo. Our geography teacher, Mr. McHenry (our only male teacher), hung a map of the world listing recent events in front of the blackboard every Monday. Our task was to master the details of nine or 10 newsworthy events. Africa was all over this map.\par \par \uc2 That's how my love affair with Africa began. I memorized the names of the new countries and the names of their leaders -- Patrice Lumumba and Mo\u239\'00\'EFse Tshombe, L\u233\'00\'E9opold Senghor and Kwame Nkrumah -- and exotic-sounding city names: Dar es Salaam and Mogadishu, Dakar and Kinshasa. Then we read an incredible story, perhaps from \uc2 Reader's Digest\uc2 , about a boy who walked across the Equator. I wanted to cross the Equator, too.\par \par \uc2 So many of the students of my generation at Yale were introduced to African art and culture through a wildly popular course taught by the eminent art historian Robert Farris Thompson. Studying these things within the womb of the black cultural nationalism of the late '60s and early '70s made the appeal -- the lure -- of Africa irresistible, as Du Bois might say. So, when opportunity knocked, I answered the door.\par \par \uc2 The door that opened Africa to me was an exceptionally imaginative gap-year program at Yale. Funded by the \uc2 Mellon Foundation\uc2 , it sent 12 students to work (not study) in a developing country between sophomore and junior years. I ended up working in an Anglican mission hospital in a village called Kilimatinde, in the middle of Tanzania, about 340 miles from Dar es Salaam, with a population of about 6,000 today -- far smaller than when I arrived there in August 1970. Several months later, I would hitchhike across the Equator with a recent Harvard graduate named Lawrence Biddle Weeks, ending up in Kinshasa before flying to Lagos, then on to Accra, to visit Du Bois's grave. Two years later, I would find myself in the Cambridge \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  classroom of the great Nigerian playwright Wole Soyinka, slowly but inevitably falling in love with the idea that I might become a professor of African studies.\par \par \uc2 African history is replete with riveting stories that refute centuries of stereotypes about black people and that show our shared humanity: Our common ancestor, Mitochondrial Eve, 200,000 years ago; the out-migration of our anatomically modern Homo sapien great-grandparents 50,000 to 80,000 years ago; the still-magical Nile River kingdom of Egypt and its rival Kush around 3,000 B.C.; and Emperor Menelik II's heroic stand on the plains of Adwa on March 1, 1896, when, blessed by a replica of the ark of the covenant, he soundly defeated an Italian army.\par \par \uc2 African history is an encounter with ''kings and queens and bishops, too,'' as the song says, including a black queen of Meroe who defeated the Romans in 24 B.C., then confiscated and buried a statue of Augustus Caesar before her throne so that her subjects could gleefully walk on his head. The third nation in the world to convert to Christianity was Ethiopia, in A.D. 350. How many of us know that the Sahara was a trading highway or that the ruler of Great Zimbabwe, in the late Middle Ages, dined off porcelain plates made in China?\par \par \uc2 Africa -- contrary to myths of isolation and stagnation -- has been embedded in the world and the world embedded in Africa. There was nothing empty or blank about it except the willful forgetting by the Western world, after the onset of the slave trade, of Africa's long and fascinating history.\par \par \uc2 Though not very likely, I like to think that Jane Gates's grandmother would have passed down even one of these many riveting stories, and eventually it would have been passed down to me. Our challenge today is to ensure that more and more stories like these become a central part of the school curriculum, as well as the stuff of documentaries and the mythologies of Hollywood, so that they will never be lost again.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Henry Louis Gates Jr. is the host of the PBS series ''Africa's Great Civilizations'' and director of Harvard's Hutchins Center for African and African American Research.\par \par \uc2 Ageneration of African leaders who inspired an American schoolboy: from left, Patrice Lumumba and Mo\u239\'00\'EFse Tshombe of the Congo; L\u233\'00\'E9opold Senghor of Senegal; and Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Q. A hundred years before the Women's March on Washington, another women's uprising took place, in which Marie Ganz, known as Sweet Marie, played a leading role. Who was she and where did she get her nickname?\par \par \uc2 A. Newspapers of the day said Ms. Ganz, who was arrested in the food riots of 1917, was incendiary and cursed like a sailor. So naturally, cynical reporters called her ''Sweet Marie,'' according to Thai Jones, the curator for American history in the Rare Book and Manuscript Library at \uc2 Columbia \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2 . In 1925, however, another reporter said that she had received the name ''because of an intriguing smile and an engaging personality.''\par \par \uc2 In 1914, Sweet Marie carried a pistol into the Standard Oil Building in New York and threatened to shoot John D. Rockefeller Jr. Fortunately, Mr. Rockefeller, whom Sweet Marie blamed for brutalizing striking miners in Colorado, was not in.\par \par \uc2 ''She spent 60 days in jail for it, and it was the main thing on her political r\u233\'00\'E9sum\u233\'00\'E9, if you can call it that,'' Dr. Jones said, adding, ''She was kind of a street-corner speaker and definitely a rabble-rouser.''\par \par \uc2 The food riots began on the morning of Feb. 19, 1917, when women who had gone to the food market area in Brownsville, Brooklyn, found that prices, which had already been rising, had gone up again.\par \par \uc2 The trouble began at 10 a.m., ''when a woman who didn't have enough cash to cover her purchases overturned a pushcart,'' William Freiburger wrote on a CUNY web page about the episode.\par \par \uc2 ''As the peddler protested and attempted to chase after her,'' he continued, ''hundreds of women surged in upon the hapless businessman.''\par \par \uc2 The police contended with a thousand rioters for two hours before order was restored, Mr. Freiburger wrote.\par \par \uc2 The next morning, The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  said, 400 mothers, many carrying babies, stormed City Hall to demand cheaper food. An official met with Sweet Marie and other protest leaders, promising a meeting with the mayor. The crowd began to disperse. Then Sweet Marie ''harangued the crowd in bitter language, and soon everything was confusion.'' She was taken into custody.\par \par \uc2 Outbreaks of violence continued into March, Mr. Freiburger wrote, and protests spread to Philadelphia and Boston.\par \par \uc2 In March, Eric Ferrar wrote on the Lo-Down website, the city helped to defuse the crisis by ''securing thousands of pounds of low-cost produce,'' which allowed wholesalers to lower prices.\par \par \uc2 Marie Ganz was born in 1891 in Eastern Europe and came to America as a child, according to ''Anarchist Women'' by Margaret S. Marsh. Her father died in 1899, and she was working full time by age 13.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Marsh noted that both the anarchist Emma Goldman and The Times's editorial board, ''who agree on nothing else, characterized Ms. Ganz as a reckless and irresponsible young woman who attempted to incite others to violence and cared little for the consequences.''\par \par \uc2 A Feb. 24, 1925, article titled ''Motherhood Has Changed 'Sweet Marie''' said that Ms. Ganz, ''now Mrs. Nat Ferber,'' no longer believed in violence. ''I was concerned almost entirely about the poor and the problems with which they had to contend,'' she said, adding: ''More than anything else, perhaps, it is an empty stomach that makes a real radical. This is a fact that should compel vital attention of all parties even today.''\par \par \uc2 Email fyi@nytimes.com\par \par \uc2 Hundreds of women stormed City Hall in New York in 1917 to demand cheaper food prices.

Then Spits It at You.\b0\par\par\uc2 By JOSHUA BARONE \par \uc2 1,422 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 February 2017\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 20\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Bridget Everett's cabaret show is known to have a splash zone. The 44-year-old queen of no-holds-barred music and comedy often bites the cork out of a bottle of chardonnay and spits it at the audience before indulging and then liberally spraying the crowd. (She is also known to end each performance by sitting on an audience member's face.) So it came as no surprise that, as I joined her on a recent shopping trip, the first thing she said was, ''I start right at California Chardonnays -- shall we go?''\par \par \uc2 We were at Astor Wine & Spirits, a few doors from Joe's Pub, Ms. Everett's de facto home base for New York shows and where she returns on Feb. 7 and 8 for her signature performance, a mix of brash storytelling and power ballads with her band, the Tender Moments. After decades of grinding it out in the downtown scene while working in restaurants, Ms. Everett is embarking on what promises to be her biggest year yet.\par \par \uc2 When we met, she was on a break between concerts and the Sundance Film Festival, where she was featured in two new movies: ''Patti Cake$,'' in which she plays the mother of an unlikely aspiring rapper, and ''Fun Mom Dinner,'' where she joins Molly Shannon, Toni Collette and Katie Aselton for wine-soaked high jinks. (Both have been picked up by distributors.)\par \par \uc2 ''I waited tables for 25 years,'' Ms. Everett said while surveying the store's options, noticing that her favorite label, Rombauer, was the store's staff pick. ''They used to call me the Wine Whisperer.''\par \par \uc2 ''I like my wine like I like me,'' she added. ''Big and bold.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Everett has a voice powerful enough to fill an arena (which she has done). It pairs well with her outsize persona onstage, where she welcomes accidental nudity and forces audience members to lick whipped cream off her body, join in lewd singalongs, or ''motorboat'' her, by placing their face between her breasts. The titles of her songs -- and the names of her dresses -- are largely unprintable. Her \uc2 Comedy Central\uc2  special was ''Gynecological Wonder.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Everett's outlandish, unapologetic aesthetic has made her a favorite of other boundary-pushing performers like Amy Schumer, who featured her in the film ''Trainwreck'' and aired a Joe's Pub performance to close the first season finale of ''Inside Amy Schumer.''\par \par \uc2 ''It's just really satisfying,'' Ms. Schumer said of Ms. Everett's budding fame. ''She's my absolutely, bar none, favorite performer to see live. She's such a star. There's no other word.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Everett is still getting used to praise like this, which pours from the mouths of celebrities including Patti LuPone and Sarah Jessica Parker. ''Every once in a while, I'm like, 'What world am I living in?''' she said, and admitted she is prone to being starstruck. At Sundance, she jokingly flirted with the actor Gael Garc\u237\'00\'EDa Bernal. ''I still can't breathe,'' Ms. Everett wrote in an email after the festival. ''He glows.''\par \par \uc2 Singing has always been a part of Ms. Everett's life. As the daughter of a music teacher in Manhattan, Kan., she was steered to voice lessons (and away from computer classes), she recalled in a post-shopping interview at the apartment of her longtime costume designer, Larry Krone.\par \par \uc2 The lessons paid off: She received a full choral scholarship to \uc2 Arizona State \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2 , then stayed in Arizona, where she was a karaoke maven and worked at the first P. F. Chang's. She waited on athletes including Charles Barkley and Mark McGwire and made connections that brought her opportunities like singing the national anthem at baseball games -- with no flourishes, she emphasized. ''I'm a big believer that if you're not Whitney Houston, you sing the notes on the page,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 In the mid-1990s, Ms. Everett said, she realized she didn't want to spend her life as a karaoke singer, and packed up for New York. She hasn't been back to Arizona since.\par \par \uc2 Work didn't come easily. Ms. Everett starred as the mother in a children's theater production of ''Hansel and Gretel,'' and casting calls fell flat. She worked at places like the Ellen's Stardust Diner, famous for its singing waitstaff, and in off-hours built a small following as a karaoke singer with dramatic, bold renditions of go-tos like ''You Oughta Know'' and ''Piece of My Heart.''\par \par \uc2 A turning point came when a friend introduced her to the world of downtown performance. He took her to see the cabaret duo Kiki and Herb, and Ms. Everett became close with Murray Hill, the borscht belt-style comedian and host. Through karaoke and this network of performers, she landed gigs at Ars Nova and LaMaMa -- and, of course, Joe's Pub.\par \par \uc2 Over the past decade, Ms. Everett has developed the onstage persona that is familiar and beloved among her fans. Her bawdy comedy, paired with original songs -- which, while hilarious and heartbreaking, run the gamut of emotions -- now make for a surprisingly cathartic experience.\par \par \uc2 ''It's a kind of shock theater,'' Ms. LuPone said. ''You're exposing yourself, and it's a release. It's a revival. Those evangelical preachers have nothing on Bridget.''\par \par \uc2 Murray Hill compared Ms. Everett to ''Rocky.'' ''Her shows are a prizefight,'' he said. ''She's fighting against what she is supposed to be -- the norm, the box that women are put in. She comes out swinging. We root for her all night.''\par \par \uc2 Catharsis, Ms. Everett said, is at least what she was trying to experience for herself. ''I think in my personal life I wasn't finding much happiness,'' she said. When she performed at Joe's Pub only once a month in between restaurant shifts, she added, ''these shows were the only chance to feel these emotions.''\par \par \uc2 But her career progressed with a slow, steady burn. In 2013, she received a New York Voices grant from Joe's Pub, which led to her 2014 show ''Rock Bottom,'' written with Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman, of ''Hairspray'' fame. Both songwriters said they did little more than polish the songs Ms. Everett had written. ''She has great ear for hooks, and she's a beautiful lyricist,'' Mr. Shaiman said. Mr. Wittman added: ''There was a lot under the motorboating and bikinis that she was willing to share. We just tried to bring more of that out.''\par \par \uc2 Writing the show's stunning finale, ''I'll Take You Home,'' for example, started with a melody line and lyrics by Ms. Everett. The final result, which was fleshed out with Mr. Shaiman and Mr. Wittman, is a dynamic progression from a quiet, delicate beginning to a rousing, belted ending that often inspires standing ovations.\par \par \uc2 ''Rock Bottom'' was the final push for quitting what Ms. Everett likes to call her ''slave job'' at the restaurant, which she kept for health insurance. When the manager emailed to ask when she was coming back, Ms. Everett sent a triumphant reply: ''I'm not coming back.'' Then she went to a performance of ''Rock Bottom.''\par \par \uc2 ''I told everybody, and I was crying, and they were crying,'' she said. ''The audience has been with me through everything. It was pretty emotional.''\par \par \uc2 ''Rock Bottom'' ended up selling out, and it occasionally returns to Joe's Pub for brief runs. One of its newest regulars is Poppy, the dog she adopted in 2015 and a social media celebrity in her own right.\par \par \uc2 ''Since I got her,'' Ms. Everett said, ''it's like my songwriting has changed. My life has changed.'' She added that, since she has no training as an actor, she thought of Poppy while filming a sad scene in a movie recently. It worked; there were tears.\par \par \uc2 In fact, the bottle of Rombauer Ms. Everett bought at the wine store was for Poppy's sitter. After all, she doesn't buy only one bottle at a time. ''When I was waiting tables, it was whatever they had for $10 to $15 from Napa,'' Ms. Everett said while perusing labels. ''But now I'll order a case of Rombauer. I've worked hard. I deserve it.''\par \par \uc2 Top, Bridget Everett and her dog, Poppy, at Astor Wine & Spirits. Above, Ms. Everett in her show ''Rock Bottom'' in 2014.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Senator Bernie Sanders may not have succeeded in his effort to become president, but his campaign to place the cost of college higher up on the national agenda seems to be gaining momentum. In January, he was by \uc2 Andrew Cuomo\uc2 's side when the governor proposed that New Yorkers with family income under $125,000 be able to attend state colleges tuition-free. Then Rhode Island announced its own proposal, covering two years but open to all in-state students no matter their income. At the federal level, with a Republican-controlled Congress, prospects for similar legislation are dim. During her confirmation hearing as education secretary, Betsy DeVos told Mr. Sanders: ''There's nothing in life that's truly free. Somebody's going to pay for it.'' Still, the senator from Vermont continues to visit campuses and to push for federal legislation that would make tuition at public colleges free for all.\par \par \uc2 One of President Trump's few statements about higher education finance reflected his desire to bring tuition prices down by cutting what he called administrative bloat and tapping endowments. Do you agree with that approach?\par \par \uc2 We do have to do our best to make sure that colleges and universities are cost-effective and that endowments are not used to build 50,000- or 100,000-person football stadiums or for spending a fortune on four-star suites. Very often, however, many of the costs associated with colleges don't have a lot to do with education per se, whether it's health care for faculty or energy costs. And those are national problems that we have to address.\par \par \uc2 So should they have to spend more of their endowments and should we restrict how they do spend them?\par \par \uc2 I will certainly look at any legislation that comes up, and if it makes sense to me, I'm happy to support it.\par \par \uc2 But my focus right now is to make public colleges and universities tuition-free. I was pleased to see Governor Cuomo carrying the banner. I will be supporting any governor who wants to do this.\par \par \uc2 Right now and for well over 100 years, we've talked about public education in America as being K-12. So we have to change the definition of what free public education means in a changing economy. We used to be No. 1 in the world, in terms of the percentage of people who graduated from college and universities. Today, we are No. 11 among people 35 and under.\par \par \uc2 Do you worry that a focus on covering the tuition costs for students at public schools implicitly encourages those universities to keep raising prices, in effect giving them cover to do so?\par \par \uc2 I don't think so. What you've seen in recent years is significant underfunding. But I think it's incumbent on those state legislatures and governors to make sure they are run cost-effectively and hire people who are capable of doing that.\par \par \uc2 President Trump has suggested federal student loan forgiveness for all borrowers after 15 years of payment, instead of the 20 years that is standard in many instances now. Is that something you can get behind?\par \par \uc2 It's a start, though I can't give you a definitive answer. What I proposed during the campaign was to immediately allow all people to refinance loans at the lowest interest rate they can find. That would be an incredible first step.\par \par \uc2 So a family from Burlington, Vt., stops you on the street and asks how to figure out whether private colleges like Middlebury or Champlain are $40,000 a year better than the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Vermont\uc2 . What would you have them look at, and should the government demand that schools produce more data on actual value?\par \par \uc2 We need to have as much information as we can about how a school performs, but ''value'' is a hard word to define. They can say, as they do at Champlain, that 88 percent of graduates are employed in jobs related to their goals, and that's important to know. On the other hand, I have a good friend who teaches poetry at the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Vermont\uc2 . There's probably not a great market for poets. But is that to say it's not important? You can't just look at things from a corporate perspective. Teaching poetry is important.\par \par \uc2 This interview has been condensed and lightly edited.\par \par \uc2 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.\par \par \uc2 (PHOTOGRAPH BY MARY ALTAFFER/ASSOCIATED PRESS) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020170205ed250004x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

TREASTER \par \uc2 2,264 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 February 2017\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 At Georgia State's nursing school, the faculty used to believe that students who got a poor grade in ''Conceptual Foundations of Nursing'' probably wouldn't go on to graduation. So they were surprised, after an analysis of student records stretching back a decade, to discover what really made a difference for nursing students: their performance in introductory math.\par \par \uc2 ''You could get a C or an A in that first nursing class and still be successful,'' said Timothy M. Renick, the vice provost. ''But if you got a low grade in your math courses, by the time you were in your junior and senior years, you were doing very poorly.''\par \par \uc2 The analysis showed that fewer than 10 percent of nursing students with a C in math graduated, compared with about 80 percent of students with at least a B+. Algebra and statistics, it seems, were providing an essential foundation for later classes in biology, microbiology, physiology and pharmacology.\par \par \uc2 Georgia State is one of a growing number of colleges and universities using what is known as predictive analytics to spot students in danger of dropping out. Crunching hundreds of thousands and sometimes millions of student academic and personal records, past and present, they are coming up with courses that signal a need for intervention.\par \par \uc2 A little less than half of the nation's students graduate in four years; given two more years to get the job done, the percentage rises to only about 60 percent. That's no small concern for families shouldering the additional tuition or student debt (an average of more than $28,000 on graduation, according to a 2016 College Board report). Students who drop out are in even worse shape. Such outcomes have led parents and politicians to demand colleges do better. Big data is one experiment in how to do that.\par \par \uc2 Health care companies and sports teams have been working with predictive analytics for years. But the approach is in its early stages on campuses. A handful of companies have sprung up in the last few years, working with perhaps 200 universities. They identify trends in the data and create computer programs that monitor student progress and alert advisers when students go off historically successful pathways.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Renick uses Amazon to suggest how predictive analytics work. ''When Amazon looks at all your choices of books and makes predictions that you'll like other books, it doesn't need to know why you'll like the third book,'' he said. ''Our big data doesn't need to know exactly why a student gets a bad grade. It just happens thousands and thousands of times. We're looking at a pattern.''\par \par \uc2 Different courses at different universities have proved to be predictors of success, or failure. The most significant seem to be foundational courses that prepare students for higher-level work in a particular major. Across a dozen of its clients, the data analysts \uc2 Civitas Learning\uc2  found that the probability of graduating dropped precipitously if students got less than an A or a B in a foundational course in their major, like management for a business major or elementary education for an education major. El Paso Community College's nursing hot spot was a foundational biology course. Anyone who got an A had a 71 percent chance of graduating in six years; those with a B had only a 53 percent chance.\par \par \uc2 At the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Arizona\uc2 , a high grade in English comp proved to be crucial to graduation. Only 41 percent of students who got a C in freshman writing ended up with a degree, compared with 61 percent of the B students and 72 percent of A students.\par \par \uc2 ''We always figured that if a student got a C, she was fine,'' said Melissa Vito, a senior vice provost. ''It turns out, a C in a foundation course like freshman composition can be an indicator that the student is not going to succeed.'' The \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2  now knows it needs to throw more resources at writing, specifically at those C students.\par \par \uc2 At \uc2 Middle Tennessee State \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2 , History 2020, an American history course required for most students, has been a powerful predictor. The most consistent feature for those who did not graduate was that they received a D in it. ''History is a heavy reading course,'' said Richard D. Sluder, vice provost for student success, ''so it signifies a need for reading comprehension.''\par \par \uc2 Before predictive analytics, Dr. Sluder said, many of the D's went unnoticed. That's because advisers were mainly monitoring grade-point averages, not grades in specific courses. ''You take a student who's getting A's and B's and you see a C in this one class,'' he said, ''and you'd say, 'He looks fine.' But, really, he was at risk.''\par \par \uc2 Such insight may revolutionize the way student advising works.\par \par \uc2 Among the historic data that the education tech companies analyze are SAT and ACT scores; personal and demographic information; courses that students are taking and grades they are getting; and behaviors like how frequently they are seeing advisers and tutors and how actively they are engaging in the campus networks where professors post homework assignments, lecture notes, comments and grades.\par \par \uc2 The analytics programs know the paths that successful students have followed. When a student veers off that path, like getting a low grade in a predictor course or taking a course out of sequence, advisers get an alert, a signal to reach out to the student and offer suggestions.\par \par \uc2 One perennial problem is that students register for the wrong classes. ''Students think they're signing up for a particular lab for chem majors,'' Dr. Renick said, ''but it turns out to be for nonmajors. In the past we might not learn about that until the student was already in the class or even after he had finished the course. Now we're getting an alert and we get the student into the right class. We had 2,000 students like this last year.''\par \par \uc2 The advisers are linked so that their notes and meetings with students are available for colleagues, just as doctors in hospital systems share notes on patients.\par \par \uc2 Most universities have not been using big data long enough to see improvement in four- or six-year graduation rates. But some evidence indicates a positive impact. The schools that have seen some success have combined analytics with significant investment in other initiatives. Georgia State has more than doubled its advising staff, to about 100, and now meets the national standard of one adviser for 300 students. ''It's a heavy load,'' Dr. Renick said, ''but in the past we had 750 to one.'' In 2016, Georgia State's four-year graduation rate rose 5 percentage points, to 27 percent, and the six-year rate rose 6 points, to 54 percent.\par \par \uc2 Georgia State is sharing technology with 10 other universities in a coalition called the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  Innovation Alliance. The alliance has pledged to graduate an additional 68,000 students in the next eight years.\par \par \uc2 Middle Tennessee State, which like Georgia State has many low-income, minority students, began working with the big data company EAB in fall 2014. Since then, it has more than doubled its advising staff, to 78, expanded free tutoring to 200 subjects from about 20, redesigned 27 foundation courses and started monitoring student progress weekly.\par \par \uc2 ''All of this is important,'' said Dr. Sluder. ''But the technology is crucial. Take out all the technology and you just don't get that end result.'' Freshman retention at Middle Tennessee has risen 5 percentage points, to 76 percent, in just two years.\par \par \uc2 A few universities are developing their own programs. In September, students at Stanford began using a digital tool based on 15 years of data that helps them in the daunting task of choosing from among some 5,000 undergraduate classes.\par \par \uc2 ''No single adviser, however wise and alert, can possibly be aware of all the instructional opportunities,'' said Mitchell L. Stevens, an associate professor of education who led in the development of the program.\par \par \uc2 Freshmen at the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Michigan\uc2  began using a tool in the fall that mixes their personal and academic data with data on how earlier students did, advice from them and study guides from professors. After students complete a survey about their expectations for success in a course, the program digs into the data to see if those expectations are realistic. When they sign on, it takes them through questions and answers in what feels like a conversation.\par \par \uc2 ''Hello, Kate. You told us that the grade you want to receive is a B. This is a good goal for you. You should be more confident that you can achieve this! What if you aim for an even higher grade?''\par \par \uc2 Tim McKay, the professor of physics, astronomy and education who created the application, called ECoach, said thousands of students who regularly used the application over six years of testing often earned a third of a letter grade higher -- from a B- to a B, for instance -- than those who did not use it.\par \par \uc2 At the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Arizona\uc2 , Sudha Ram, the director of Insite: Center for Business Intelligence and Analytics, has been experimenting with tracking freshmen -- the category of students most likely to drop out -- as they swipe their identification cards to go to the library or gym, pay for a meal in the cafeteria or buy a sweatshirt in the bookstore.\par \par \uc2 ''We are measuring social interaction,'' Dr. Ram said. ''How many people do they tend to hang out with for different activities, and is their hanging out dropping off week by week or getting stronger? A lot of theoretical work has been done on this.''\par \par \uc2 The findings are put into algorithms to predict who is in danger of not making it to sophomore year.\par \par \uc2 ''Most of the predictive-analytics people are looking at grades,'' Dr. Ram said. ''A lot of times it's not the grades but whether they feel comfortable and socially integrated. If they are not socially integrated, they drop out.''\par \par \uc2 Dr. Ram has tracked nearly 30,000 students over the last three years. Matching her findings against actual dropouts, she said, she has an accuracy rate of about 85 percent, but her project is still in the testing phase. She says identities are kept private.\par \par \uc2 That's a major concern about big data: that student details could become public. It is not the only issue. Martin Kurzweil, a program director at Ithaka S + R, an education research organization, worries that students whose performance is setting off alarms could be discouraged from following their passion. ''Algorithm is not destiny,'' he said. ''It's important that human judgment is never removed from the process and that there is always an opportunity for a student to appeal a pathway that's being plotted for them.''\par \par \uc2 Another concern: the temptation to weed out at-risk students to improve a school's ranking. Could it happen? Mr. Kurzweil cites the president of Mount St. Mary's \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2 , in Maryland, who famously wanted to ''drown the bunnies'' who struggled.\par \par \uc2 ''There are risks,'' Mr. Kurzweil said. ''But I think the people in predictive analytics are mostly white hats, and they're doing it because they really believe they're helping students.''\par \par \uc2 Still, he described the field as a little like the Wild West: ''They've pushed ahead quickly without setting up the kinds of standards and governance that will mitigate risk.''\par \par \uc2 In June, Ithaka S + R and a team from Stanford brought together 73 specialists from universities, analytics companies, foundations and the Department of Education for three days of discussion on developing standards and ethical guidelines for big data on college campuses. They met at the Asilomar Conference Grounds on the Monterey Peninsula, where 41 years earlier scientists started work on the first guidelines for genetic research.\par \par \uc2 Some universities are staying on the sidelines. The financial commitment -- a half-million dollars or more over the course of a three-year contract that includes data analysis, software and training -- is significant. Some are simply uneasy about the concept, Mr. Kurzweil said, or are not convinced predictive analytics really works.\par \par \uc2 Laura Mercer, chief of staff to the president of Sinclair College, a two-year school in Dayton, Ohio, tells a story to counter that view. At Sinclair, a C in general psychology or in ''Foundations of Business'' was found to be a sign that students majoring in those subjects won't make it. She decided to take a look at the records of a few students who had taken the psychology course.\par \par \uc2 One woman who was planning to major in psychology had taken it and three other courses as a freshman in the fall of 2014. She earned three A's and a C.\par \par \uc2 ''It was a pretty decent start,'' Ms. Mercer said. ''But guess what? The C was in Psych 1100.'' In the spring of 2015, the student signed up for five classes. She withdrew from one. The next semester she withdrew from three of her five classes. This fall she took four classes and withdrew from all of them.\par \par \uc2 ''It was just what the analytics had predicted,'' Ms. Mercer said. ''I tend to be a little skeptical. It wasn't until I dove into the records and I saw, 'Yes, indeed, this is a problem.' ''\par \par \uc2 Joseph B. Treaster, a former Times reporter, is now a professor in the School of Communication at the University of Miami.\par \par \uc2 DRAWING (DRAWING BY MIRKO ILIC) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020170205ed250004p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Robert O. Work, the veteran defense official retained as deputy secretary by President Trump, calls them his ''A.I. dudes.'' The breezy moniker belies their serious task: The dudes have been a kitchen cabinet of sorts, and have advised Mr. Work as he has sought to reshape warfare by bringing artificial intelligence to the battlefield.\par \par \uc2 Last spring, he asked, ''O.K., you guys are the smartest guys in A.I., right?''\par \par \uc2 No, the dudes told him, ''the smartest guys are at \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Google\uc2 ,'' Mr. Work recalled in an interview.\par \par \uc2 Now, increasingly, they're also in China. The United States no longer has a strategic monopoly on the technology, which is widely seen as the key factor in the next generation of warfare.\par \par \uc2 The Pentagon's plan to bring A.I. to the military is taking shape as Chinese researchers assert themselves in the nascent technology field. And that shift is reflected in surprising commercial advances in artificial intelligence among Chinese companies.\par \par \uc2 Last year, for example, \uc2 Microsoft\uc2  researchers proclaimed that the company had created software capable of matching human skills in understanding speech.\par \par \uc2 Although they boasted that they had outperformed their United States competitors, a well-known A.I. researcher who leads a Silicon Valley laboratory for the Chinese web services company Baidu gently taunted \uc2 Microsoft\uc2 , noting that Baidu had achieved similar accuracy with the Chinese language two years earlier.\par \par \uc2 That, in a nutshell, is the challenge the United States faces as it embarks on a new military strategy founded on the assumption of its continued superiority in technologies such as robotics and artificial intelligence.\par \par \uc2 First announced last year by \uc2 Ashton B. Carter\uc2 , President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's defense secretary, the ''Third Offset'' strategy provides a formula for maintaining a military advantage in the face of a renewed rivalry with China and Russia.\par \par \uc2 Well into the 1960s, the United States held a military advantage based on technological leadership in nuclear weapons. In the 1970s, that perceived lead shifted to smart weapons, based on brand-new Silicon Valley technologies like computer chips. Now, the nation's leaders plan on retaining that military advantage with a significant commitment to artificial intelligence and robotic weapons.\par \par \uc2 But the global technology balance of power is shifting. From the 1950s through the 1980s, the United States carefully guarded its advantage. It led the world in computer and material science technology, and it jealously hoarded its leadership with military secrecy and export controls.\par \par \uc2 In the late 1980s, the emergence of the inexpensive and universally available microchip upended the Pentagon's ability to control technological progress. Now, rather than trickling down from military and advanced corporate laboratories, today's new technologies increasingly come from consumer electronics firms. Put simply, the companies that make the fastest computers are the same ones that put things under our Christmas trees.\par \par \uc2 As consumer electronics manufacturing has moved to Asia, both Chinese companies and the nation's government laboratories are making major investments in artificial intelligence.\par \par \uc2 The advance of the Chinese was underscored last month when \uc2 Qi Lu\uc2 , a veteran Microsoft artificial intelligence specialist, left the company to become chief operating officer at Baidu, where he will oversee the company's ambitious plan to become a global leader in A.I.\par \par \uc2 And last year, Tencent, developer of the mobile app \uc2 WeChat\uc2 , a \uc2 Facebook\uc2  competitor, created an artificial intelligence research laboratory and began investing in United States-based A.I. companies.\par \par \uc2 Rapid Chinese progress has touched off a debate in the United States between military strategists and technologists over whether the Chinese are merely imitating advances or are engaged in independent innovation that will soon overtake the United States in the field.\par \par \uc2 ''The Chinese leadership is increasingly thinking about how to ensure they are competitive in the next wave of technologies,'' said \uc2 Adam Segal\uc2 , a specialist in emerging technologies and national security at \uc2 the Council on Foreign Relations\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In August, the state-run China Daily reported that the country had embarked on the development of a cruise missile system with a ''high level'' of artificial intelligence. The new system appears to be a response to a missile the \uc2 United States Navy\uc2  is expected to deploy in 2018 to counter growing Chinese military influence in the Pacific.\par \par \uc2 Known as the Long Range Anti-Ship Missile, or L.R.A.S.M., it is described as a ''semiautonomous'' weapon. According to the Pentagon, this means that though targets are chosen by human soldiers, the missile uses artificial intelligence technology to avoid defenses and make final targeting decisions.\par \par \uc2 The new Chinese weapon typifies a strategy known as ''remote warfare,'' said John Arquilla, a military strategist at the Naval Post Graduate School in Monterey, Calif. The idea is to build large fleets of small ships that deploy missiles, to attack an enemy with larger ships, like aircraft carriers.\par \par \uc2 ''They are making their machines more creative,'' he said. ''A little bit of automation gives the machines a tremendous boost.''\par \par \uc2 Whether or not the Chinese will quickly catch the United States in artificial intelligence and robotics technologies is a matter of intense discussion and disagreement in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Andrew Ng\uc2 , chief scientist at Baidu, said the United States may be too myopic and self-confident to understand the speed of the Chinese competition.\par \par \uc2 ''There are many occasions of something being simultaneously invented in China and elsewhere, or being invented first in China and then later making it overseas,'' he said. ''But then U.S. media reports only on the U.S. version. This leads to a misperception of those ideas having been first invented in the U.S.''\par \par \uc2 A key example of Chinese progress that goes largely unreported in the United States is Iflytek, an artificial intelligence company that has focused on speech recognition and understanding natural language. The company has won international competitions both in speech synthesis and in translation between Chinese- and English-language texts.\par \par \uc2 The company, which Chinese technologists said has a close relationship with the government for development of surveillance technology, said it is working with the Ministry of Science and Technology on a ''Humanoid Answering Robot.''\par \par \uc2 ''Our goal is to send the machine to attend the college entrance examination, and to be admitted by key national universities in the near future,'' said Qingfeng Liu, Iflytek's chief executive.\par \par \uc2 The speed of the Chinese technologists, compared to United States and European artificial intelligence developers, is noteworthy. Last April, Gansha Wu, then the director of Intel's laboratory in China, left his post and began assembling a team of researchers from \uc2 Intel\uc2  and \uc2 Google\uc2  to build a self-driving car company. Last month, the company, Uisee Technology, met its goal -- taking a demonstration to the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas -- after just nine months of work.\par \par \uc2 ''The A.I. technologies, including machine vision, sensor fusion, planning and control, on our car are completely home-brewed,'' Mr. Wu said. ''We wrote every line by ourselves.''\par \par \uc2 Their first vehicle is intended for controlled environments like college and corporate campuses, with the ultimate goal of designing a shared fleet of autonomous taxis.\par \par \uc2 The United States' view of China's advance may be starting to change. Last October, a White House report on artificial intelligence included several footnotes suggesting that China is now publishing more research than scholars here.\par \par \uc2 Still, some scientists say the quantity of academic papers does not tell us much about innovation. And there are indications that China has only recently begun to make A.I. a priority in its military systems.\par \par \uc2 ''I think while China is definitely making progress in A.I. systems, it is nowhere close to matching the U.S.,'' said Abhijit Singh, a former Indian military officer who is now a naval weapons analyst at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi.\par \par \uc2 Chinese researchers who are directly involved in artificial intelligence work in China have a very different view.\par \par \uc2 ''It is indisputable that Chinese authors are a significant force in A.I., and their position has been increasing drastically in the past five years,'' said \uc2 Kai-Fu Lee\uc2 , a Taiwanese-born artificial intelligence researcher who played a key role in establishing both \uc2 Microsoft\uc2 's and \uc2 Google\uc2 's China-based research laboratories.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Lee, now a venture capitalist who invests in both China and the United States, acknowledged that the United States is still the global leader but believes that the gap has drastically narrowed. His firm, Sinovation Ventures, has recently raised $675 million to invest in A.I. both in the United States and in China.\par \par \uc2 ''Using a chess analogy,'' he said, ''we might say that grandmasters are still largely North American, but Chinese occupy increasingly greater portions of the master-level A.I. scientists.''\par \par \uc2 What is not in dispute is that the close ties between Silicon Valley and China both in terms of investment and research, and the open nature of much of the American A.I. research community, has made the most advanced technology easily available to China.\par \par \uc2 In addition to setting up research outposts such as Baidu's Silicon Valley A.I. Laboratory, Chinese citizens, including government employees, routinely audit \uc2 Stanford \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  artificial intelligence courses.\par \par \uc2 One Stanford professor, Richard Socher, said it was easy to spot the Chinese nationals because after the first few weeks, his students would often skip class, choosing instead to view videos of the lectures. The Chinese auditors, on the other hand, would continue to attend, taking their seats at the front of the classroom.\par \par \uc2 Artificial intelligence is only one part of the tech frontier where China is advancing rapidly.\par \par \uc2 Last year, China also brought the world's fastest supercomputer, the Sunway TaihuLight, online, supplanting another Chinese model that had been the world's fastest. The new supercomputer is thought to be part of a broader Chinese push to begin driving innovation, a shift from its role as a manufacturing hub for components and devices designed in the United States and elsewhere.\par \par \uc2 In a reflection of the desire to become a center of innovation, the processors in the new computer are of a native Chinese design. The earlier supercomputer, the Tianhe 2, was powered by \uc2 Intel\uc2 's Xeon processors; after it came online, the United States banned further export of the chips to China, in hopes of limiting the Chinese push into supercomputing.\par \par \uc2 The new supercomputer, like similar machines anywhere in the world, has a variety of uses, and does not by itself represent a direct military challenge. It can be used to model climate change situations, for instance, or to perform analysis of large data sets.\par \par \uc2 But similar advances in high-performance computing being made by the Chinese could be used to push ahead with machine-learning research, which would have military applications, along with more typical defense functions, such as simulating nuclear weapons tests or breaking the encryption used by adversaries.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, while there appear to be relatively cozy relationships between the Chinese government and commercial technology efforts, the same cannot be said about the United States. The Pentagon recently restarted its beachhead in Silicon Valley, known as the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental facility, or DIUx. It is an attempt to rethink bureaucratic United States government contracting practices in terms of the faster and more fluid style of Silicon Valley.\par \par \uc2 The government has not yet undone the damage to its relationship with the Valley brought about by Edward J. Snowden's revelations about the \uc2 National Security Agency\uc2 's surveillance practices. Many Silicon Valley firms remain hesitant to be seen as working too closely with the Pentagon out of fear of losing access to China's market.\par \par \uc2 ''There are smaller companies, the companies who sort of decided that they're going to be in the defense business, like a Palantir,'' said Peter W. Singer, an expert in the future of war at New America, a think tank in Washington, referring to the Palo Alto, Calif., start-up founded in part by the venture capitalist \uc2 Peter Thiel\uc2 . ''But if you're thinking about the big, iconic tech companies, they can't become defense contractors and still expect to get access to the Chinese market.''\par \par \uc2 Those concerns are real for Silicon Valley.\par \par \uc2 ''No one sort of overtly says that, because the Pentagon can't say it's about China, and the tech companies can't,'' Mr. Singer said. ''But it's there in the background.''\par \par \uc2 Top: Robert O. Work, left, the deputy secretary of defense, with James R. Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence, and Marcel Lettre, under secretary of defense for intelligence, in November.

\par\par \uc2 Foreign Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc14}{\*\bkmkend toc14}\b \uc2 Bulgaria Grows Uneasy as Trump Complicates Its Ties to Russia\b0\par\par\uc2 By RICK LYMAN; Boryana Dzhambazova contributed reporting. \par \uc2 1,635 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 February 2017\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 SOFIA, Bulgaria -- With one foot in the West and the other in the East, Bulgaria has long engaged in a delicate balancing act.\par \par \uc2 But now the country, and its new president, Rumen Radev, will have to learn how to balance Donald J. Trump and an increasingly energized \uc2 Vladimir V. Putin\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Radev contemplated his new role as balancer in chief two days before he was sworn in on Jan. 19, sitting across the street from the presidential palace in the labyrinthine former headquarters of the Bulgarian Communist Party.\par \par \uc2 ''We have a clear road map to follow,'' Mr. Radev said. ''Staying in the E.U. and staying in \uc2 NATO\uc2 . But at the same time, we have a deep historical relationship with Russia.''\par \par \uc2 Countries like Bulgaria have spent decades balancing East and West, and playing one off the other. But the prospect of President Trump's moving closer to Mr. Putin has scrambled that strategy, as have the conflicting messages coming out of the new American administration.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump has seemed eager for closer Kremlin ties, even echoing Moscow's disdain for \uc2 NATO\uc2  and the \uc2 European Union\uc2 . But last week, his new ambassador echoed the Obama administration's harder line, saying the United States would not withdraw sanctions against Russia until the country pulled its troops out of Crimea.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, Mr. Putin has been showing new signs of swagger in his dealings with Russia's neighbors; on Thursday he arrived in Hungary for his first foray into Europe in the Trump era.\par \par \uc2 Bulgaria is an eager member of the \uc2 European Union\uc2 , but as rising nationalism caused support for the union to wane, here and elsewhere, Russian influence has crept in. On the surface, this suggests that Mr. Trump's outreach to Moscow, if genuine, would be good for Bulgaria -- and, indeed, nationalists are thrilled.\par \par \uc2 But Bulgaria has also known so many betrayals and occupations that this sudden lurch has inspired as much worry as elation, including fears that Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin will forge a bargain between themselves that serves their two nations but carves up the region into spheres of influence, just as the major powers did at the end of World War II.\par \par \uc2 For many reasons, including economic necessity, a common culture and deep historical ties, Bulgarian politicians, including the president, want closer relations with Russia, but not so close that their nation loses its cherished ties to the West and falls firmly into Russia's orbit.\par \par \uc2 It is unclear whether Bulgaria's old balancing act will work in the emerging international order. Indeed, similar calculations are being made throughout Central and Eastern Europe as leaders wait to see what Mr. Trump has in mind.\par \par \uc2 It was the subtext of the meeting in Budapest last week between Mr. Putin and Hungary's autocratic prime minister, \uc2 Viktor Orban\uc2 , at which the two expressed the desire for friendly relations but did not mention sticky issues like the Crimean sanctions.\par \par \uc2 For Bulgaria, the poorest member of the \uc2 European Union\uc2  and the one with the deepest ties to Russia, the ride has been a particularly turbulent one.\par \par \uc2 After the initial euphoria over the collapse of Communism and membership in the \uc2 European Union\uc2  in 2007 and \uc2 NATO\uc2  in 2004, disappointments followed. The slow pace of economic growth, persistent corruption, domineering oligarchs and a dependence on Russian oil and gas caused many politicians in Bulgaria and elsewhere to pivot eastward. A growing number of populists and nationalists found much to admire in Mr. Putin's autocratic approach.\par \par \uc2 When Bulgaria was accepted into the \uc2 European Union\uc2 , the country turned westward with great zeal. Money poured in from Brussels. Hundreds of thousands of Bulgarians seized the chance to move to Britain, Germany and elsewhere. But the growing ambivalence about the union was apparent as recently as last month when the 10th anniversary of Bulgaria's entrance into the union passed with barely any public celebration or notice.\par \par \uc2 Now pro-Western voices are on the defensive in Bulgaria, and the tenor of national politics has shifted in a more Russia-friendly way. How confusion over Mr. Trump's actual intentions toward Moscow will affect that dynamic remains to be seen. Mr. Trump's manner of talking has already emboldened nationalists and populists throughout Central and Eastern Europe -- including Mr. Orban and Milos Zeman, the Czech Republic's president -- to sharpen their own talk and offer the Kremlin an even friendlier hand, even as many analysts warn against creeping influence from Russia.\par \par \uc2 ''The more you go to the East, the more you see more authoritarian systems and more corrupt practices,'' said Ognyan Minchev, executive director of the Institute for Regional and International Studies and a professor of political science at the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Sofia. ''If it is not guarded, it will erode, and this process will move to the West. It is a battle, and it is a battle for a region that is historically defined as no man's land.''\par \par \uc2 A big question hanging over the \uc2 European Union\uc2  this year is how much Mr. Putin will try to influence critical elections in France, Germany and the Netherlands -- as well as in less prominent contests like November's vote to replace a Czech Parliament that has remained firmly pro-Western despite its president's friendliness toward Mr. Putin.\par \par \uc2 ''The pro-Europeans are in retreat. In the coming year, Merkel may fall,'' said Ruslan Stefanov, director of the economic program at the Center for the Study of Democracy in Sofia, referring to Chancellor \uc2 Angela Merkel\uc2  of Germany. ''The Netherlands may leave the union. Italy. France. It's a brave new world.''\par \par \uc2 Historical and cultural ties between Russia and Bulgaria are deeply emotional, one reason that pro-Moscow sentiment is gathering political momentum.\par \par \uc2 ''Improving relations with Russia is good for Bulgaria, the United States and the world,'' said Nikolai Malinov, the chairman of the National Movement of Russophiles, founded in 2003. ''When you are banging weapons, or imposing sanctions, it is not good. We have to heal those wounds.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Malinov's group, which claims 35,000 members, describes itself as a cultural organization, staging concerts, maintaining monuments to Bulgaria's past with Russia, erecting monuments and pushing for more Russian-language training.\par \par \uc2 In Bulgaria, the president acts as head of state and commander in chief of the military, but most political power resides with the prime minister. Boyko Borissov, who took a slightly more pro-Western tilt but also strongly favored close ties with Moscow, stepped down as prime minister after Mr. Radev's victory.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Radev had 20 opponents in his race for president, said Ivo Indzhev, a pro-Western journalist. Just one, he said, explicitly echoed the trans-Atlantic alliance's language toward sanctions against Russia over its seizure of Crimea. Yet the paradox of this eastward shift is the growing anxiety that Bulgaria could become a geopolitical bargaining chip.\par \par \uc2 ''This is nothing new for Eastern Europe, to be part of a game plan that is reminiscent of Yalta,'' said Ilian Vassilev, Bulgarian ambassador to Russia from 2000 to 2006. ''President Trump can do whatever he wants to do within the bounds of the U.S. Constitution, but he cannot replace the feeling Eastern Europeans have that they are being betrayed. A deal is going on over their heads.''\par \par \uc2 Bulgaria has a stubborn culture of corruption and oligarchic control, which the Kremlin has been adept at exploiting in service of expanding its influence.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies\uc2  and the Sofia-based Center for the Study of Democracy released a study in October. Called ''The Kremlin Playbook,'' it characterized Bulgaria as the most deeply penetrated by Russia financially. Investment with Russian roots, direct and indirect, accounts for more than 22 percent of Bulgaria's gross domestic product, marking the country as a ''captured state,'' said the study, of which Mr. Stefanov was an author.\par \par \uc2 Increasing Russian penetration was also found in Slovakia, Latvia, Serbia and Hungary.\par \par \uc2 ''In one way or another, all of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe have become captured states of the oligarchic network which emerged from the old security services of the Communist regimes,'' Dr. Minchev said in an interview. ''They went underground and re-emerged as this new, so-called business elite.''\par \par \uc2 Peter Kreko, a Hungarian political analyst and visiting professor in the central Eurasian studies department at \uc2 Indiana \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2 , thinks the talk of friendlier relations between Washington and Moscow is already having an impact on European nationalists.\par \par \uc2 ''Definitely, it's seen as a green light for populist and nationalist leaders across Europe to accelerate their moves toward Russia,'' Dr. Kreko said.\par \par \uc2 But he thinks those leaders -- who see the Euro-Atlantic alliance and its emphasis on democracy and human rights as threats to their power -- are fooling themselves if they believe that a grand bargain between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin will benefit them.\par \par \uc2 ''If there is a big deal, if there is a big bargain, will they play any role in that?'' Dr. Kreko said. ''I don't think so.''\par \par \uc2 The larger worry, he and other analysts said, is that such a grand bargain would propel Mr. Putin's goal of again declaring spheres of influence between East and West -- resulting in a reduced American presence in the region and a greater Russian one.\par \par \uc2 ''For those of us who have always believed the U.S. is a beacon of hope, it is a shock,'' Mr. Vassilev said. ''The most pro-American guys in Bulgaria are turning against America because they cannot tell the difference between Putin and Trump.''\par \par \uc2 Bulgaria's new president, Rumen Radev, noted its ''deep historical relationship with Russia.''

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 They called him the Beast.\par \par \uc2 David Fajgenbaum was the fittest of his friends at the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Pennsylvania\uc2 's medical school, a 6-foot-3 gym addict and former quarterback at Georgetown. His mammoth hands seemed more suited to spiraling footballs than the fine fingerwork a doctor-in-training might need. He had endurance to match, taking multiple hits and returning to the field to play on.\par \par \uc2 ''This guy was a physical specimen,'' said his former roommate, Grant Mitchell, who used to walk to work with him. When they would arrive at the hospital for his obstetrics rotation, his friend recalled, ''he would basically coerce me into doing pull-ups on the tree outside.''\par \par \uc2 In July 2010, that all changed. The 25-year-old woke up at night drenched in sweat. His lymph nodes were swollen. He felt stabs of abdominal pain, and odd red bumps began sprouting across his chest. Most bizarre of all, he felt very tired -- so tired that he began slipping into empty exam rooms between patients, stealing five-minute naps to get through the day.\par \par \uc2 ''Guys, I think I'm dying,'' he recalled telling his friends.\par \par \uc2 A visit to the emergency room confirmed his fears. A doctor told him that his liver, kidneys and bone marrow were not working properly. Even more troubling, the doctor had no idea why his body was failing. ''What do you think is going on?'' he remembers the doctor asking him.\par \par \uc2 Pursuing the answer to that question, it turned out, would become his life's work. It would transform Dr. Fajgenbaum from a patient on the brink of death five different times, whose illness stumped specialist after specialist, to one of the leading researchers in his field. He has even used himself as his own test subject, and may have discovered a treatment for his rare disease.\par \par \uc2 His story, which has been circulating inside medicine, is more than one person's remarkable journey, however. It offers a look into the world of rare diseases, a corner of medicine that continues to frustrate -- and flummox -- those who seek cures for obscure conditions. About 95 percent of all rare diseases have no approved drug treatments.\par \par \uc2 Fewer than 8,000 people in the United States are found to have Dr. Fajgenbaum's condition in any given year. But taken as a whole, rare diseases are not unusual: An estimated 30 million people in the country -- or about 10 percent of the population -- are living with one of the nearly 7,000 rare diseases that have been identified.\par \par \uc2 Prompted by financial incentives passed by Congress, the drug industry is hotly pursuing treatments for a throng of rare diseases. That has led to breakthroughs in several conditions, including cystic fibrosis and spinal muscular atrophy. Nevertheless, with a small number of subjects to study and relatively few people to sell new drugs to, many rare diseases are overlooked by doctors and scientists, hampered by a lack of resources and public awareness.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Fajgenbaum's condition is one of the many that have been given relatively little attention. Initially, doctors thought he had a common form of cancer. A CT scan -- a series of images that give doctors a clearer picture of what is going on inside the body -- revealed a body riddled with enlarged lymph nodes, a hallmark of lymphoma. The news struck a particularly cruel blow: Only a few years earlier, while Dr. Fajgenbaum was in college, his mother died of brain cancer.\par \par \uc2 He declined rapidly as his immune system went haywire. A retinal hemorrhage, a type of ministroke, temporarily blinded his left eye. Fluids leaked out of his blood vessels, a sign that his liver was failing. Over the next two weeks, he gained about 70 pounds of extra fluid and his brain fogged over.\par \par \uc2 For those who knew him as the Beast, the transformation was jarring.\par \par \uc2 ''Even when he got sicker and sicker and eventually went into the hospital, it was kind of like this, oh, weird, Dave must have some really awful virus -- that's one hell of a flu,'' his friend Dr. Mitchell said.\par \par \uc2 When Dr. Fajgenbaum's brain started slowing down, Dr. Mitchell said, the severity of the illness sunk in. ''I would ask him a simple question, and he would answer in a couple words, like 30 seconds to a minute later,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Mitchell and the other medical students scoured textbooks and the internet, searching for clues. The top medical experts at Penn, meanwhile, were not having much more luck. Lymphoma was just one theory. Others thought it might be a severe case of lupus or even mononucleosis. But test after test was inconclusive.\par \par \uc2 Finally, the doctors tried a huge dose of steroids. Slowly, his body began to fight its way back. His kidneys and liver began functioning again, and the extra fluid receded. Seven weeks after he was admitted, Dr. Fajgenbaum walked out of the hospital. It was September 2010.\par \par \uc2 ''I remember asking the doctor, saying, 'What was this?''' he said. ''And I remember the doctor saying, 'We don't know what it was, but let's just hope it doesn't come back.'''\par \par \uc2 It took only one month for symptoms to come rushing back, while he was convalescing at his childhood home in Raleigh, N.C. Doctors there shipped a piece of his lymph node to the \uc2 Mayo Clinic\uc2  in Minnesota, where pathologists finally pinpointed his disease. The condition, called Castleman disease, was so rare that doctors at the hospital in Raleigh had no experience with it.\par \par \uc2 Castleman disease had been known since the 1950s but has remained largely a mystery. A hallmark of the condition is enlarged lymph nodes, and most people with the disease -- about two-thirds -- have a form that affects just one part of the body and can usually be cured through surgery.\par \par \uc2 The form ravaging Dr. Fajgenbaum's body -- multicentric Castleman disease -- is even more rare and deadly. Only about 1,200 to 1,500 people are discovered to have it every year in the United States. It defied classification, occupying a no man's land between cancer and immune disease. Doctors weren't sure of the cause in patients like him: Some believed it was a type of cancer, while others thought it was an inherited genetic disorder, or was triggered by a virus.\par \par \uc2 One thing was clear: The disease was deadly. Only about 65 percent of people with the condition live for five years after it is diagnosed, studies have shown.\par \par \uc2 Over the next few years, Dr. Fajgenbaum alternated between extended periods of relative health and frightening relapses. His condition stumped even leading experts in the disease, people like Dr. Frits van Rhee of Little Rock, Ark., who has treated the largest number of patients -- about 100 -- with Castleman.\par \par \uc2 The tools that Dr. van Rhee and others had were blunt and harmful in their own right. More than once, Dr. Fajgenbaum underwent a devastating, 21-day course of chemotherapy that annihilated his immune system in an effort to knock his disease into remission.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Fajgenbaum was also granted emergency access to siltuximab, a drug that \uc2 Johnson & Johnson\uc2  was developing for people with his form of multicentric Castleman disease, which would be approved in 2014. That year, in 2011, Dr. van Rhee secured a rare exception to try it on Dr. Fajgenbaum.\par \par \uc2 But the drug, like other previous treatments, did not work.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Fajgenbaum was undaunted. With the zeal he once devoted to bench-pressing a personal best -- 375 pounds, reached six months before he first fell ill -- he dove into the scientific research on Castleman disease and began to familiarize himself with the world's top experts.\par \par \uc2 On Sundays, his roommate tried to coax Dr. Fajgenbaum out of his bedroom, with its white board covered in notes, organizational plans tacked to the wall. He rarely succeeded. ''I'm on the couch watching TV, and Dave is just cranking away on Castleman,'' Dr. Mitchell recalled.\par \par \uc2 The more Dr. Fajgenbaum learned, he said, the more he realized how much the field that studied Castleman was in disarray. Researchers focusing on the disease used different terminology to describe the condition, making it difficult to compare published work. Leading experts weren't in regular communication, and studies were being done over again, even though previous ones had failed.\par \par \uc2 ''It became just abundantly clear that just because you have smart people thinking about a problem doesn't mean that it's coordinated at all,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 One of the people he called was Dr. Thomas Uldrick, a clinical researcher at the National Cancer Institute who had studied multicentric Castleman disease. The two struck up a correspondence. ''Clearly he was a very bright medical student, and he was scared of dying from this disease,'' Dr. Uldrick recalled.\par \par \uc2 He also began collaborating with Dr. van Rhee, who knew that Dr. Fajgenbaum was a different kind of patient after he arrived armed with charts, graphs, timelines and slide presentations. ''There are patients who keep meticulous records,'' Dr. van Rhee said with a chuckle, ''but he was definitely in the top 1 percent.''\par \par \uc2 In spring 2013 Dr. Fajgenbaum earned his medical degree, and a few months later he entered the \uc2 Wharton School\uc2  at Penn, reasoning that, to solve the tangled mystery of Castleman disease, business smarts would serve him well.\par \par \uc2 But in December of that year he got sick again, with his blood platelets dropping so low that he barely avoided a fatal brain bleed.\par \par \uc2 This time, though, he was able to use his relapse to further his search for a cure.\par \par \uc2 For months, Dr. Fajgenbaum had been collecting weekly blood samples that served as snapshots of his immune system, tabulating the results in a spreadsheet and adding them to a detailed slide presentation that he had been preparing since he received the diagnosis. And when it was clear the disease had returned, he persuaded his doctors to remove a piece of a lymph node, test it and save it for future research.\par \par \uc2 After a round of chemotherapy, he improved enough to be discharged and started looking into what secrets the tests might reveal. It turned out that five months before he started noticing symptoms in December, his T cells -- one of the key weapons in the body's immune arsenal -- had starting activating, preparing for a fight even though there was no apparent threat. Then, about three months before his relapse, he noticed that he had started producing more VEGF, a protein that instructs the body to make more blood vessels, and is another sign of an immune system gearing up.\par \par \uc2 These two hints gave him an idea: Maybe the problem was with one of the body's communication lines, the one that triggered production of VEGF and also told the T cells to begin activating. If Dr. Fajgenbaum could get his body to shut down that communication line -- known as the mTOR pathway -- he might be able to stop his immune system from overreacting and prevent a relapse.\par \par \uc2 The discovery was exhilarating. ''I felt like I was part of steering the ship,'' Dr. Fajgenbaum said. ''This time I was part of this team.''\par \par \uc2 With this major clue in hand, he and his doctors turned to potential treatments, existing drugs that were known to shut down the mTOR pathway. The one that seemed the best option was practically hiding in plain sight. Sirolimus, also known as Rapamune, was commonly given to kidney transplant patients to prevent their bodies from rejecting the organ. The drug had been on the market for years and was known to have few serious side effects.\par \par \uc2 ''I wouldn't think I ever could have prescribed this to another patient, or told a patient to try it, because we just didn't have very much data,'' Dr. Fajgenbaum said. ''But at this stage, I'd had four episodes, and I'd failed everything the doctors had ever given me.''\par \par \uc2 In choosing to become his own test subject, Dr. Fajgenbaum was following a long line of medical researchers who have experimented on themselves. At the turn of the 20th century, government researchers studying yellow fever in Cuba allowed themselves to be bitten by mosquitoes who harbored the disease; one researcher caught the fever and died. In 1929, Dr. Werner Forssman inserted a catheter into the vein of his arm and guided it to his heart to prove that the procedure worked (he shared in a Nobel Prize for his work in 1956). As recently as 2005, Dr. Barry Marshall won the Nobel after drinking a broth infected with bacteria to prove that it caused ulcers.\par \par \uc2 This activist approach, Dr. Uldrick said, did not sit well with everyone. ''There was some tension between the various doctors about who was driving the boat,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 But the idea that Dr. Fajgenbaum needed to try something new was unanimous: Chemotherapy had worked three times, but the powerful drugs take a heavy toll and can themselves cause cancer if given too often.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Fajgenbaum eventually prevailed. In January 2014, he stopped taking his old cancer drugs and started on sirolimus. Six months passed, then a year. The weekly blood tests showed that his immune system was returning to normal.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Fajgenbaum, his health improving, returned to the other challenges that were hampering progress in the field of Castleman disease. He started the Castleman Disease Collaborative Network, a nonprofit whose mission was to prioritize and coordinate research into the disease, which operates out of the Perelman School of Medicine at Penn. Dr. Fajgenbaum, an assistant professor of medicine at the school, and his collaborators assembled an advisory panel of the world's experts in the disease and set an agenda for answering the most pressing questions.\par \par \uc2 First on the list is figuring out the cause: Is the disease genetic, a form of cancer or caused by a virus?\par \par \uc2 As always, the work is intensely personal. Last summer, he drove to Allentown, Pa., to collect a blood sample from a patient with Castleman disease. He placed the vials in his vest pocket, explaining that he needed to keep the blood warm so the tests he had planned would work properly.\par \par \uc2 ''You remind me of a mother hen,'' the patient said with a laugh.\par \par \uc2 That gave him an idea: Dr. Fajgenbaum sat on the vials as he drove two hours back to Philadelphia, the car heater cranked up to ensure they were warm. It was a sweaty ride back, but worth it. ''These samples are precious,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 In medical research, discoveries come slowly and take twists and turns that no one saw coming. Seasoned researchers have learned to rein in their optimism and to know that true breakthroughs can take years, if not decades, to realize. Not Dr. Fajgenbaum.\par \par \uc2 ''I almost wish that every disease had a David to be a part of the charge,'' said Dr. Mary Jo Lechowicz, a professor at the Emory \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  School of Medicine, who has studied Castleman disease and serves on the network's advisory board.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Fajgenbaum's single-minded mission to take on his own disease is also typical of the rare-disease world, said Max Bronstein, the chief advocacy and science policy officer at the EveryLife Foundation for Rare Diseases in Novato, Calif.\par \par \uc2 ''A lot of mom-and-pop patient organizations emerge to take on these huge challenges in rare diseases,'' he said. ''I don't think there's one correct model for each disease; there's been so many different approaches.''\par \par \uc2 Last month, Dr. Fajgenbaum marked his three-year anniversary since starting on sirolimus, a period more than twice as long as any of his other remissions. ''I feel 100 percent,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 These days, Dr. Fajgenbaum, now 31, walks through the hallways of Penn's medical center, his frame again projecting the easy confidence of the athlete he once was. But he jokes that he would have to pull out photos of his days as a quarterback to explain to people why his friends still call him the Beast.\par \par \uc2 Now, he said, every time he tries to exercise, his mind wanders back to an email he needs to write or a call he needs to make. ''It's not because I don't have the energy to do it; it's because all of my energy is going toward this disease,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Not everyone is convinced that sirolimus is what has been keeping him healthy. Dr. van Rhee noted that while the results in Dr. Fajgenbaum are promising, his is just one case and treatments need to be proven in many more people. ''I think the finding is very interesting,'' he said, ''but we need to see whether a similar mechanism is active in other patients.''\par \par \uc2 But Dr. Fajgenbaum said he grew more confident every day that it is the drug that is helping. He has begun sharing his experience with more doctors and researchers, is conducting laboratory tests to see if the drug is likely to work in other patients and has started writing an article about his experience for a medical journal. Soon, he hopes, doctors will begin prescribing the drug to other patients.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Fajgenbaum is optimistic about the drug's chances but is aware medical science is unpredictable. ''Who knows; maybe it will work for only a small percentage,'' he said. ''So we've still got a lot of work ahead of us.''\par \par \uc2 He now oversees the network's research from his office in the Hospital of the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Pennsylvania, five floors above the emergency room where he first learned his body was falling apart. It is also the same building where he spent weeks in the I.C.U., so sick that he said his final goodbyes to friends and family.\par \par \uc2 At first, when he learned his office would be in the same building, he felt anxious, unsure if he wanted the constant reminder of the ordeal he had endured. A few months ago, Dr. Fajgenbaum was called to the I.C.U. to meet a patient who had just found out he had Castleman disease. He spoke to the patient about enrolling him in a new study, and as he looked out the window, realized the view looked familiar.\par \par \uc2 On his way out, he bumped into a nurse who remembered him. She noted that he had stayed in the same room as a patient.\par \par \uc2 Ultimately, he said, he is glad for the proximity. ''I didn't think that I would ever get to leave the hospital, and now here I am, fighting back,'' he said. ''It's the ultimate motivator.''\par \par \uc2 Above, Clarice Maggio, a nurse, checks the port on Dr. David Fajgenbaum's chest through which he will receive treatment at the Hospital of the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Pennsylvania.

\par\par \uc2 OP-ED COLUMNIST\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTSR\par {\*\bkmkstart toc16}{\*\bkmkend toc16}\b \uc2 Me, Me, Me, Me, Me\b0\par\par\uc2 By FRANK BRUNI \par \uc2 1,291 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 February 2017\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 3\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 President Trump has a tense relationship, to say the least, with African-Americans. He earned it. He built his political base in part by questioning the legitimacy of the first black president and demanding to see his birth certificate. He used racism for traction.\par \par \uc2 So what was his demeanor on Wednesday, when he marked Black History Month by sitting down with a handful of black leaders (supporters, really) in the Roosevelt Room? Did he ramp up the courtesy? Tamp down the self-congratulation? Go out of his way to emphasize that he'd be a president for all and that he fully appreciated the struggles and hardships of black Americans over time?\par \par \uc2 Not so much.\par \par \uc2 But he did talk about his struggles. His hardships. He couldn't mention Martin Luther King Jr. without flashing on the King bust in the Oval Office, noting that there had been an erroneous report of its removal and lamenting what he sees as his terrible victimization by biased journalists and ''fake news.''\par \par \uc2 King's martyrdom became Trump's martyrdom. Black History Month turned into Trump Appreciation Day.\par \par \uc2 Me, me, me, me, me.\par \par \uc2 There's no topic that Trump can't bring back around to himself, no cause as compelling as his own. And while I and many others have examined his outsize egomania before, its migration into his administration can't be noted too often or overstated.\par \par \uc2 This isn't just some random brush stroke in his portrait. It's his primary color. It's everything. It drives policy. It warps diplomacy. And it badly hobbles his leadership, because you can't inspire others if nearly all of your energy goes so transparently and unabashedly into inflating yourself. At the least you have to do a pantomime of altruism and self-effacement. Trump seldom even tries.\par \par \uc2 Consider last week's telephone call with the prime minister of Australia. The news accounts of this rightly focused on Trump's gratuitous combativeness with the leader of one of our closest allies, but I was equally riveted by another detail: The president spent a portion of the call reliving and reveling in his Electoral College victory.\par \par \uc2 He did the exact same thing at the start of his hourlong talk with about two dozen of us at The Times back in November -- never mind that we were well aware of that triumph, having plastered it across our front page and atop our website.\par \par \uc2 He did it at those bizarre postelection rallies, billed as a thank-you tour though it was really a behold-me strut. I'm told that he did it, too, during interviews with prospective members of his administration.\par \par \uc2 By the time he got to his inauguration, his masturbatory reveries had morphed into the claim that he was the helmsman of ''a historic movement, the likes of which the world has never seen.'' The Bolsheviks might quibble, and I might point out that only 77,000 ballots in three states gave him that Electoral College win, in contrast to the nearly three million ballots by which he lost the popular vote. The math doesn't flatter the movement.\par \par \uc2 But that's the smaller problem with his assessment. The larger one is that when you're selling a revolution and convincing yourself of it, you're obliged to scale your actions to your exaggerations. They must be as sweeping as the supposed circumstances -- it's central to the delusion, integral to the illusion. Hence the wall. Hence the immigration ban. Hence all the executive orders signed and still to come.\par \par \uc2 The hyperbole trickles down and is taken up by \uc2 Sean Spicer\uc2  and, of course, by Kellyanne Conway. It is at this point that we should pause and bow our heads in remembrance of the victims of the Bowling Green Massacre.\par \par \uc2 New footage of the Bowling Green Massacre. #neverforget pic.twitter.com/9CNDkCvNu7 -- Queenteree (@Teree) February 3, 2017\par \par \uc2 Will Trump's foreign policy be the Me Doctrine? Will Russia get love not because Moscow mirrors our ideals but because \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2  holds a flattering mirror up to Trump? This possibility persists, though United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley's recent declaration that the United States wouldn't lift sanctions against Russia until it pulled troops out of Crimea was a hopeful sign that Putin hadn't entirely bedazzled Trump.\par \par \uc2 Trump's analysis of people and situations hinges on whether they exalt him. A news organization that challenges him is inevitably ''failing.'' A politician who pushes back at him is invariably a loser. Middle-school cliques have more moral discernment.\par \par \uc2 He railed against executive orders until they were his. He denounced the coziness between politicians and Wall Street until he was doing the snuggling. He cried foul at presidential getaways that cost the taxpayers millions until Mar-a-Lago beckoned.\par \par \uc2 During the campaign he demonstrated no special concern for free speech, advocating looser libel laws and barring certain news organizations from events. But he took to Twitter on Thursday to register fury over the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of California at Berkeley\uc2 's cancellation of an appearance by the far-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos.\par \par \uc2 Could this be explained by Yiannopoulos's affiliation with Breitbart News and professed lust for Trump? (''I call myself a Trump-sexual,'' Yiannopoulos once said.) I somehow doubt that Trump would have threatened ''NO FEDERAL FUNDS'' for Berkeley if the school had nixed Sarah Silverman.\par \par \uc2 If \uc2 U.C. Berkeley\uc2  does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view - NO FEDERAL FUNDS? -- \uc2 Donald J. Trump\uc2  (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017\par \par \uc2 And Trump's copious tweeting is about self-aggrandizement and instant gratification. You know how some animals spread their wings, broaden their chests or stand extra tall to impress mates and intimidate rivals? That's Trump with the ''caps lock'' key.\par \par \uc2 All in all it was some last week for President Me. At the National Prayer Breakfast, he recommended prayers for \uc2 Arnold Schwarzenegger\uc2 , which was a way to remind everyone -- yet again -- that his own ratings on ''The Apprentice'' were much higher.\par \par \uc2 Thus commenced an exchange on Twitter in which Schwarzenegger cleverly offered to swap jobs with Trump and Trump responded by saying that he was rubber, Schwarzenegger was glue and everything Schwarzenegger said bounced back and stuck to him. I jest, but barely. Trump tweeted, oh so presidentially, that Schwarzenegger had been a terrible California governor.\par \par \uc2 Yes, \uc2 Arnold Schwarzenegger\uc2  did a really bad job as Governor of California and even worse on the Apprentice...but at least he tried hard! -- \uc2 Donald J. Trump\uc2  (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2017\par \par \uc2 Still, Trump's performance with black supporters in the Roosevelt Room was his masterpiece of me-ism.\par \par \uc2 He slipped in a thank you to Fox News because it ''treated me very nice.'' He shared his belief -- no, his fantasy -- that black voters so liked his campaign message that they voted for him in unexpectedly high numbers. (He got 8 percent of the black vote.)\par \par \uc2 ''In the entirety of his opening remarks,'' wrote Chris Cillizza in The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 , ''Trump said absolutely nothing that didn't tie directly back to him in some way, shape or form. His election results. His views on the media. His election results again.''\par \par \uc2 The meeting, Cillizza added, was fresh proof of ''how different this president and presidency is from every one that has come before it.'' Trump probably managed to divine a compliment in that statement.\par \par \uc2 I invite you to follow me on Twitter (@FrankBruni) and join me on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 DRAWING (DRAWING BY BEN WISEMAN) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020170205ed250004d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- The Trump administration filed an appeal late Saturday night of a Federal District Court ruling that blocked the president's immigration order, setting the stage for a legal showdown over his authority to tighten the nation's borders in the name of protecting Americans from terrorism.\par \par \uc2 The appeal asserted the president's constitutional authority to order the temporary immigration ban and said the court ruling ''second-guesses the President's national security judgment,'' and is causing harm. It came at the end of a chaotic day in which the government complied with the district court's ruling by allowing the entry of refugees and travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations, even as Mr. Trump unleashed a fusillade of criticism at the ruling, and the judge who had issued it.\par \par \uc2 At airports around the world, small numbers of travelers from the previously banned countries began venturing trips to the United States, knowing the judge's ruling could be overturned at any time. The State Department reversed its cancellation of visas for people from the seven affected countries -- Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen -- and aid groups scrambled to take advantage of what they acknowledged might be a brief window for refugees to enter the United States.\par \par \uc2 On Saturday night, as Mr. Trump arrived at a Red Cross gala at Mar-a-Lago, his waterfront Florida resort, where he was spending the first getaway weekend of his presidency, reporters asked him if he was confident he would prevail in the government's appeal. ''We'll win,'' he replied. ''For the safety of the country, we'll win.''\par \par \uc2 The legal maneuvering led Mr. Trump to lash out at Judge James Robart of the Federal District Court in Seattle throughout the day, prompting criticism that the president had failed to respect the judicial branch and its power to check on his authority.\par \par \uc2 In an early-morning \uc2 Twitter\uc2  post, Mr. Trump wrote, ''The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!''\par \par \uc2 The Justice Department's filing seeks to have the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit block the judge's decision and asks that the lower court's ruling be stayed pending the appeal.\par \par \uc2 In its argument for an appeal, the Justice Department said the president had an ''unreviewable authority'' to suspend the entry of any class of foreigners. It said the ruling by Judge Robart was too broad, ''untethered'' to the claims of the state of Washington, and in conflict with a ruling by another federal district judge, in Boston, who had upheld the order.\par \par \uc2 The Justice Department argued that the president acted well within his constitutional authority. Blocking the order, it concluded, ''immediately harms the public by thwarting enforcement of an Executive Order issued by the President, based on his national security judgment.''\par \par \uc2 Judge Robart, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, declared in his ruling on Friday that ''there's no support'' for the administration's argument that ''we have to protect the U.S. from individuals'' from the affected countries.\par \par \uc2 His ruling also barred the administration from enforcing its limits on accepting refugees. The State Department said Saturday that refugees, including Syrians, could begin arriving as early as Monday. Syrians had faced an indefinite ban under the executive order. His ruling applied nationwide.\par \par \uc2 It is not clear how quickly the Ninth Circuit court will act. In a note posted Saturday night on its electronic filing system, the court said it would soon issue an order setting a briefing schedule. In ordinary cases, the first brief would not be filed for almost a month, but the federal government will no doubt ask the appeals court to move much faster. In emergency matters, the appeals court's rules sometimes allow a single judge to act alone, or to convene a three-judge panel by telephone.\par \par \uc2 Despite Mr. Trump's vehement criticism of the ruling and the certainty that it would be appealed, the government agencies at the center of the issue, the State Department and the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 , moved quickly to comply.\par \par \uc2 Lawrence Bartlett, the State Department's director of refugee resettlement, wrote in a departmental email that officials were working to rebook travel for refugees who had previously been scheduled to leave for the United States over a three-week period that will end Feb. 17. A State Department official said the extended time frame accounted for the fact that some refugees will have to make difficult journeys back to airports from refugee camps.\par \par \uc2 Until there is a new order from the courts, the official said, the department will go back to vetting refugees, booking their travel and bringing them to the United States. A United Nations spokesman, Leonard Doyle, said about 2,000 refugees were ready to travel.\par \par \uc2 Airlines, citing American customs officials, were telling passengers from the seven countries that their visas were once again valid. Those carriers, however, have yet to report an uptick in travel, and there appeared to be no rush to airports by visa holders in Europe and the Middle East intent on making their way to the United States.\par \par \uc2 Etihad Airways\uc2 , the United Arab Emirates' national carrier, said in a statement: ''Following advice received today from the \uc2 U.S. Customs and Border Protection\uc2  unit at Abu Dhabi Airport, the airline will again be accepting nationals from the seven countries named last week.'' Other Arab carriers, including \uc2 Qatar Airways\uc2 , issued similar statements.\par \par \uc2 A group of advocacy organizations that had worked to overturn the executive order and help immigrants and refugees stranded at airports issued a statement on Saturday afternoon encouraging travelers ''to rebook travel to the United States immediately.''\par \par \uc2 ''We have been in contact with hundreds of people impacted by the ban, and we are urging them to get on planes as quickly as possible,'' Clare Kane, a law student intern at the Jerome N. Frank Legal Services Organization at Yale Law School, one of the groups involved, said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 But some officials were being more cautious, advising travelers to wait for further clarity. The American Embassy in Baghdad said it was waiting for additional guidance from Washington. ''We don't know what the effect will be, but we're working to get more information,'' the embassy told The Associated Press in a statement.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  said it had suspended implementation of the order, including procedures to flag travelers from the countries designated in Mr. Trump's order. It said it would resume standard inspection procedures. But in a statement, the department defended the order as ''lawful and appropriate.''\par \par \uc2 In his first statement on the matter on Friday evening, the White House press secretary, \uc2 Sean Spicer\uc2 , described the judge's action as ''outrageous.'' Minutes later, the White House issued a new statement deleting the word outrageous.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump's \uc2 Twitter\uc2  post showed no such restraint. It recalled the attacks he made during the presidential campaign on a federal district judge in California who was presiding over a class-action lawsuit involving Trump \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Democrats said the president's criticism of Judge Robart was a dangerous development. Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, a member of the Judiciary Committee, said in a statement that Mr. Trump seemed ''intent on precipitating a constitutional crisis.'' Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, whose state filed the suit that led to the injunction, said the attack was ''beneath the dignity'' of the presidency and could ''lead America to calamity.''\par \par \uc2 Senator \uc2 Chuck Schumer\uc2  of New York, the Democratic leader, said in a statement that Mr. Trump's outburst could weigh on the confirmation process for Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, the president's nominee for the Supreme Court.\par \par \uc2 Until now, Mr. Trump had been comparatively restrained about the multiple federal judges who have ruled against parts of his immigration order, even as he staunchly defended its legality. Some analysts had speculated that he did not want a repeat of the storm during the campaign when he accused Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel of having a conflict of interest in the Trump \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  case because the judge's family was of Mexican heritage. Mr. Trump, who had painted Mexicans as rapists and criminals, settled that case after the election.\par \par \uc2 But on Saturday, Mr. Trump let loose, and in the afternoon he unleashed another volley of attacks on the ruling. In one \uc2 Twitter\uc2  message, he questioned why a judge could ''halt a Homeland Security travel ban,'' which would allow ''anyone, even with bad intentions,'' to enter the country. An hour later, he complained about the ''terrible decision,'' saying it would let ''many very bad and dangerous people'' pour into the country.\par \par \uc2 Earlier, Mr. Trump had asserted, without evidence, that some Middle Eastern countries supported the immigration order. ''Interesting that certain Middle-Eastern countries agree with the ban,'' he wrote. ''They know that if certain people are allowed in it's death & destruction!''\par \par \uc2 The Washington State case was filed on Monday, and it was assigned to Judge Robart that day. He asked for briefs on whether the state had standing to sue, with the last one due on Thursday. On Wednesday, Minnesota joined the suit.\par \par \uc2 On Friday evening, Judge Robart issued a temporary restraining order, requiring the government to revert to its previous immigration policies as the case moved forward. He found that the states and their citizens had been injured by Mr. Trump's order.\par \par \uc2 ''The executive order adversely affects the states' residents in areas of employment, education, business, family relations and freedom to travel,'' Judge Robart wrote. He said the states had been hurt because the order affected their public universities and their tax bases.\par \par \uc2 Still, Judge Robart's order left many questions, said Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law in Houston.\par \par \uc2 ''Does the executive order violate the equal protection of the laws, amount to an establishment of religion, violate rights of free exercise, or deprive aliens of due process of law?'' Professor Blackman asked. ''Who knows? The analysis is bare bones, and leaves the court of appeals, as well as the Supreme Court, with no basis to determine whether the nationwide injunction was proper.''\par \par \uc2 While large crowds had yet to materialize at airports, there were individual stories of people trying to enter the country.\par \par \uc2 Nael Zaino, 32, a Syrian who had tried unsuccessfully for nearly a week to fly to the United States to join his wife and American-born son, was allowed to board a flight from Istanbul and then Frankfurt late Friday. He landed in Boston around 1 p.m. Saturday and emerged from immigration two hours later, said his sister-in-law Katty Alhayek.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Zaino was believed to be among the first revoked visa holders to enter the United States since the executive order went into effect. His advocates had sought a waiver for him from the State Department, citing family reunification. ''Mine must be a very special case,'' Mr. Zaino said by phone from Istanbul.\par \par \uc2 Iranians, many of them students on their way to American universities, also rushed to book flights to transfer destinations in other Persian Gulf countries, Turkey and Europe. Pedram Paragomi, a 33-year-old Iranian medical student bound for the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Pittsburgh\uc2 , who had been caught up in the initial chaos over the travel ban, flew to Frankfurt on Saturday, where he was to transfer to a flight to Boston.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm anxious,'' he said from Frankfurt. ''The rules keep on changing, but I think I will make it this time.''\par \par \uc2 Judge Robart (A1); Akram Khajehali of Iran held her granddaughter as she was greeted by her son-in-law, Mahdi Hashemian, right, after arriving at Boston Logan Airport on Saturday. The Washington State attorney general, Bob Ferguson, left, won a temporary order to halt the travel ban nationwide.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Correction Appended\par \par \uc2 HYDERABAD, India \u8212\'20\'14 When the Islamic State identified a promising young recruit willing to carry out an attack in one of India\u8217\'20\'19s major tech hubs, the group made sure to arrange everything down to the bullets he needed to kill victims.\par \par \uc2 For 17 months, terrorist operatives guided the recruit, a young engineer named Mohammed Ibrahim Yazdani, through every step of what they planned to be the Islamic State\u8217\'20\'19s first strike on Indian soil.\par \par \uc2 They vetted each new member of the cell as Mr. Yazdani recruited helpers. They taught him how to pledge allegiance to the terrorist group and securely send the statement.\par \par \uc2 And from , investigators believe, the group\u8217\'20\'19s virtual plotters organized for the delivery of weapons as well as the precursor chemicals used to make explosives, directing the Indian men to hidden pickup spots.\par \par \uc2 Until just moments before the arrest of the Indian cell, here last June, the Islamic State\u8217\'20\'19s cyberplanners kept in near-constant touch with the men, according to the interrogation records of three of the eight suspects obtained by The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 As officials around the world have faced a confusing barrage of attacks dedicated to the Islamic State, cases like Mr. Yazdani\u8217\'20\'19s offer troubling examples of what counterterrorism experts are calling enabled or remote-controlled attacks: violence conceived and guided by operatives in areas controlled by the Islamic State whose only connection to the would-be attacker is the internet.\par \par \uc2 In the most basic enabled attacks, Islamic State handlers acted as confidants and coaches, coaxing recruits to embrace violence. In the Hyderabad plot, among the most involved found so far, the terrorist group reached deep into a country with to arrange for pistols and ammunition to be left in a bag swinging from the branches of a tree.\par \par \uc2 For the most part, the operatives who are conceiving and guiding such attacks are doing so from behind a wall of anonymity. When the Hyderabad plotters were arrested last summer, they could not so much as confirm the nationalities of their interlocutors in the Islamic State, let alone describe what they looked like. Because the recruits are instructed to use encrypted messaging applications, the guiding role played by the terrorist group often remains obscured.\par \par \uc2 As a result, remotely guided plots in Europe, Asia and the United States in recent years, , were initially labeled the work of \u8220\'20\'1Clone wolves,\u8221\'20\'1D with no operational ties to the Islamic State, and only later was direct communication with the group discovered.\par \par \uc2 While the trail of many of these plots led back to planners living in Syria, the very nature of the group\u8217\'20\'19s method of remote plotting means there is little dependence on its maintaining a safe haven there or in . And visa restrictions and mean little to attackers who strike where they live and no longer have to travel abroad for training.\par \par \uc2 Close examination of both successful and unsuccessful plots carried out in the Islamic State\u8217\'20\'19s name over the past three years indicates that such enabled attacks are making up a growing share of the operations of the group, which is also known as , ISIL or Daesh.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThey are virtual coaches who are providing guidance and encouragement throughout the process \u8212\'20\'14 from radicalization to recruitment into a specific plot,\u8221\'20\'1D said Nathaniel Barr, a terrorism analyst at Valens Global, who along with Daveed Gartenstein-Ross of the \uc2 Foundation for Defense of Democracies\uc2  in Washington wrote discussing the virtual plotters.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIf you look at the communications between the attackers and the virtual plotters, you will see that there is a direct line of communication to the point where they are egging them on minutes, even seconds, before the individual carries out an attack.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Detailing this kind of plot direction has become a critical focus of counterterrorism officials in the United States and Europe, as they try to track terror planners who pose a lasting threat and to unravel the criminal networks that the group uses as middlemen to facilitate attacks.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Yazdani\u8217\'20\'19s case presents one of the most detailed accounts to date of how the Islamic State is exporting terrorism virtually. This style of attack has allowed the terrorist group\u8217\'20\'19s reach to stretch into countries as disparate as France and Malaysia, Germany and , Bangladesh and Australia. And plots have been discovered in multiple locations in the United States, including in Columbus, Ohio, the suburbs of Washington and upstate New York.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI fear this is the future of ISIS,\u8221\'20\'1D said Bridget Moreng, an analyst whose was recently published in Foreign Affairs.\par \par \uc2 A Diverse Portfolio\par \par \uc2 Until roughly a year ago, Islamic State recruiters aggressively pushed the message that going to Syria was a spiritual obligation. They described the physical journey as a \u8220\'20\'1Chijrah,\u8221\'20\'1D the Arabic word used to refer to the Prophet Muhammad\u8217\'20\'19s journey to escape persecution in Mecca, imbuing the act with religious meaning.\par \par \uc2 The recruiters hid within an ocean of 2.3 billion live social media accounts, flooding the internet with romanticized videos of life inside the caliphate, as well as brutal execution videos, using them as clickbait to lure potential recruits.\par \par \uc2 One of the Islamic State\u8217\'20\'19s was known by the nom de guerre Abu Issa al-Amriki, and his \uc2 Twitter\uc2  profile instructed newcomers to contact him via the encrypted messaging app Telegram. Among those who sought him out, asking for instructions on how to reach Syria, was Mr. Yazdani, who had convinced himself that it was his religious duty to move his family to the caliphate.\par \par \uc2 By 2015, Amriki was one of close to a dozen cyberplanners based in Syria or Iraq who were already actively recruiting volunteers abroad, according to a tally based on investigation records from North America, Europe and Asia.\par \par \uc2 Initially, they made little effort to hide, posting grandiose threats against the West on public social media feeds. They were sometimes discounted as mere cheerleaders for the terrorist group.\par \par \uc2 But by the late spring of 2015, they were considered enough of a threat that both American and British intelligence began tracking their movements, methodically and killing several since then.\par \par \uc2 Among them was Amriki himself, who was killed along with his wife on April 22, 2016, when a bomb flattened their apartment in Al Bab, Syria. The Pentagon press secretary, Peter Cook, identified him as a Sudanese citizen also known as Abu Sa\u8217\'20\'19ad al-Sudani, and described him as one of the Islamic State\u8217\'20\'19s \u8220\'20\'1C\u8221\'20\'1D who \u8220\'20\'1Cactively sought to harm Western interests.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The Department of Defense\u8217\'20\'19s account showed, moreover, that the handler had been involved in far more than just the Hyderabad case, planning attacks on three continents.\par \par \uc2 At the same time that he was recruiting Mr. Yazdani, Amriki was grooming attackers in Canada and Britain, as well as at least three other young men in suburbs across America, according to court records. They living in Virginia; a warehouse worker ; and , a 25-year-old in Rochester.\par \par \uc2 Looking for ways to get to Syria, Mr. Lutchman reached out to Amriki on Dec. 25, 2015, asking what it was like to live inside territory controlled by the group. \u8220\'20\'1CDream come true,\u8221\'20\'1D Amriki responded, before telling the young man that the Syrian border had been closed, according to .\par \par \uc2 Instead, the handler suggested that Mr. Lutchman carry out an attack right at home on New Year\u8217\'20\'19s Eve \u8212\'20\'14 less than a week after their first exchange. Plan an \u8220\'20\'1Coperation\u8221\'20\'1D and kill \u8220\'20\'1C1000000s of kuffar,\u8221\'20\'1D Amriki instructed him, using a derogatory Arabic word meaning infidel. Over the course of several chats via the Telegram service, they planned how Mr. Lutchman would attack a bar serving craft beer to celebrate the holiday, prosecutors say.\par \par \uc2 The two men discussed recruiting three other \u8220\'20\'1Cbrothers\u8221\'20\'1D to take part. They stayed in contact as Mr. Lutchman went to \uc2 Walmart\uc2 , where he spent $40 on two ski masks, two knives, a machete, zip-ties, duct tape and latex gloves. He planned to abduct one of the bar\u8217\'20\'19s customers and videotape himself killing the victim, prosecutors say.\par \par \uc2 And they exchanged a flurry of messages, as the 25-year-old began to voice doubts and the handler assumed the role of therapist, patiently listening and reassuring him.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Lutchman was arrested at his home the day before his planned attack on Merchants Grill in Rochester, outed by the accomplice he had recruited, who turned out to be an F.B.I. informant.\par \par \uc2 At the time of his arrest, Mr. Lutchman had been communicating with the handler for a total of five days. It appears he never heard his handler\u8217\'20\'19s voice, or saw so much as a photograph of him, according to the court filings.\par \par \uc2 By late 2015, travel to Syria had become treacherous. Intelligence services on both sides of the Atlantic were getting better at identifying aspiring jihadists, arresting dozens as they prepared to board flights for Istanbul in hopes of crossing into Syria. At first, Islamic State operatives instructed recruits to throw off law enforcement by taking more indirect routes. They also began urging followers to head to other Islamic State colonies, including in Libya.\par \par \uc2 That was what a young man from Columbus, Aaron T. Daniels, was trying to do in November, when he was arrested while trying to board a \uc2 United Airlines\uc2  flight to Houston, from where he would travel to Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, before continuing toward Libya.\par \par \uc2 No longer describing the journey to Syria as a spiritual necessity, the Islamic State announced last year that those who could not reach the caliphate should attack at home.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIf the tyrants have closed in your faces the door of hijrah, then open in their face the door of jihad,\u8221\'20\'1D the group\u8217\'20\'19s spokesman, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, said in a message released in May.\par \par \uc2 Local Assets\par \par \uc2 At the time Amriki was , he had been exchanging messages with Mr. Yazdani in India for more than a year, patiently offering encouragement as his recruit tried and failed to get a visa first to Greece, and then to Turkey in an effort to reach Syria.\par \par \uc2 One of eight children, Mr. Yazdani, who is now 30, grew up in a cramped apartment in the slum of Aman Nagar B, in a narrow alley that smells of sewage in Hyderabad\u8217\'20\'19s Old City. He beat the odds, earning an engineering degree and landing a job as a quality inspector in Saudi Arabia for nearly four years, before returning to India.\par \par \uc2 While abroad, he began watching the Islamic State\u8217\'20\'19s online propaganda, and soon he became consumed by a desire to leave it all for the caliphate.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CSince then, I was inclined to join Islamic State and work for the cause of religion,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr. Yazdani told investigators from \uc2 India\u8217\'20\'19s National Investigation Agency\uc2 , according to his interrogation record, which was obtained by The Times and was first reported by NDTV, a New Delhi-based television company.\par \par \uc2 He logged into \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and searched the hashtags #ISIS and #Khilafa, the terrorist group\u8217\'20\'19s preferred spelling of caliphate. In a few keystrokes, he made contact with Amriki.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI created a Telegram ID,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr. Yazdani told investigators, \u8220\'20\'1Cand sought his guidance to reach Syria.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 After months of frustrating and failed attempts to help Mr. Yazdani get a visa, Amriki\u8217\'20\'19s directions changed course: \u8220\'20\'1CHe asked me to work for I.S. by staying in India itself.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 It was a period in which the Islamic State was refining the way it exports terror, increasingly relying on . Just before his death, Amriki handed off Mr. Yazdani to a different handler, known only by his Telegram screen name, \u8220\'20\'1CWindsofVictory.\u8221\'20\'1D His identity has not yet been confirmed by Indian officials, though they believe he is Indian because he spoke fluent Hindi.\par \par \uc2 The new handler guided the eight-member cell as it took shape, exchanging messages with Mr. Yazdani as the engineer recruited his family members and friends. They named themselves \u8220\'20\'1CJund-ul-Khilafa-Fi-Bilad-Hind,\u8221\'20\'1D the Army of the Caliphate in India, according to the interrogation records, which misspelled part of the Arabic name.\par \par \uc2 At the end of May, Mr. Yazdani received a message telling him to go to the Nanded Airport, about 200 miles away. He and an accomplice, Habeeb Mohammed, 31, drove all night. After they reached the airport the next morning, the handler told them to head to the Railway Division Office. Near that office, he said, they would see a plastic bag hanging from a tree, according to the transcripts of the men\u8217\'20\'19s interrogations.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt was informed by the handler that opposite to DRM office, there are two trees and on one of the trees there would be a white color polythene sheet (used for wrapping fragile articles),\u8221\'20\'1D Mr. Mohammed told investigators. \u8220\'20\'1CWe spotted the place, and I, first on the pretext of urinating, went to check for the consignment.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 When they opened the bag, they found two pistols and 20 bullets, according to their account to law enforcement. It was one of at least four drops that the handler set up for them.\par \par \uc2 Because the pistols were rusted, they say the handler instructed them to travel to the railway station in the city of Ajmer, about 600 miles to the north. This time they were told to bring 65,000 rupees \u8212\'20\'14 around $1,000 \u8212\'20\'14 and leave it near the railway track sealed in a plastic bag, which would be picked up and used as payment for weapons.\par \par \uc2 Because the communication always had to go through the handler, the members of the Hyderabad cell never directly interacted with the arms seller. When they were arrested, they could not provide any clues as to who had left the contraband, Indian investigators said.\par \par \uc2 The Hindi-speaking handler guiding the men in Hyderabad also insisted on using a kaleidoscope of encrypted messaging applications, with Mr. Yazdani instructed to hop between apps so that even if one message history was discovered and cracked, it would reveal only a portion of their handiwork.\par \par \uc2 As soon as Mr. Yazdani indicated he was willing to undertake an attack, the handler instructed him to download ChatSecure, a messaging app to be used when they spoke by phone. When he used his laptop, he was told to contact the handler via Pidgin, another encrypted tool. He was told to create an account with Tutanota, a secure email service. And the handler taught Mr. Yazdani how to use the Tails operating system, which is contained on a USB stick and allows a user to boot up a computer from the external device and use it without leaving a trace on the hard drive.\par \par \uc2 Once that system was in place, the handler told Mr. Yazdani to prepare a handwritten oath of allegiance, known as a \u8220\'20\'1Cbayah,\u8221\'20\'1D to the Islamic State\u8217\'20\'19s leader.\par \par \uc2 Members of the cell signed it using their noms de guerre, and Mr. Yazdani was told to scan it to his laptop, using Tails to obscure the operation. Next, he was told to upload it to , which allows users to upload files and produces a URL that can be shared with a third party. The link to the URL was to be sent via the secure email.\par \par \uc2 By methodically working through URLs archived on the website, The Times was able to find the image of the one-page handwritten document containing the Indian men\u8217\'20\'19s pledge of allegiance to the Islamic State. The file was uploaded around the time that Mr. Yazdani told investigators he had done so, and the document matched his description of the wording he had disclosed to the authorities. Until they were alerted to its existence, Indian investigators were not aware that the document was still archived on the website, they said.\par \par \uc2 The men\u8217\'20\'19s families have denied that they played any role in a terrorist plot, and accuse the authorities of planting evidence against them.\par \par \uc2 One Indian investigator, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief reporters, said officials were able to crack the full extent of the case only because Mr. Yazdani and his accomplices confessed during interrogation, divulging the passwords to their accounts after their arrests last summer.\par \par \uc2 Global Reach\par \par \uc2 Though the Hyderabad case is among the most detailed in showing how Syria-based handlers directly facilitated terrorist attacks abroad, it is neither the first, nor the only one. Investigation documents from Europe show that a growing share of attacks bear signs of contact with the Islamic State\u8217\'20\'19s stronghold, even though the attacker was initially described as acting alone.\par \par \uc2 The first time that officials in Europe described an attack as having been \u8220\'20\'1C,\u8221\'20\'1D or remote-controlled, was in the spring of 2015 after a young information technology student named Sid Ahmed Ghlam tried to open fire on a church in the Paris suburb of Villejuif. Instead, he shot himself in the leg.\par \par \uc2 When the police searched his car, they found his Lenovo laptop containing a series of messages showing how he, too, had been guided by a pair of handlers who provided both the weapons and the getaway car, according to hundreds of pages of police and intelligence records obtained by The Times.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COK, brother, now pay attention,\u8221\'20\'1D one of the messages begins, instructing the then-23-year-old to head to the suburb of Aulnay-sous-Bois, where he would find the automatic weapons in a bag left in a locked car parked near a sandwich shop. \u8220\'20\'1CSearch among the cars that are parked there near the big road and look for a Renault M\u233\'00\'E9gane,\u8221\'20\'1D the message said. \u8220\'20\'1CLook at the front right tire \u8212\'20\'14 you\u8217\'20\'19ll find the keys placed on top.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The handler then instructed him to store the weapons in another car in a parking garage 10 miles away, a precaution in case his apartment was searched.\par \par \uc2 Later, French investigators said they had found that Mr. Ghlam\u8217\'20\'19s handlers were French citizens who had traveled to Syria to join the Islamic State. They, in turn, tapped their criminal network back in France to arrange the logistics of Mr. Ghlam\u8217\'20\'19s plot.\par \par \uc2 Seamus Hughes, the at \uc2 George Washington \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2 , said the handlers were essentially \u8220\'20\'1Cquarterbacking\u8221\'20\'1D the attack: \u8220\'20\'1CThey\u8217\'20\'19re from there, so they can essentially tell someone, \u8216\'20\'18O.K., go 10 yards and go this way.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Wiretaps, interrogation records and transcripts of chats recovered on suspects\u8217\'20\'19 phones and laptops show that this level of guidance has occurred all over the world.\par \par \uc2 , a man who set off a bomb outside a concert and a teenager who assaulted train passengers with an ax were both chatting with handlers until minutes before their attacks. The teenager\u8217\'20\'19s handler urged him to use a car instead of an ax \u8212\'20\'14 \u8220\'20\'1CThe damage would be much greater,\u8221\'20\'1D the handler advised \u8212\'20\'14 but the young man said he did not have a driving permit. \u8220\'20\'1CI want to enter paradise tonight,\u8221\'20\'1D he said, according to a obtained by a German newspaper.\par \par \uc2 In northern France, a pair of attackers slit the throat of an 85-year-old priest. The pair had not known each other, and according to the investigative file, the handler introduced them, organizing for them to meet days before the attack. Intelligence records obtained by The Times reveal that the also guided a group of young women who tried to blow up a car in front of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris.\par \par \uc2 And investigations into attacks in , and reveal that the recruits were directly communicating with Islamic State handlers who molded the plots as they took shape and helped arrange logistics, in some cases wiring money.\par \par \uc2 In several, a pattern has emerged: The attacker initially tries to reach Syria, but is either blocked by the authorities in the home country or else turned back from the border. Under the instructions of a handler in Syria or Iraq, the person then begins planning an attack at home.\par \par \uc2 Law enforcement officials describe that sequence of events in one of , where a group of people are accused of plotting to hit the popular Christmas market in the city of Strasbourg, having been given the GPS coordinates of a location to pick up weapons. At least one of the five men arrested so far had been turned back from Turkey, French prosecutors said.\par \par \uc2 Weak Links\par \par \uc2 While a reliance on local amateurs has allowed the Islamic State to announce that it can stage terrorism around the world, it has also led to many failed attacks.\par \par \uc2 Instead of opening fire on a church, Mr. Ghlam shot himself in the leg. Instead of laying waste to a music festival this past summer, the, killing only himself.\par \par \uc2 happened the day before the end of Ramadan on July 2 inside a police compound in Indonesia, where another remotely guided attacker hit the switch on his crudely assembled suicide vest.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CHe didn\u8217\'20\'19t even knock over the flowerpot on the ledge next to where he blew himself up,\u8221\'20\'1D said , director of the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict.\par \par \uc2 Indonesian officials say that the suicide bomber had been incited to attack by Bahrun Naim, a 33-year-old Indonesian man who is now one of the Islamic State\u8217\'20\'19s most prolific cyberplanners, operating from the group\u8217\'20\'19s capital in Raqqa, Syria.\par \par \uc2 Initially, Mr. Naim wired money to families in Indonesia to pay for travel to Syria, officials said. Later, the bank transfers he sent were to be used to buy the chemicals needed to build explosives, according to the interrogation records of his recruits.\par \par \uc2 In just over a year, the young men with whom he was in touch attempted at least six attacks, targeting a police post, a Buddhist temple and a church, as well as foreigners visiting the country. In November, a college dropout who the police said had at least been initially in contact with Mr. Naim was arrested as he the embassy of Myanmar. In his home, the police recovered a quantity of explosives that could have resulted in a blast twice as powerful as the 2002 Bali bombing, which killed 202 people, the police spokesman told local news media.\par \par \uc2 Yet nearly all of the plots attributed to Mr. Naim have failed. And it was human error that finally led to the arrest of Amriki\u8217\'20\'19s followers in Hyderabad.\par \par \uc2 The plot began to unravel in June after the men were instructed to collect a 10-kilogram bag of ammonium nitrate left beside a canal next to mile marker No. 9 on the Vijayawada Highway.\par \par \uc2 They returned to Mr. Mohammed\u8217\'20\'19s home to begin preparing a bomb, but could not figure out how to replicate the steps in the instructional \uc2 YouTube\uc2  video sent to them by the handler. \u8220\'20\'1CWe could not succeed in making powder, as it became jellylike paste,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr. Yazdani lamented, according to the transcript of his interrogation.\par \par \uc2 They tried using a tea strainer. They tried heating it longer. They began talking on their cellphones about their efforts to \u8220\'20\'1Ccook the rice.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 By then, the police were wiretapping their calls and suspected that all the food talk was a crude attempt at misdirection. Early on June 29, the police banged on the door of Mr. Mohammed\u8217\'20\'19s home.\par \par \uc2 In his bedroom, they found the half-cooked explosive in his refrigerator.\par \par \uc2 Reporting was contributed by Suhasini Raj from Hyderabad and New Delhi, Runa Sandvik from New York, and Eric Schmitt and Adam Goldman from Washington.\par \par \uc2 Correction: February 4, 2017, Saturday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Earlier versions of this article incorrectly identified the embassy in Indonesia that had been targeted for a bombing.

The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Trump\u8217\'20\'19s nominee for the Supreme Court, must publicly condemn the president\u8217\'20\'19s attack on the judge who blocked his immigration order. Judge Gorsuch\u8217\'20\'19s sterling credentials notwithstanding, his supporters in the legal community should withdraw their support for his nomination if he fails to do so.\par \par \uc2 After Judge James Robart\u8217\'20\'19s ruling, Mr. Trump wrote on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , \u8220\'20\'1CThe opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!\u8221\'20\'1D Mr. Trump may be right that the order will be stayed or overturned \u8212\'20\'14 the legal merits are tricky, and Judge Robart has not heard full briefing of them yet. But the attack on Judge Robart\u8217\'20\'19s integrity is indefensible.\par \par \uc2 Federal judges have frustrated American presidents since the founding. Thomas Jefferson fulminated against judicial overreach and tried to get a Supreme Court justice impeached. Andrew Jackson disregarded a judicial order from the Supreme Court; Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus; and Franklin Roosevelt tried to pack the Supreme Court with his own appointees after it blocked many of his New Deal reforms. In his 2010 State of the Union address, President Obama criticized an opinion of the Supreme Court on campaign finance reform in front of some of the justices.\par \par \uc2 But, by and large, presidents have respected the federal judiciary. As far as I know, no president has publicly challenged the integrity of a judge who has ruled against him. Mr. Trump, as in so many other cases, has broken new ground.\par \par \uc2 His attack on Judge Robart comes at a fraught moment. During Mr. Trump\u8217\'20\'19s campaign, his reckless statements were dismissed by his supporters as mere rhetoric. When Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel ruled against him in the Trump \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  case, Mr. Trump called him a \u8220\'20\'1Ctotal disgrace\u8221\'20\'1D and accused him of bias because he was \u8220\'20\'1CMexican\u8221\'20\'1D (actually, an American citizen of Mexican descent). It might have been barely possible to see this offensive statement as red meat for the base rather than a considered judgment about the integrity of the federal judiciary. Not anymore.\par \par \uc2 Now that Mr. Trump is president, his words matter. When federal judges in New York, Virginia and Massachusetts initially blocked Mr. Trump\u8217\'20\'19s travel ban a week ago, reports emerged that border agents disobeyed the courts or obeyed only grudgingly. Whatever happened, Mr. Trump\u8217\'20\'19s attack on Judge Robart\u8217\'20\'19s integrity could encourage executive branch officials to disregard other judicial orders, and will further inflame people\u8217\'20\'19s distrust of border agents, whether they do or not.\par \par \uc2 Worse, Mr. Trump has made it clear that he regards any judge who thwarts his designs as a personal enemy. If Judge Robart\u8217\'20\'19s order reaches the Court of Appeals in the Ninth Circuit, the appellate judges will need to worry that if they reverse Judge Robart, they will be seen by the public as validating Mr. Trump\u8217\'20\'19s attack on the district judge, further damaging the judiciary\u8217\'20\'19s reputation for impartiality. If they uphold his order, Trump may attack them as well. Whatever they do, the damage has been done. And this could happen again and again as Trump pushes through his program.\par \par \uc2 True, the government has complied with Judge Robart\u8217\'20\'19s order for the time being. Mr. Trump\u8217\'20\'19s remark shows his typical Machiavellian shrewdness. By merely insulting the judge, rather than threatening to disobey him, he is testing the waters. If the public approves the attack, Mr. Trump will be goaded forward to explicit disobedience. In the face of silence, he may hesitate. Only sustained opprobrium can prevent repetition.\par \par \uc2 This brings us to Judge Gorsuch. He is the only judge in whom the president has publicly expressed confidence \u8212\'20\'14 by nominating him to a judicial position. A rebuke from Judge Gorsuch would be a stinging blow. It would, or at least might, protect the judiciary from further attacks from Mr. Trump for years to come.\par \par \uc2 On the merits, Mr. Gorsuch is a shoo-in for the Supreme Court. He is a widely respected judge, praised for his integrity and independence. Normally, we do not expect a nominee to take a position on political issues, or to comment on pending cases, which could force him to recuse himself on the court.\par \par \uc2 And Judge Gorsuch should not take a position on whether the president\u8217\'20\'19s immigration order is unlawful, or make political arguments of any kind. What he should do is stand up for the judiciary. He should declare that the president of the United States should not attack the integrity of a sitting judge.\par \par \uc2 This is hardly a political statement. It is a view about the Constitution, one that Judge Gorsuch has already expressed in a judicial opinion:\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe framers lived in an age when judges had to curry favor with the crown in order to secure their tenure and salary and their decisions not infrequently followed their interests. Indeed, the framers cited this problem as among the leading reasons for their declaration of independence\u8230\'20\'26. To this day, one of the surest proofs any nation enjoys an independent judiciary must be that the government can and does lose in litigation before its \u8220\'20\'1Cown\u8221\'20\'1D courts like anyone else.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Right you are, Judge Gorsuch. Now say it again.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.facebook.com/nytopinion"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Facebook}}}\uc2  and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/NYTOpinion"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Twitter}}}\uc2  (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/opiniontoday/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Opinion Today newsletter}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Eric Posner is a professor at the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Chicago Law School.\par \par \uc2 President Trump with Judge Neil Gorsuch in the East Room of the White House after announcing Mr. Gorsuch as his nominee for the Supreme Court. | Carolyn Kaster/Associated Press.. \par \par \uc2 Document NYTFEED020170204ed24004ph\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Decades before President Trump nominated him to be labor secretary, \uc2 Andrew Puzder\uc2  went to battle with federal labor regulators in a Las Vegas courtroom.\par \par \uc2 The year was 1983, and Mr. Puzder was working at a law firm owned by a famous mob lawyer and casino owner whom the Labor Department accused of squandering $25 million from his union workers' pension funds on sham investments.\par \par \uc2 It fell to Mr. Puzder to lead the defense, which he framed in aggressively antigovernment terms. In his opening statement, Mr. Puzder told the jury it was not his boss's fault for not paying back the money -- it was overzealous regulators in Washington who had killed off a good business deal by intervening before his investments could succeed, he said.\par \par \uc2 ''We should not be required to pay for the mistakes of the Department of Labor'' and the union, Mr. Puzder said, according to The \uc2 Las Vegas Review-Journal\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The jury did not buy it. Mr. Puzder's boss, Morris A. Shenker, was hit with a $34 million judgment and filed for bankruptcy.\par \par \uc2 More than three decades later, the lawyers who represented the Labor Department in the case recall Mr. Puzder as bright and capable, but they still marvel that he blamed government regulators.\par \par \uc2 ''I personally find there is some irony in him being nominated to be the secretary of labor,'' said Daly D. E. Temchine, the lead lawyer in the case for the Department of Labor. ''Back then, he represented a guy who thought it was O.K. to screw his employees.''\par \par \uc2 As it turned out, Mr. Puzder's arguments in the case foreshadowed positions he would take after leaving the practice of law to become chief executive of a fast-food company. He has repeatedly argued that labor regulations stifle economic growth. He has indicated his preference for machines over people because they do not take time off or file lawsuits. And a recording recently surfaced of him referring to his employees as ''the best of the worst.''\par \par \uc2 Because he was a lawyer representing a client, the positions that Mr. Puzder took in the case do not necessarily represent his personal views. But Mr. Shenker was more than just a client: He was also Mr. Puzder's first boss, one he chose to work for, an associate said, specifically because it gave him the chance to litigate this case and a second similar one.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Puzder declined to comment for this article, but upon nominating him in December, Mr. Trump said Mr. Puzder would ''fight to make American workers safer'' and ''save small businesses from the crushing burdens of unnecessary regulations that are stunting job growth.''\par \par \uc2 Worker advocates have opposed Mr. Puzder's nomination, citing lawsuits that workers filed against \uc2 CKE Restaurants\uc2 , the parent company of Carl's Jr. and \uc2 Hardee's\uc2 , as well as wage violations at those restaurants. Mr. Puzder is chief executive of CKE.\par \par \uc2 His confirmation hearing before a Senate committee has been delayed four times. His spokesman said Mr. Puzder, 66, was working to divest from his company.\par \par \uc2 ''He doesn't view laws and regulations as things that help protect the most vulnerable from exploitation. He looks at them as things that hinder him from doing what he wants to do,'' said Judy Conti, who oversees federal advocacy for the National Employment Law Project. ''That's antithetical to the mission of the Department of Labor.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Shenker led a life fit for the movies. A Jew, he fled Russia as an orphaned teenager in the 1920s to join his older brothers in St. Louis. He went on to become one of the best-connected lawyers in America.\par \par \uc2 He was also a mob lawyer. In his thick accent, Mr. Shenker sometimes said he would rather see a guilty man go free than an innocent man go to jail. But his work on behalf of organized crime figures went beyond the courtroom.\par \par \uc2 Through one of his most notorious clients, the former Teamsters president \uc2 Jimmy Hoffa\uc2 , Mr. Shenker gained influence in the mid-1960s over the \uc2 Teamsters\uc2 ' enormous Central States pension fund. According to an investigation by Life magazine, Mr. Shenker built a fortune from fees he was paid to fast-track loans from the fund to businesses. In 1973, he took control of the Dunes Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas and a resort in California.\par \par \uc2 Married and supporting two children, Mr. Puzder began working at the Shenker law firm while a full-time student at Washington \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  School of Law in St. Louis, finding it more attractive than the construction work he had been doing to earn money.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Puzder joined the firm full time after graduating in 1978, a career choice that bewildered some who knew him. The firm was fading in relevance, with its famous principal spending much of his time in Las Vegas.\par \par \uc2 But Peter Sadowski, who worked part time at the firm with Mr. Puzder while both were in law school, said Mr. Shenker had enticed Mr. Puzder with the chance to handle the high-profile lawsuit already underway in Las Vegas.\par \par \uc2 ''Shenker wanted him to lead the defense,'' said Mr. Sadowski, now an executive vice president at Fidelity National Financial, a major seller of title insurance. \uc2 Politico\uc2  recently reported on Mr. Puzder's work for Mr. Shenker.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Shenker's fortunes had changed quickly after Congress passed the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, which, among other things, protects worker pensions from being raided by their employers.\par \par \uc2 The next year, the \uc2 Teamsters\uc2  pension fund backed out of a $40 million loan that Mr. Shenker wanted for an expansion of the Dunes. Mr. Shenker sued, and the Labor Department joined the case with the pension fund.\par \par \uc2 In 1980, after a federal judge summarily dismissed the case halfway through the trial, Mr. Puzder presented the appeal at the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco, arguing, in part, that the loan was promised before the new law took effect.\par \par \uc2 In court filings, Labor Department lawyers described Mr. Puzder's efforts as ''a vigorous but futile attempt to backpedal, sidestep, and otherwise avoid the absolute barriers'' of the pension protection act known as Erisa. The appellate judges denied Mr. Puzder's appeal.\par \par \uc2 By then, another spigot of union pension money had gone dry.\par \par \uc2 The pension fund for the culinary workers union in Las Vegas had been extending loans to Mr. Shenker with no restrictions since 1973. A new pension fund chairman -- Richard P. Crane, a former federal prosecutor -- was appointed in 1976 and concluded that the Shenker loans were ''a total rip-off.'' He insisted on all but shutting down the flow of money.\par \par \uc2 ''Shenker went nuts,'' Mr. Crane recalled.\par \par \uc2 In 1977, the Labor Department sued Mr. Shenker, accusing him of failing to repay the $24.9 million it said he had illegally borrowed from the Southern Nevada Culinary and Bartenders Pension Trust. The total represented more than half of the trust's assets.\par \par \uc2 The case proceeded slowly. During a 1982 hearing of the Senate committee that oversees labor, Senator \uc2 Orrin G. Hatch\uc2 , Republican of Utah, accused the Labor Department of ''blatantly coddling'' Mr. Shenker for years.\par \par \uc2 Labor officials saw the case as an early test of using Erisa to rid unions of corruption. Seven lawyers were sent to Las Vegas from Washington. For Mr. Shenker, repaying the money would have threatened his financial survival.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Puzder, then 32, and a colleague from the Shenker firm, E. Michael Murphy, left St. Louis for Las Vegas. As he stood to make a point in the trial's opening days, the months of grueling preparation caught up with Mr. Puzder: He promptly collapsed to the floor, fainting in front of judge and jury.\par \par \uc2 After regaining his composure, he attacked government regulators, claiming they had a ''vendetta'' against his boss. ''Some people in the Department of Labor were more concerned with pursuing Shenker than they were with recovering the trust's money,'' Mr. Puzder said, according to The Las Vegas Sun.\par \par \uc2 He argued that Mr. Shenker was financially harmed when the pension fund stopped making payments on a loan extension in 1977. He said the Shenker investments had been well on their way to becoming successful.\par \par \uc2 The federal judge, Roger D. Foley, was unimpressed, at one point saying that the money appeared to have gone down ''a rathole.''\par \par \uc2 The specter of organized crime hung over the trial. Tapes of a 1979 meeting between Mr. Shenker and two mob figures -- Joey (The Clown) Lombardo and Allen Dorfman, a well-known liaison between the mob and Hoffa's \uc2 Teamsters union\uc2  -- revealed Mr. Dorfman complaining that Mr. Shenker had failed to pay him kickbacks on millions in loans that Mr. Shenker had procured from the \uc2 Teamsters\uc2 . Newspapers covering Mr. Lombardo's 1983 sentencing hearing splashed the incriminating transcripts across their pages.\par \par \uc2 The government was determined to reduce the Shenker case to its most basic elements. ''In my opening statement to the jury, I said, 'You may hear a lot from the defense about how complicated this is, but it's simple,''' Mr. Temchine said. '''He borrowed a thousand bucks from each member and promised to give it back, with interest. He didn't.'''\par \par \uc2 The jurors agreed. After the five-month trial, Mr. Shenker was required to repay all the money he had borrowed, plus interest, for a total of $34 million.\par \par \uc2 ''I think he's too good a con man for me to mix with,'' one juror told The Las Vegas Sun. ''I'd be like the pension fund. I'd lose on the deal.''\par \par \uc2 Months later, Mr. Shenker filed for bankruptcy, citing $184 million in obligations. About that time, Mr. Puzder and Mr. Murphy left his firm, which limped along until Mr. Shenker was indicted on bankruptcy and tax fraud charges in 1989. He died later that year.\par \par \uc2 During the bankruptcy case, government lawyers were able to extract $26 million for the pension fund, Mr. Temchine said.\par \par \uc2 At least one time as a lawyer, Mr. Puzder was on the other side of such a case, helping to represent the interests of a police pension fund that had been defrauded by its investment managers. His team argued that the managers were essentially stealing from the widows of police officers.\par \par \uc2 At his labor secretary confirmation hearing, one challenge senators may choose to take up is determining whether Mr. Puzder ultimately favors protecting workers, or executives like himself and his old boss.\par \par \uc2 In a surprising turn, that confirmation hearing could place Mr. Puzder face to face with Mr. Hatch, the senator who once said the Labor Department had been going soft on Mr. Shenker at the same time Mr. Puzder claimed the department had been unfairly tough.\par \par \uc2 Almost 35 years later, Mr. Hatch still sits on that committee. And while he praised Mr. Puzder in December as someone who ''will bring invaluable expertise to the Department of Labor,'' he may well be reminded of the time he scolded a Labor Department official in front of his fellow lawmakers.\par \par \uc2 ''I am still not sure,'' Mr. Hatch said at the time, ''if some of you understand the enormity of the problem that these actions by Mr. Shenker and the Labor Department's poor oversight have caused the 30,000 workers covered by this pension fund.''\par \par \uc2 Andrew Puzder, President Trump's nominee to be labor secretary, once battled federal labor regulators while defending his boss.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Popcorn munching. Soup slurping. Nose sniffling. Or, simply, breathing.\par \par \uc2 Ever wonder why some ordinary sounds drive you crazy? It's called misophonia, a mysterious affliction in which seemingly harmless sounds unleash anger, anxiety and, in some cases, panic attacks in some people.\par \par \uc2 If you're one of them, neuroscientists at \uc2 Newcastle \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  in Britain say they may have found an explanation for what ails you.\par \par \uc2 In a report on the latest study published Thursday in the journal Current Biology, the neuroscientists say that brain scans of misophonia sufferers show that particular sounds, like eating and drinking, cause the part of their brain that processes emotions, the anterior insular cortex, to go into overdrive.\par \par \uc2 That region in sufferers was also connected differently, compared to normal brains, to the amygdala and the hippocampus, areas that are involved in recalling past experiences, said Dr. Sukhbinder Kumar, the lead researcher from the Institute of Neuroscience at \uc2 Newcastle \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''We think that misophonia may be heavily connected to recalling past memories, because people with misophonia have had very bad experiences,'' he said in a phone interview Friday.\par \par \uc2 The research opens up the possibilities of future therapy for those afflicted with misophonia, a term coined by the American scientists Pawel and Margaret Jastreboff in 2001.\par \par \uc2 A survey of nearly 200 misophonia sufferers showed that the average age at which they first became aware of the condition was 12, Dr. Kumar said.\par \par \uc2 ''When they hear these sounds, it's like their attention is completely absorbed by the sounds, and they can't do anything else,'' he said. ''They're triggering a recall.''\par \par \uc2 For the study, the team used an M.R.I. to measure the brain activities of 42 people with and without misophonia while they were listening to a range of noises.\par \par \uc2 The sounds were categorized into neutral ones like rain; unpleasant sounds like a crying baby; and trigger sounds that were mostly linked to eating, chewing, drinking and breathing.\par \par \uc2 When exposed to the noises, those with misophonia showed brain activities different from those without the condition.\par \par \uc2 ''The most dominant reaction is anger and anxiety, not disgust,'' Dr. Kumar said.\par \par \uc2 But why those sounds, and not others, trigger such averse reactions remains a mystery, he said. The exact number of misophonia sufferers in the world is unknown, he said, because it was only recently diagnosed as a condition.\par \par \uc2 The affliction can be so acute in some people that they can't stand living with their own families. Olana Tansley-Hancock, 29, of Kent, England, was just 8 when family meals became a real chore.\par \par \uc2 ''The noise of my family eating forced me to retreat to my own bedroom for meals,'' she told the team at \uc2 Newcastle \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2 . ''I can only describe it as a feeling of wanting to punch people in the face when I heard the noise of them eating.''\par \par \uc2 Dr. Kumar said in a news release,''My hope is to identify the brain signature of the trigger sounds -- those signatures can be used for treatment such as for neuro-feedback for example, where people can self-regulate their reactions by looking at what kind of brain activity is being produced.''\par \par \uc2 But the study's findings will come as some relief to misophonia sufferers and reassure some who question the condition's validity, he added.\par \par \uc2 ''This study demonstrates the critical brain changes as further evidence to convince a skeptical medical community that this is a genuine disorder.''\par \par \uc2 Like the Science Times page on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 . | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020170204ed240006b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 For New Yorkers seeking temporary respite from political \uc2 Twitter\uc2  storms, Carnegie Hall is usually a safe space. And its special festival ''La Serenissima: Music and Arts from the Venetian Republic'' may seem particularly appealing. With a sumptuous red-and-gold Carnival mask adorning the marketing materials, and a program promising liberal amounts of Vivaldi, the festival, which runs through Feb. 21 at Carnegie (and elsewhere), virtually guarantees escape.\par \par \uc2 But culture was never apolitical in Venice, a fiercely independent city sitting at a crossroads of civilization. In fact, the impressively diverse and broad offerings include events with acute contemporary resonance. Consider this your trigger warning.\par \par \uc2 #MuslimBanProtest\par \par \uc2 Vivaldi's only surviving oratorio, ''Juditha triumphans'' -- which the Venice Baroque Orchestra performs on Tuesday -- contains glorious music and a blood-soaked libretto lifted from the Old Testament. It was also written to commemorate (read: gloat over) Venice's victory against the Ottoman Empire at the siege of Corfu in 1716. But unlike most of its Christian neighbors, the Venetian Republic maintained uninterrupted contacts with the Islamic Middle East and maintained trade links even in times of war.\par \par \uc2 [Video: Vivaldi Juditha Thriumphans [selection] Venice Baroque Andrea Marcon Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 On Feb. 17, the vocalist Ahmet Erdogdular and his intimate instrumental ensemble show how Venice, with its trading power, was the link between Turkey and Europe.\par \par \uc2 #Can'tBelieveIStillHavetoProtest\par \par \uc2 The first feminist treatise in Italian was published in Venice in 1600. Written under a pseudonym by a poet who would die in childbirth before seeing the work published, ''The Worth of Women'' takes the form of a literary dialogue, depicting seven Venetian noblewomen puzzling over men's animosity toward their sex and proposing equal access to education as the best tool to fight inequality. The English-language performance, on Feb. 11 at Casa Italiana Zerilli-Marimo at \uc2 New York \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2 , represents the American premiere of this work.\par \par \uc2 [Video: Amor non si fugge Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 And on Feb. 17, Barbara Strozzi is the focus of ''The Secret Lover: Women in 17th-Century Italy,'' a program by the ensemble Tenet. At a time when few women composed, she wrote elegantly sensual music for an academic society founded by her father -- but had to weather constant comments about her looks.\par \par \uc2 #FakeNews\par \par \uc2 Five hundred years before \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , the most feared troll in Italy was Pietro Aretino, a satirist, pornographer, playwright and blackmail artist adept at extorting money and favors from nobles and cardinals with the power of his pen. The Frick Collection, which holds one of Titian's splendid portraits of this ''scourge of princes,'' sheds light on the painter and the libertine in a curator talk on Feb. 15.\par \par \uc2 #BlackLivesMatter\par \par \uc2 Based on a 16th-century story about a Moorish general in the Venetian army, Shakespeare's enduringly unsettling ''Othello'' explores themes of prejudice, loyalty and betrayal. From Wednesday to Feb. 19, Juilliard Drama presents the tragedy in a pared-down version for seven actors, directed by Jonathan Rosenberg.\par \par \uc2 [Video: L'incoronazione di Poppea - Nerone & Seneca Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 #SenateHearings\par \par \uc2 ''I care nothing for the senate and the people,'' the emperor Nero sings in Monteverdi's ''L'incoronazione di Poppea,'' just before raging at the philosopher Seneca, who advises him to be less divisive. (Nero will order Seneca's death in Act II.) As the concluding event of the festival, the Concerto Italiano, under the direction of Rinaldo Alessandrini, shares a concert performance on Feb. 21 of this beguiling opera, first presented in Venice during Carnival 1643, with its seductive score wedded to a memorably cynical, amoral plot.\par \par \uc2 La Serenissima\par \par \uc2 Through Feb. 21 at Carnegie Hall (and elsewhere); 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org/venice.\par \par \uc2 Far left, a painting by Bernardo Strozzi believed to be of the composer Barbara Strozzi, who is the focus of ''The Secret Lover: Women in 17th-Century Italy.'' Left, one of Titian's portraits of Pietro Aretino, a rogue known as a satirist, pornographer, playwright and blackmail artist.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 MONTCLAIR, N.J. -- Sometimes dance fills the eyes with tears, changes our breathing or makes us laugh -- but why? The dancers aren't depicting emotion, yet we find ourselves powerfully moved. On Thursday night at the Alexander Kasser Theater at \uc2 Montclair State \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2 , the dancers of the Richard Alston Dance Company, the London troupe that revisits the New York area about once every two years, caused a gamut of emotion, just by taking us to the heart of dance itself.\par \par \uc2 The Alston style is rich, pliant, full-bodied. Footwork, often fast, brings \u233\'00\'E9lan, wit, brio. Jumps greet chords like bells chiming. Torsos bend eloquently, sometimes effortlessly down to the floor, sometimes gently swaying like a breath. Sometimes a recurrent step makes us hear pattern in the music, as when a quick lift of the foot to the opposite knee matches a suspenseful phrase-ending in the score. Complex sculptural lines register like harmony; rapidly traveling hops make those lines sing.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Alston, who is British, studied for two years at the Merce Cunningham Dance Studio in the 1970s and has worked more recently with New York Theater Ballet and Miami City Ballet. (In March, the students of Juilliard Dance perform his ''Sheer Bravado,'' from 2006.) But his work is best seen with his own dancers. Most of the current group members have been with him several seasons now. They all register as mature people who know who they are; Vidya Patel, Liam Riddick and Ihsaan de Banya are among the most individually striking.\par \par \uc2 Alston style, usually barefoot, is hybrid, deriving both from Cunningham modern dance and ballet. These dancers, this style's meticulous exponents, show why Mr. Alston has been Europe's finest dancemaker since the death of Frederick Ashton in 1988. They demonstrate how he's as tellingly musical as any choreographer alive.\par \par \uc2 All the program's four works, made in 2015-16, are having their American premieres here. ''An Italian in Madrid'' is set to nine bewitching keyboard sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti. A fascinating program note (I read it after seeing the dance) confers a more specific historical meaning on Scarlatti and the dance; but the deeper spell comes from the steps. ''Mazur,'' a male duet, is set to a series of Chopin mazurkas; ''Stronghold,'' an ensemble choreographed by Martin Lawrance (Mr. Alston's rehearsal director) uses recorded music by Julia Wolfe; and finally Mr. Alston's ''Chacony,'' another historically minded creation, has two parts -- one to a composition by Henry Purcell (late 17th century), the other to a 1945 one by Benjamin Britten (mid-20th).\par \par \uc2 Jason Ridgway plays the Chopin items (as he did the Scarlatti) stunningly; the dancers, Mr. Riddick and Nicholas Bodych, suggest Chopin's longing for Poland and intense companionship in exile. Ms. Wolfe's ''Stronghold'' is for eight double basses, with amazingly dramatic sonorities. Mr. Lawrance's choreography catches the drama in the score, even finding, within the harmonies, pulses that the music seems to lack. Purcell's ''Chacony,'' in red baroquelike costumes, is accompanied by the Repast Baroque Ensemble in the orchestra pit; Britten's is played by the Shanghai Quartet behind the dancers, who now return to the stage in pale modern attire.\par \par \uc2 While all these dances richly abound in specific dramas and suggestions, the bigger emotions they prompt derive from the felicities with which moves meet music: poignant, puckish, exuberant, by turns. Each dance makes its own idiom. The courtesies and springing footwork of ''An Italian in Madrid''; the through-the-body manners of ''Mazur'' create Polishness by gestures, pouncing steps, melodic phrasing. In ''Chacony,'' legs and lines sing juicily; Mr. Alston's gift for duets and ensemble finds a marvelously textured, polyphonic richness.\par \par \uc2 Peak Performances\par \par \uc2 Through Sunday at Alexander Kasser Theater at \uc2 Montclair State \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2 , peakperfs.org.\par \par \uc2 Above center, Elly Braund and James Muller, with members of the Richard Alston troupe, in ''Chacony''; left, Vidya Patel and Liam Riddick in ''An Italian in Madrid,'' at the Alexander Kasser Theater at Montclair State \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2 .

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 In the race to find someone -- anyone -- to lash out at over the immigration and travel restrictions ordered by President Trump last Friday, many consumers settled on an odd target: Uber. It had, supposedly, undercut prices for non-Uber taxis just as protesting taxi drivers went back to work. A boycott brigade formed almost immediately.\par \par \uc2 On Sunday, in response to the same executive order on immigration, \uc2 Starbucks\uc2  announced plans to hire 10,000 refugees around the world. Then another boycott action began, started by people who couldn't understand why the company wasn't hiring 10,000 unemployed people in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Both groups had the same goal, whether they were trying to stick it to the president or stick with him: to bring the fight to the companies that may (or may not) do the literal bidding of the new administration. And their weapon was their daily budget.\par \par \uc2 Both actions, however, were not actual boycotts, at least if you ask a purist. ''They are calls for boycotts,'' said Monroe Friedman, the unofficial dean of American boycott studies and an emeritus professor of psychology at Eastern Michigan \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Sustaining a true boycott, he noted, requires more than a hashtag.\par \par \uc2 So what makes a true boycott work? And was it the call for a boycott of Uber that prompted the company's founder, \uc2 Travis Kalanick\uc2 , to quit Mr. Trump's economic advisory council on Thursday?\par \par \uc2 THE TARGET A good boycott starts with picking the right company to put on the defensive. Sometimes, in the desire to make big changes fast, activists take a fire-hose approach.\par \par \uc2 Consider the efforts of the anti-Trump organizers at Grabyourwallet.org. They offer a helpful list of the top 10 companies to boycott. Then, the small-font spreadsheet lists several dozen more, from ''most boycott-able to least.'' Uber was midway down that list.\par \par \uc2 As well intentioned as it may be, this makes for some exhausting reading. It's also exhaustive -- so much so that the organizers felt duty-bound to include a list of entities not being boycotted at this time. It is O.K., for instance, to shop in a bookstore, even if that store sells a book by Mr. Trump.\par \par \uc2 As of Thursday, however, the movement was claiming a scalp: Nordstrom, its top target, said it was not ordering anything from Ivanka Trump and her fashion line this season.\par \par \uc2 THE REASON Why boycott? Outrage tends to fall into two general categories, according to \uc2 Daniel Diermeier\uc2 , who is the provost at the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Chicago\uc2  and wrote about the topic for Harvard Business Review back when he was a business school professor at the Kellogg School of Management at \uc2 Northwestern \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 First, there are the one-sided issues. No one, he said in an interview this week, is on the side of child labor, for instance. These kinds of boycotts tend to draw more supporters and have a greater chance of success.\par \par \uc2 But if you're organizing a boycott around a more polarizing issue -- say, who deserves to come to a country, for how long and for what reasons -- you can expect that for any consumer action, there will be an equal and opposite reaction. The #DeleteUber campaign prompted #BoycottLyft after that company announced a $1 million donation to \uc2 the American Civil Liberties Union\uc2 . At the same time, \uc2 Starbucks\uc2  fans who support the company's outreach to refugees gleefully tweeted about supersizing their Frappuccinos to start this week.\par \par \uc2 VICTORY After Mr. Trump won the election in November, Bill Penzey, the chief executive of Penzeys Spices in Wauwatosa, Wis., wrote a message on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  informing Trump voters that they had ''just committed the biggest act of racism in American history'' in more than 50 years.\par \par \uc2 Boycotts ensued -- but good luck to you if your goal is to change the mind of a guy like that. And if you're going to try, don't send him letters telling him that you're not going to buy his tea anymore. (He doesn't sell it.) And don't give him a reason to disparage your intellect by misspelling ''chef'' as ''chief.''\par \par \uc2 Dan Savage, the columnist, podcaster and co-founder of ''It Gets Better,'' a project that supports lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youths, helped organize a boycott of Stolichnaya in 2013, to protest Russia's treatment of gays and lesbians. He knew he could not change the company's identification with Russia. But by picking on a company strongly associated with a particular type of country, the boycotters could send a message to other nations that their prejudice would not go unnoticed.\par \par \uc2 ''These are failing countries attempting to assume moral superiority over the West,'' Mr. Savage said. ''Whatever else is wrong there, at least they're beating up queers and keeping them from getting married or speaking about themselves publicly.''\par \par \uc2 Separately, in the boycott world, the movement that led to the end of orca breeding at SeaWorld in San Diego is one good example of a well-chosen goal. ''It was something the company could do that was within their control, without ceasing to be who they were,'' said Robert N. Mayer, a professor of family and consumer studies at \uc2 the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Utah\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 EASE Deleting the Uber app from a smartphone is easy enough, especially when Lyft and others offer reasonable substitutes. Caffeination is available everywhere and third-wave cafes offer better coffee than \uc2 Starbucks\uc2  anyhow.\par \par \uc2 Other boycotts may not be so simple, though. For instance, no one makes a chicken sandwich quite like \uc2 Chick-fil-A\uc2 , so people who crave one but dislike the company's historical support of organizations that oppose same-sex marriage are in a pickle. A friend of mine once suggested a solution: gay marriage offsets. Have a sandwich, then take the same amount of money and donate it to, say, the \uc2 Human Rights Campaign\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Diermeier invoked the \uc2 Disney\uc2  example: Good luck talking a child out of a promised trip to its theme parks. (\uc2 Disney\uc2  has, for whatever reason, stayed silent on the travel ban thus far, even though it has this built-in protection of the youth vote.)\par \par \uc2 SIMPLICITY For a boycott to take hold, the precipitating action must be easy to explain. In Uber's case, however, it wasn't. It had sent a tweet noting that the surge pricing it puts in place when demand is high had been lifted. That led to accusations that it was trying to undercut prices of taxi drivers who had just been involved in a work stoppage to protest the president's travel ban.\par \par \uc2 But if the company had left the surge on, the same protesters would have probably accused it of profiteering off the work stoppage. So there was no way for Uber to win, though if it had posted no Twitter message at all it might have escaped notice.\par \par \uc2 Still, this alone is hardly the cause for a boycott. So what's really going on here?\par \par \uc2 In some ways, Uber is getting exactly what it deserves. After all, it has run roughshod over various regulatory bodies for years, blithely waved away insurance concerns and then left town -- as it did in Austin, Tex. -- when the authorities put reasonable rules in place. Even worse, these tactics worked brilliantly. The internet, apparently, means never having to follow the rules.\par \par \uc2 As useful as Uber is, there are likely large numbers of consumers whose loyalty to it is begrudging. So, how many of them deleted the app, perhaps having long wanted to? More than 200,000 according to my colleague Mike Isaac -- enough that Uber had to install a new mechanism to make it easier for people to delete their accounts.\par \par \uc2 We'll probably never know exactly how much the boycott affected Mr. Kalanick's choice to quit Mr. Trump's advisory board, or whether he did so because his employees urged him to. It's possible they could no longer stand the perception that their boss was helping a president whom many of them loathe.\par \par \uc2 According to Mr. Friedman, the boycott dean, a true, successful boycott requires a sustained campaign and plenty of money or time. Consumers who don't have much of either, however, can take heart in one big change that the travel-ban controversy has revealed.\par \par \uc2 For the last week, scores of companies have felt compelled to make statements about a new president and an important piece of policy. Few, if any, of any size offered full-throated support of the ban.\par \par \uc2 It is now more clear than ever that the companies where we spend our billions answer to us. Pummel the ones that you disagree with for their views, or criticize the ones that are too cowardly to side with the man their country elected. But no matter what you feel about what is going on in Washington, isn't it rather nice to see large corporations back on their heels a bit?\par \par \uc2 Twitter: @ronlieber\par \par \uc2 Protesters this week outside Uber's offices in Queens, top, included a coalition of labor, community and immigrant-rights groups, above left.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 STOCKBRIDGE, England -- Alex Lewis had been enjoying pints of Guinness with friends one cold evening when his throat started feeling scratchy and he came down with the flu. Or so he thought.\par \par \uc2 Days later, he was fighting for his life.\par \par \uc2 A mysterious bacterium wormed its way into his body, tearing away at his flesh and turning his skin purplish-black. His lips disintegrated, leaving a gaping hole where his mouth had been.\par \par \uc2 In less than a month, he lost his feet, then his legs and his left arm, physically becoming half the man he used to be. He was unrecognizable to many around him, including his 2-year-old son, who was too scared to hug him.\par \par \uc2 After six months, more than 100 hours of surgery, over 30 skin grafts, the loss of his right arm and so much morphine pumped into him that he mistook a Christmas tree for a ''man-sized cat dressed in a Miss Marple outfit,'' Mr. Lewis was wheeled out of the hospital, a quadruple amputee with part of his shoulder grafted onto his face to fashion a new mouth.\par \par \uc2 The devastating illness, which began three years ago, and the extraordinary response of Mr. Lewis, captivated Britain and turned the laid-back pub owner -- a ''regular bloke,'' as he describes himself -- into a national figure.\par \par \uc2 His illness turned out to be linked to Group A streptococcus, the bacterium that causes strep throat. But in Mr. Lewis's case, the infection penetrated deep into his tissues and organs, resulting in blood poisoning, a life-threatening condition that can cause multiple organ failure.\par \par \uc2 Throughout his ordeal, his mental health and his good humor remained intact, to the point that even his doctors referred to him in medical conferences as an abnormal case.\par \par \uc2 ''The year I lost my limbs was the most brilliant of my life,'' Mr. Lewis, 37, said in an interview, without a trace of irony. ''The man I was isn't necessarily the man I am today -- in a good way, I think.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Lewis sat at his kitchen table one recent morning, hard at work. Dressed in a black T-shirt and black shorts, he was poring over pub floor plans for a client and some fabric cuttings, occasionally tapping away on his iPhone with a stylus gripped in his black metallic prosthetic hand.\par \par \uc2 He tried to silence Siri, Apple's virtual assistant. ''That's what I thought!'' it chirped repeatedly. ''Dreadful, isn't it?'' Mr. Lewis said apologetically. ''Go away.''\par \par \uc2 By all accounts, including his own, this is not how Mr. Lewis usually spent his days before he became ill.\par \par \uc2 ''I was horizontal, really,'' he said half-jokingly, describing his lazing about. ''It was the source of many an argument with Lucy because I wasn't pulling my finger out, really,'' he said, referring to his wife, a no-nonsense type who laughs heartily and who playfully refers him as her ''toy boy.''\par \par \uc2 But after he was finally discharged from the hospital and they began to realize what it would take to get life back to normal, he said, ''the whole laid-back thing had to be shelved.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. Lewis, 43, agreed. ''He's a typical bloke,'' she said, entering the kitchen in a whirlwind after a busy morning at The Greyhound, a nearby pub she owns and runs, and which Mr. Lewis described as ''the most disability-unfriendly pub there is.''\par \par \uc2 She was a dynamo in the days before he became sick, owning and running two pubs, a catering service and a bakery. He, not so much.\par \par \uc2 ''Nothing ever stressed him out. Nothing ever got to him, and that was flipping annoying,'' Mrs. Lewis said, looking at him and breaking into a smile.\par \par \uc2 ''You'd say to him, 'Have you done your paperwork?' He'd say, 'Yeah, left pocket, in-tray; right pocket, out-tray,''' she said, as Mr. Lewis listened and chuckled. ''I'm trying to figure out where all the invoices are, where the paperwork is and wanting to kill him.''\par \par \uc2 But in a strange twist of fate, it was his ''just chilled-out'' attitude, as he referred to it -- a kind of stoicism -- that helped him cope with a shocking transformation.\par \par \uc2 ''If I was a bit of a stress-head, then in that situation you'd lose it, 'cause you're on the precipice of either coping or not,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''You do or you don't. There's no middle ground. Fortunately for me, for whatever reason, mentally, I could cope with it.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. Lewis's tenacity was also instrumental to his recovery, he said.\par \par \uc2 ''If you love someone, I think you just deal with it,'' she said. ''I told him that he had a choice, a choice to either feel sorry for himself, becoming a recluse and hideaway, or he loses his family. He's got to feel like he's bringing something to the party.''\par \par \uc2 The hospital room where he spent half a year, she said, was ''always full of joy.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Lewis, the son of a cartographer in the British Army, had a happy childhood. But he was drinking by age 16, he said, and he skipped college because ''getting drunk at \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2  was not going to be a wise idea for me.''\par \par \uc2 Instead, he went into construction and worked for a bit at the local newspaper. But he soon realized that an office environment was not good for him either, and he started an interior decoration company. He and Mrs. Lewis met in 2009, and after the birth of their son, Sam, he cared for their child while she ran the pubs and bakery.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Lewis enjoyed drinking -- a lot. A typical day involved at least 12 pints of Guinness and two bottles of wine, which he said fell under a pub owner's ''remit'' but he probably took ''a bit too seriously.''\par \par \uc2 To Mrs. Lewis's great relief and to her husband's chagrin, he has had to drastically change such habits.\par \par \uc2 ''I know people will say, 'If you're a big drinker you've got hollow legs,' and I think there's a bit of truth to that,'' Mr. Lewis said.\par \par \uc2 Now that his body weight -- around 84 pounds -- is less than half what it used to be, he can't have more than a few pints. ''I couldn't physically put any more in me,'' he said ruefully. ''You just don't move that much, because you're sat on your arse most of the time.''\par \par \uc2 Staying sober has other benefits, he said, half-seriously. ''A drunk in a wheelchair is not a good thing, not very clever, especially if you've got no arms,'' he said, laughing. ''It's one thing to fall out of a wheelchair when you have arms, but it's another thing when you haven't got arms and, you know, just face plant.''\par \par \uc2 He also has had to rethink his diet. The shoulder, part of which was grafted onto his mouth, is an area that gets fatty quickly, he said. He can tell if he has gained weight just by looking at his face in the mirror, he joked.\par \par \uc2 It took Sam, now 6, six months to agree to hug him. But after the initial shock, Sam was ''quite cool,'' Mr. Lewis recalled.\par \par \uc2 ''He'd say, 'Dad, you look like you've got white chocolate spread all over your face.''' He and Mrs. Lewis explained that with new arms and legs, he would ''become a power ranger,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''He could relate to that.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Lewis set up a trust to help with his rehabilitation costs and pay for wheelchairs, home adjustments and prosthetics. Although the \uc2 National Health Service\uc2  has paid part of his medical expenses and rehabilitation costs, he estimates that he will need nearly $4 million to cover all of his medical costs until he retires.\par \par \uc2 He has started working again, designing interiors for fancy pubs. He is also helping researchers at the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Southampton\uc2  create a national database to help amputees connect with doctors, therapists and suppliers of prosthetics. He speaks in schools and at medical conferences about his experience and resilience.\par \par \uc2 In the meantime, Mr. Lewis has also gone on a kayaking trip to Greenland with amputees from the British military. He is planning a similar trip to South Africa and Namibia this year, but said it would be the last for a while.\par \par \uc2 ''You're not mucking about, doing all this kayaking, you've got to work,'' he recalled his wife telling him. ''I try to get on with it,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 ALEX LEWIS (PHOTOGRAPH BY ANDREW TESTA FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020170204ed240004n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PARIS -- The president of the National Assembly does it. The president of the Senate defends it. Dozens of rank-and-file parliamentarians do it, too. Hiring your spouse, son or sister in France's Parliament is perfectly legal.\par \par \uc2 So, with Fran\u231\'00\'E7ois Fillon, until recently France's leading presidential candidate, in deep trouble for payments of nearly $1 million from the public payroll to his wife and children, many French politicians are asking: What's the big deal?\par \par \uc2 The answer has, belatedly, come roaring back from much of the country's press and public: They just don't get it.\par \par \uc2 ''Penelopegate,'' a scandal named for Mr. Fillon's wife, now threatens to sink the ambitions of a man who little more than a week ago seemed all but certain to become France's next president.\par \par \uc2 But the scandal has done more than add another volatile element to France's presidential campaign. It has also tapped a wellspring of anger in the French electorate and called into question the standard operating procedures of the political class.\par \par \uc2 The outrage has buffeted the establishment, rendering it ever more vulnerable to the same angry populist forces that have already upset politics as usual from Washington to London to Rome.\par \par \uc2 France's gilded political culture of immunity and privilege -- free train and plane tickets, first-class travel, chauffeurs, all in a setting of marble and tapestries -- can no longer be taken for granted, analysts warn.\par \par \uc2 The perception of a political structure run by and for elites who use it to enrich themselves -- sometimes corruptly, but more often perfectly legally -- is helping propel the far-right National Front candidate, Marine Le Pen.\par \par \uc2 ''Nepotism is part of French institutional genetics,'' said Matthieu Caron, an expert on government ethics at the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Valenciennes\uc2 . ''It is unfortunately a 'great' French tradition.''\par \par \uc2 The scandal over Mr. Fillon, he added, is ''making the National Front's day,'' even as Ms. Le Pen's party, too, faces its own no-show employment scandal in the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The difference is that, unlike Mr. Fillon, who has campaigned on a platform of probity and high ethics, Ms. Le Pen has never ''presented herself as the incarnation of republican morality,'' Mr. Caron said.\par \par \uc2 Though a fixture of France's political landscape for over 40 years, the National Front has never held power at the top, and so can position itself outside the establishment.\par \par \uc2 Just how much Mr. Fillon's scandal has improved the Front's chances of toppling the old order in elections this spring is among the most urgent questions facing France and Europe as a whole.\par \par \uc2 The uproar has similarly lifted the hopes of Emmanuel Macron, the former Rothschild banker and economy minister in the Socialist government, who is running an insurgent campaign atop his own newly formed political movement.\par \par \uc2 The immediate problem facing Mr. Fillon from the revelations in The Canard Encha\u238\'00\'EEn\u233\'00\'E9 newspaper is that it is not clear his family members actually worked for the money.\par \par \uc2 France's financial prosecutor is now looking into Mr. Fillon's cozy monetary arrangements with his wife. His parliamentary offices were raided this week, he and his wife, Penelope, were questioned by the investigators, and Mr. Fillon has said he will bow out of the race if he is indicted.\par \par \uc2 But it is telling of the decades of slow rot that have eaten into France's political establishment that virtually no one in line to replace Mr. Fillon is untainted, either.\par \par \uc2 Former Prime Minister Alain Jupp\u233\'00\'E9, defeated by Mr. Fillon in the November primary, was himself convicted in a no-show employment scheme. The runner-up, former President \uc2 Nicolas Sarkozy\uc2 , too, is a subject of multiple financial investigations into alleged improprieties.\par \par \uc2 In France, to be a high-level member of the political class is to enter an exalted state where it appears O.K. to summon a professional shoeshiner to the presidential palace (one of President \uc2 Fran\u231\'00\'E7ois Hollande\uc2 's top aides was forced to resign after that and similar revelations). Lunches with the minister are at least three courses with wine, served by gloved footmen in gilt-paneled chambers hung with tapestries.\par \par \uc2 Which may explain why Mr. Fillon, 62 and also a former prime minister, sounded plaintive this week, defending himself at a Paris trade show.\par \par \uc2 He had been in France's Parliament for 30 years and his wife had been working for him that long, he said. ''If they wanted to get me in trouble over this, they could have done it earlier,'' he complained.\par \par \uc2 But that may be precisely the problem. Mr. Fillon didn't say it, but the implication seemed clear: Over years of fat parliamentary paychecks to his wife, nobody ever raised questions about it.\par \par \uc2 And that, in spite of the fact that she was never seen around the building, did not have a badge or an email address, according to some news reports, and told interviewers over the years she stayed away from her husband's political life.\par \par \uc2 The sense of entitlement, and indeed nepotism, is an inheritance of the country's monarchical culture, political experts and historians say.\par \par \uc2 At least 20 percent, and probably more, of French parliamentarians hire family members. Others hire the wives, children or nephews of colleagues, according to some in Parliament -- a mutual back-scratching that can profit both sides.\par \par \uc2 Inside Parliament's stately marbled chambers this week, some deputies ducked questions about family hiring. Just a few wondered whether moral issues might be involved.\par \par \uc2 ''On the whole, they are not calling into question at all family employment,'' insisted Ren\u233\'00\'E9 Dosi\u232\'00\'E8re, a veteran Socialist deputy who has been associated with ethics reform in Parliament. Even he defended the practice, though he does not do it himself.\par \par \uc2 ''It is legal,'' Mr. Dosi\u232\'00\'E8re mused. ''But is it moral?''\par \par \uc2 That question has not arisen publicly, until now, and for good reason, experts say. Employing family members ''bears witness to a culture of caste or oligarchy that makes it absolutely natural for politicians to profit to the maximum from political power,'' said Jean Garrigues, a leading historian of France's political culture.\par \par \uc2 ''There's a custom, a culture which has become part of French political life, which is a heritage of the monarchy, and which is completely French,'' Mr. Garrigues said. ''There's this idea that, as soon as he is picked, he's free to dispose of public money as he pleases.''\par \par \uc2 That is so despite reforms in 2013 that have raised public expectations for change, something Mr. Fillon appears to have underestimated.\par \par \uc2 Since the ethics reform, members of Parliament have to give the names of their assistants, though not necessarily their relationship to them.\par \par \uc2 ''Fran\u231\'00\'E7ois Fillon is in a new world now,'' said Mr. Caron, the ethics expert. ''There is a demand for transparency.''\par \par \uc2 Some lawmakers were indignant. ''I'm transparent,'' one parliamentarian, Jean-Pierre Gorges, said angrily. ''I tell people, go see my wife and daughter, and you will see how hard they are working.''\par \par \uc2 ''People are mixing everything up,'' said Mr. Gorges, who represents the town of Chartres. ''It's all just to have next to you an employee who is actually much closer to you, and can keep things confidential. You are not just a deputy 9 to 5, you know.''\par \par \uc2 The scandal over Mr. Fillon is unlikely to simply blow over. ''What was tolerated 10 years ago will no longer be tolerated by the French,'' Mr. Garrigues said. ''There's a disjunction between public opinion and the conservatism of the politicians.''\par \par \uc2 That certainly appeared to be borne out in the comments of visitors to the grand old Parliament building this week. As the deputies ducked and scurried in a marble antechamber off the main hall, a visiting group from the rural Loiret d\u233\'00\'E9partement expressed dismay at the affair.\par \par \uc2 ''This just casts a shadow over our political institutions,'' Marc Bouwyn said. ''And we are only now finding out about it.''\par \par \uc2 The presidential candidate Fran\u231\'00\'E7ois Fillon with his wife, Penelope, on Sunday at a rally in Paris.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Snap Inc\uc2 . is aiming to adopt the most shareholder-unfriendly governance in an initial public offering, ever.\par \par \uc2 The Snap regulatory filing was disclosed Thursday, and as previously reported, the company will be issuing out only nonvoting shares in its I.P.O. Snap admits that this is unprecedented, acknowledging, ''We are not aware of any other company that has completed an initial public offering of nonvoting stock on a U.S. stock exchange.''\par \par \uc2 It is different from its predecessors, \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Google\uc2 , which went public with a dual class structure that gave outside shareholders one vote per share and insiders 10 votes per share. In recent years, \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Google\uc2  have revised this structure to add a nonvoting third class of shares to preserve founder control, yet shareholders have had at least some vote even if they couldn't sway the results.\par \par \uc2 Snap has followed the natural evolution of this disenfranchisement, simply eliminating shareholder rights from the get-go. And this is not just about replicating the venture capital model, where founders get control but investors get board seats and veto rights over significant transactions. Here, Snap is not even giving crumbs.\par \par \uc2 For gurus of good corporate governance, this is bad enough, but once you dig into the details of how this nonvoting stock works, it gets much worse for shareholders.\par \par \uc2 Snap has set up three share classes. Class A will be offered to the public. These shares have no voting rights and no hope of ever having voting rights.\par \par \uc2 Class B shares have one vote each and are convertible into Class A stock. These are shares held by prior investors and employees.\par \par \uc2 Then there are the Class C shares, with 10 votes each, which are convertible into Class B stock. These shares are held in equal number by the two Snap co-founders, Evan Spiegel and \uc2 Robert Murphy\uc2 . Specifically, each of them holds 107,943,924 Class C shares. These shares will give the two men complete voting control over Snap.\par \par \uc2 The two founders have a proxy arrangement that transfers voting control to the other if one dies, but it doesn't cover whether they vote their shares together while alive, so presumably they could deadlock. Snap has solved this problem by granting a performance stock award to Mr. Spiegel that will be 3 percent of the company's post-I.P.O. value.\par \par \uc2 This award will be paid out in equal quarterly installments over three years beginning in the third full quarter after the offering. After this, Mr. Spiegel will have total control over Snap and Mr. Murphy will simply be a close second.\par \par \uc2 The fact that the 26-year-old Mr. Spiegel is getting total control of a new company with uncertain prospects but real growth is perhaps cause for alarm, and I wrote as much last week. Who knows what will happen years from now?\par \par \uc2 Snap, which looks a lot like \uc2 Twitter\uc2  did at its I.P.O. stage, could also experience bumps in the road as \uc2 Twitter\uc2  did. In its prospectus, Snap calls itself a camera company, but it really has just one product, Snapchat, which is beloved by the younger crowd for its disappearing photos and texts.\par \par \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Google\uc2  and \uc2 Microsoft\uc2  as well as Amazon have survived because of the ability to provide multiple successful offerings. \uc2 Twitter\uc2  has struggled with just one product -- the platform on which people the world over, including the American president, send 140-character messages called tweets.\par \par \uc2 Whether Mr. Spiegel can expand beyond Snap's disappearing photos and texts is unknown, though the media machine will certainly turn up the hype to 11 trumpeting claims that he is the next \uc2 Steve Jobs\uc2  or \uc2 Mark Zuckerberg\uc2 . Indeed, a recent \uc2 New York Times\uc2  article on Mr. Spiegel described him being ''mature,'' a listener and someone \uc2 Eric Schmidt\uc2  at \uc2 Google\uc2  was talking up as a visionary. This may or may not be pablum, but one has to wonder why it justifies this type of stock given the risks.\par \par \uc2 If things are going well, no one is going to question Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy's control. But if things are bad, then shareholder complaints may be valid, a spur to action. Indeed, control makes sense only if shareholders and the two executives disagree about whether things are going well. But that assumes that shareholders will be irrational or wrong or not know as much as the two men at the helm. The last point may have some validity -- but is it worth complete disenfranchisement, again given that Snap is a very early-stage company and Mr. Spiegel is so young?\par \par \uc2 I suppose it all might be palatable for most diversified investors in exchange for the huge potential upside, except for the last two parts of this scheme. First, in October Snap issued a dividend of one Class A share for each Class C share the two men owned. The result was to allow Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy to sell half their shares without worry of losing control. The company could reload this at any point, issuing out another dividend of Class A shares if the two need more money.\par \par \uc2 Second, the founders' control goes away only if they die or when they hold only 30 percent of the Class C shares they held at the time of the I.P.O. This means that Mr. Spiegel or Mr. Murphy can sell 69 percent of his Class C shares and all of his Class A and B shares and still control the company. And then, they can reload with a second dividend of Class A shares on all of the Class C shares.\par \par \uc2 So, barring unforeseen circumstances, the only way the two founders are ever really going to lose control of Snap is if both die. This raises some interesting possibilities.\par \par \uc2 Hypothetical Scenario 1: Mr. Spiegel is hit by a bus and dies. Mr. Murphy would now have complete control of the company. Yet Mr. Spiegel is supposed to be the visionary executive who justified this voting structure. Or is Mr. Murphy, 28, equally visionary? (Or perhaps it is more likely they are just executing well on the ''disappearing pictures'' concept just as Mark Cuban executed well on ''internet radio'' before selling broadcast.com to \uc2 Yahoo\uc2  in 1999 for billions of dollars.)\par \par \uc2 Hypothetical Scenario 2: At age 30, Mr. Spiegel decides that life as a billionaire married to a supermodel (he's engaged to Miranda Kerr) is more fun spent on an island in the Pacific. He quits his job but still holds Class C shares and wields his power to elect directors and run the company part time.\par \par \uc2 Hypothetical Scenario 3: Mr. Spiegel continues to hold the shares and keep his day job and at age 50 is head of a middling internet company with great potential, but he refuses to give up control, or starts behaving erratically.\par \par \uc2 Potential investors, particularly the big money managers like the BlackRocks of the world, should likely be asking themselves: Is it all worth it, given the risks? I'd note here that \uc2 Google\uc2  has a sunset provision on its dual class shares, while Mr. Zuckerberg is going to give up his ability to control \uc2 Facebook\uc2  if he leaves the company with the issuance of \uc2 Facebook\uc2  nonvoting stock. Does Mr. Spiegel deserve better than that? And remember the other tech titans, Apple, Amazon and \uc2 Microsoft\uc2 , all have one share, one vote.\par \par \uc2 In its prospectus, Snap says its team is ''kind, smart and creative,'' which is kind of like Whitney Houston singing, ''I believe that children are the future.'' And there's a lot of other stuff about growth and big ideas. Snap may be right, and Evan Spiegel truly is the second coming, but this just does not justify the extreme governance given the risk. Instead, it just seems silly, but not in the fun Snapchat sort of way.\par \par \uc2 Steven Davidoff Solomon is a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PARIS -- Michel Onfray, a best-selling French pop philosopher, was sounding pretty upbeat on the phone, even though the title of his latest book is ''Decadence: The Life and Death of the Judeo-Christian Tradition.''\par \par \uc2 His book had just come out, with an impressive press run of 120,000 copies, and was selling briskly in spite of -- or perhaps because of -- its gloomy prognostication. ''If you think today about terrorism, the rise of populism, it was important to put that in perspective,'' Mr. Onfray said recently. His research, he added, ''shows a civilization that had been strong, that had ceased to be so and that's heading toward its end.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Onfray is one of the latest popular authors to join France's booming decline industry, a spate of books and articles (with a handful of TV shows) that explore the country's (and the West's) failings and France's obsession with those failings. (Last year, the word ''d\u233\'00\'E9clinisme,'' or ''declinism,'' entered France's Larousse dictionary.) It's a phenomenon that cuts across the political spectrum and has picked up velocity in recent years by tapping into an anxious national mood. And its loudest voices are intellectuals with platforms in the national news media.\par \par \uc2 Beyond Mr. Onfray's, other books with decline on their minds have appeared in the past few weeks. ''The Returned,'' a best seller by the journalist David Thomson, is an investigative report about French jihadists who've returned home from Syria. ''A Submissive France: Voices of Defiance'' compiles interviews on France's troubled banlieues, or suburbs, overseen by the historian Georges Bensoussan. ''Chronicles of French Denial,'' by the right-leaning economist and historian Nicolas Baverez, is about how France continued its economic decline under President \uc2 Fran\u231\'00\'E7ois Hollande\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 There's also ''An Imaginary Racism'' by the left-leaning philosopher Pascal Bruckner, who was recently cleared of charges of inciting hate speech and argues that fear of being labeled Islamophobic is leading people to self-censor their speech, while in November, the Sciences Po professor Gilles Kepel published ''The Fracture,'' which explores how the radicalization of some young Muslims is tearing apart French society.\par \par \uc2 ''The thing that's very striking now is how pervasive those ideas are,'' said Sudhir Hazareesingh, a professor at Oxford \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  and the author of ''How the French Think.'' ''One of the things characteristic of the present moment is this idea that decline and decadence are not just the preserve of the extreme right.''\par \par \uc2 France's preoccupation with decline has been dated by some scholars to the counter-Enlightenment of the early 19th century, and to the late 1970s and the end of three decades of postwar economic growth by others. Today, different ''declinist'' strains have merged, from Catholic reactionaries to nonreligious thinkers preoccupied by questions of national identity and political corruption.\par \par \uc2 With France's presidential elections looming in April, these often abstract ideas are taking more concrete form as the hard-right National Front and the center-right Republican Party capitalize on sentiments of decline exacerbated by economic malaise and terrorist attacks.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Onfray's ''Decadence'' begins with early Christian history, traverses the French Revolution, then sweeps in the Holocaust, the fall of the Berlin Wall and the 1989 fatwa against Salman Rushdie, which Mr. Onfray says prefigured the 2015 attacks at the French satirical journal \uc2 Charlie Hebdo\uc2 . Though he looks beyond France in his diagnosis, his homeland is central for much of its nearly 600 pages.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Baverez, a lawyer and economist whose ''Chronicles of French Decline'' came out this week and whose ''France in Free Fall'' was a hit in 2003, said he didn't believe in the idea of declinism.\par \par \uc2 ''It's a false concept because it gives the impression that decline is something fated,'' said Mr. Baverez, who has consulted with Fran\u231\'00\'E7ois Fillon, the center-right presidential candidate now caught up in a worsening corruption scandal. ''We have to diagnose denial; we have to accept reality to find solutions.''\par \par \uc2 Even in a country like France, where pleasure is held sacred, decline does seem to be better business than optimism.\par \par \uc2 ''To put it in Manichaean terms: Anything positive doesn't sell, and anything negative sells, as if there were a sort of masochism on the part of some readers,'' said the historian Robert Frank, the author of the 2014 book ''The Fear of Decline: France from 1914 to 2014.''\par \par \uc2 ''The French Suicide,'' by the conservative journalist \u201\'00\'C9ric Zemmour, has sold 510,000 copies since it appeared in 2014; it argues that immigration and feminism have contributed to French decline. The philosopher Alain Finkielkraut's ''The Unhappy Identity,'' about French multiculturalism and its discontents, started a national conversation in 2013, while ''The Time Has Come to Tell What I Have Seen,'' a 2015 political memoir by the politician and writer Philippe de Villiers that's heavy on concern about decay, has been a best seller.\par \par \uc2 The right-wing magazine Valeurs Actuelles, which publishes frequent warnings about the decline of France and the threat of Islamic terrorism, saw its combined print and digital circulation rise to 119,000 copies last year from 86,000 in 2011, according to figures provided by the magazine.\par \par \uc2 The decline boom seems to manifest itself in books and intellectual debate more than in popular culture, although some French television shows have waded into the murky waters. Recent seasons of ''Engrenages,'' or ''Spiral,'' a dark police drama, paint a bleak picture.\par \par \uc2 Not everyone is so pessimistic. ''Yes, the French speak about 'd\u233\'00\'E9clinisme' and are fascinated by decadence, but the most popular political figure in France today is the only one that speaks of hope,'' said the political scientist Dominique Mo\u239\'00\'EFsi, author of ''The Geopolitics of Emotion: How Cultures of Fear, Humiliation, and Hope Are Reshaping the World.''\par \par \uc2 He was referring to Emmanuel Macron, the former economy minister in the current Socialist government who founded his own insurgent party and has been gaining momentum.\par \par \uc2 Even if declinism is going strong, France's birthrate is still among the highest in Europe, and studies have consistently shown the French to be more pessimistic about their country than about their own lives.\par \par \uc2 Some hope the decline industry has peaked. ''I think Trump and Brexit were a kind of electric shock, and something changed,'' said C\u233\'00\'E9cile Daumas, the editor of the Ideas section of the French left-wing daily Lib\u233\'00\'E9ration.\par \par \uc2 She pointed to ''A World History of France,'' by the medieval historian Patrick Boucheron, which seeks to put French history in a broader context and argues that the country has absorbed immigrants for centuries.\par \par \uc2 The challenge is that ''the partisans of decline have formed a vocabulary, a way of speaking that's accessible to the broader public,'' Ms. Daumas said. ''The progressive intellectuals of the left lost their public and are trying to get it back,'' she added. ''It's a real battle.''\par \par \uc2 Michel Onfray is one of the latest popular authors to join France's decline industry. ''If you think today about terrorism, the rise of populism, it was important to put that in perspective,'' he said.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 OTTAWA -- Just over a year after he became prime minister with promises of inclusion, optimism and internationalism, \uc2 Justin Trudeau\uc2  unexpectedly finds himself dealing with a mercurial American president who largely rejects those values.\par \par \uc2 President \uc2 Donald J. Trump\uc2 's personal style and policies are widely disliked by Canadians, including, according to Mr. Trudeau's inner circle, Mr. Trudeau himself. But sometimes gall must be swallowed. Mr. Trudeau swiftly turned the machinery of \uc2 Canada's government\uc2  toward finding a way to get along with Mr. Trump.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trudeau dispatched top advisers, including his principal secretary and onetime college roommate Gerald Butts, to meet with officials in Mr. Trump's inner circle, among them \uc2 Jared Kushner\uc2 , Mr. Trump's son-in-law, and Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist.\par \par \uc2 He recruited political opponents with ties to Washington and Mr. Trump, notably Brian Mulroney, the former Progressive Conservative prime minister who has a house near Mr. Trump's in Palm Beach, Fla., for the cause. Mr. Trudeau promoted Chrystia Freeland, the international trade minister, to minister of foreign affairs and set one priority above all else for her: to ''maintain constructive relations with the United States.''\par \par \uc2 And for further help, he pulled in Andrew Leslie, a Liberal member of Parliament and a retired lieutenant general who received the United States' Legion of Merit for his work with the American military.\par \par \uc2 All the while, Mr. Trudeau has been under pressure at home to be the world's voice against a president who has already insulted or belittled an array of nations. Those Canadians are likely to be disappointed.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trudeau may feel he has little choice. Canada is too closely entwined with its immense neighbor -- economically, militarily, diplomatically and in countless other ways -- to risk the development of serious friction.\par \par \uc2 So while Mr. Trudeau continues to promote his political values to Canadians, he and his cabinet ministers have been careful not to criticize Mr. Trump directly. It is a situation that faces the leaders of other American allies, but none have nearly as much to lose as Canada does -- and none may have a leader as completely opposite to Mr. Trump in manner and belief.\par \par \uc2 ''I am really proud that today Canada is standing for the open society and that we're open to immigration, we're open to refugees, whatever their faith; those are not necessarily popular national values in the world,'' Ms. Freeland said in her corner office in Canada's neo-Gothic Parliament buildings. She added, ''I don't think we would ever want to be sanctimonious, or behave as if we have everything figured out and we're in a position to lecture other people on how to behave.''\par \par \uc2 A case study on how Mr. Trudeau is tiptoeing on the balance beam came after President Trump's orders temporarily barring people from seven Muslim countries and all refugees. It did not play well in Canada, where its open doors to refugees and immigrants are a point of national pride.\par \par \uc2 Unlike some leaders, he avoided direct criticism, instead using \uc2 Twitter\uc2  to tell refugees that they are welcome in Canada ''regardless of your faith.'' But Mr. Trudeau's government resisted calls from lawyers and civil rights groups to bring in all the refugees and other non-Americans who are now shut out of the United States and also to suspend some cross-border immigration agreements.\par \par \uc2 At news conferences, Mr. Trudeau, who describes himself as a feminist, is often asked if Mr. Trump is a misogynist. His response is always similar. ''It is not the job of a Canadian prime minister to opine on the American electoral process,'' Mr. Trudeau said last month in Calgary, Alberta. ''It is the job of the Canadian prime minister to have a constructive working relationship with the president of the United States.''\par \par \uc2 While other prime ministers grappled with American presidents who were unpopular among Canadians, the current situation has few direct parallels. Especially jarring to Canada is the new administration's promise to revamp key components of Canada's economy, like the \uc2 North American Free Trade Agreement\uc2 ; threats to tighten the border; and demand for drastic increases in military spending by allies.\par \par \uc2 ''We're not very well organized for a knife fight in Canada,'' said John Higginbotham, a senior fellow at \uc2 Carleton \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  in Ottawa who served as the second-highest-ranking Canadian diplomat in Washington for six years. ''It's the most worrying thing seen in Canada-U.S. relations during my 35-year career.''\par \par \uc2 It is difficult to overstate the importance of Canada's relationship with the United States. About 2.5 million Canadian jobs are tied directly to trade with the United States, which accounts for about one quarter of Canada's gross domestic product.\par \par \uc2 Unlike many other countries, Canada has received some positive signals from the Trump administration. On Thursday, Ms. Freeland received a call from \uc2 Rex W. Tillerson\uc2  during his first day on the job as secretary of state.\par \par \uc2 ''He told me that the conversation he had with me was the first conversation he had with any foreign official,'' Ms. Freeland said. ''And he said that was very intentional.''\par \par \uc2 Last month Mr. Trudeau's cabinet met with \uc2 Stephen A. Schwarzman\uc2 , the co-founder and chief executive of the Blackstone Group, who heads a group of business leaders advising Mr. Trump on economic issues.\par \par \uc2 After the meeting, Mr. Schwarzman offered soothing words. ''Canada is held in very high regard,'' he said. ''We have balanced trade between the U.S. and Canada, and that's not the kind of situation where you should be worrying.''\par \par \uc2 When Mr. Trump promised to reopen Nafta, which opened up commerce between the United States, Mexico and Canada, Mr. Trudeau said he welcomed any negotiations. Canada, too, has concerns about the trade deal, and Ms. Freeland said that by her count, 11 substantial changes had already been made to Nafta.\par \par \uc2 But if Mr. Trump reopens Nafta to limit the flow of Mexican goods to the United States, Mr. Trudeau's government may have to weigh protecting its trade relationship with the United States against standing up for Mexico's free-trade status -- and implicitly its support of the principle of open commerce.\par \par \uc2 If it comes down to that, Mr. Higginbotham predicts that Canada will abandon Mexico ''in a minute.''\par \par \uc2 The Trudeau government contends its approach is working. Ms. Freeland noted that the government's early efforts to make contact with the Trump administration allowed it to swiftly confirm that dual citizens of Canada and countries blocked by the executive order on immigration would still be able to cross the border.\par \par \uc2 ''Because we had been talking to the administration for some time, there were people who we could call,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 When it comes to dealing with Washington, Canadian prime ministers have a potentially powerful tool unavailable to other leaders, said Michael Bliss, a professor emeritus of history at the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Toronto\uc2 . In addition to the Canadian Embassy in Washington, Ms. Freeland also commands 14 other diplomatic posts and trade missions throughout the United States. They regularly remind governors, mayors and members of Congress that Canada is the largest export market for 38 American states, making free trade in America's best interest as well.\par \par \uc2 ''We carry on relations with Americans in every room in the house,'' Professor Bliss said.\par \par \uc2 When asked if those allies would make a difference when dealing with a novice president whose advisers for the most part reject America's political establishment, Ms. Freeland paused.\par \par \uc2 ''I come from outside traditional politics, too,'' said Ms. Freeland, who has been a journalist and executive at several news organizations in Canada, Europe and the United States. ''We don't know how this new administration is going to operate yet.'' (Ms. Freeland is married to Graham Bowley, a reporter for The New York Times.)\par \par \uc2 What seems more certain is that Mr. Trudeau and his government will be fighting a steady march of cross-border fires. Already it is working to quash proposals to require Canadians to give fingerprints or undergo facial recognition scans every time they enter or leave the United States. With more than 400,000 people crossing that border daily, Canada fears that could cause cross-border travel gridlock and hamper trade.\par \par \uc2 Canadian prime ministers have had rough relations with American presidents in the past. In 1965, Lester B. Pearson, a Liberal and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, called for a suspension of the bombing in Vietnam by the United States in a speech in Philadelphia. The next day, President Lyndon B. Johnson, enraged, is said to have lifted Mr. Pearson by his lapels while shouting a rebuke. Mr. Trudeau's father, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, another Liberal prime minister, had an acrimonious relationship with President Richard M. Nixon.\par \par \uc2 But Professor Bliss said the current situation between the two countries is probably without a direct parallel.\par \par \uc2 ''The Canadian political class is well aware that we're in very serious times,'' he said. ''We can't afford to get it wrong.''\par \par \uc2 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada during a funeral service for victims of a recent mosque shooting in Quebec City, Canada.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Dear Africa, Asia, Antarctica, Australia, Europe, North America and South America:\par \par \uc2 No need to stress.\par \par \uc2 If you've heard anything about a newly discovered ''lost continent'' beneath the Indian Ocean, don't worry too much: Your spots as the continental magnificent seven are secure.\par \par \uc2 It's true that geologists have found something strange under the island of Mauritius, the former British colony east of Madagascar with a population of 1.3 million. They're calling it ''Mauritia.'' But it's not a continent like you all are. As Lewis D. Ashwal, the researcher who made the discovery, put it: ''It's a continent in the geological sense, not in the geographical one.''\par \par \uc2 Mauritia is not something people can see, visit or live on, because it's buried beneath millions of years' worth of volcanic material.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Ashwal, who is a geologist at the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, in South Africa, published the study Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications. But he said it might be better to refer to Mauritia as a continental fragment or microcontinent rather than as a ''lost continent.''\par \par \uc2 So what is Mauritia anyway, and where did it come from?\par \par \uc2 Remember about 200 million years ago when you were going through one of your ''supercontinent'' phases? Africa, South America, Antarctica and Australia had joined together with India and Madagascar to form Gondwana. When that rock band broke up and you all drifted your separate ways, you left a piece behind. You probably didn't notice because it was small. Then about seven million years ago it was blanketed in lava when a volcano in the ocean erupted, creating the island of Mauritius.\par \par \uc2 At least that's what Dr. Ashwal thinks happened. He based his hypothesis on tiny sparkly minerals called zircon that he found on Mauritius. Zircon contains radioactive material that allows geologists to easily date it back billions of years.\par \par \uc2 The island of Mauritius is thought to be only about nine million years old, and the oceanic crust it was thought to be resting on could not possibly be more than about 200 million years old.\par \par \uc2 But when Dr. Ashwal dated the zircon crystals he found on Mauritius, he discovered they were around three billion years old, much older than any oceanic crust and much, much older than Mauritius.\par \par \uc2 ''The results we got were spectacularly surprising, unexpected ones,'' he said. The only way zircon crystals that old could have ended up on the Mauritius Island, he said, is if there were fragments of a continent beneath the island.\par \par \uc2 ''We found continental crust in the middle of oceanic crust where it shouldn't be,'' he said. Dr. Ashwal thinks a volcanic eruption from the Earth's mantle lifted zircon flakes from Mauritia's continental crust and ejected them onto the surface of the Mauritius Island.\par \par \uc2 He said the findings showed that continental breakups, like the one that split Gondwana, are more complicated than previously thought because they can leave big pieces and little pieces all over the planet.\par \par \uc2 But you already knew that continental breakups are complicated. After all, in your billions of years on Earth you've gone through plenty.\par \par \uc2 Like the Science Times page on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 . | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020170204ed240003d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

It embeds deep in the lungs and penetrates into the bloodstream. It is the most damaging element of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/04/sunday-review/life-in-a-toxic-country.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 toxic air in China}}}\uc2 , which has some of the world\u8217\'20\'19s most polluted cities. Most of China\u8217\'20\'19s PM 2.5 comes from coal-fired plants, but a significant portion is generated by vehicles.\par \par \uc2 The study is especially relevant to China in other ways. China has one of the world\u8217\'20\'19s biggest and fastest-growing populations of older adults. Ten percent of its 1.4 billion people are 65 years old or older, according to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.65UP.TO.ZS"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 statistics from the World Bank}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The report on the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Southern California\uc2  website said PM 2.5 enters the body through the nose and can then embed in the brain.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CCells in the brain treat these particles as invaders and react with inflammatory responses, which over the course of time, appear to exacerbate and promote Alzheimer\u8217\'20\'19s disease,\u8221\'20\'1D said Prof. Caleb Finch, one of the authors of the study, according to the report. Professor Finch works at the U.S.C. Leonard Davis School of Gerontology.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAlthough the link between air pollution and Alzheimer\u8217\'20\'19s disease is a new scientific frontier, we now have evidence that air pollution, like tobacco, is dangerous to the aging brain,\u8221\'20\'1D he added.\par \par \uc2 Women with the genetic variant APOE4, which increases the risk of Alzheimer\u8217\'20\'19s disease, were more likely to be affected by high levels of air pollution.\par \par \uc2 A growing number of studies look at the long-term health effects of air pollution. Research done in the 1990s in Los Angeles and published in The New England Journal of Medicine showed that children can suffer permanent lung damage from prolonged exposure to high levels of air pollution.\par \par \uc2 Columbia \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  researchers found that prenatal exposure to air pollution could result in children with greater anxiety, depression and attention-span disorders.\par \par \uc2 In February 2016, a group of scientists from the United States, Canada, China and India said they had found that air pollution {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/12/air-pollution-deaths-india-china"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 caused more than 5.5 million premature deaths}}}\uc2  in 2013. Of those, 1.6 million were in China and 1.4 million in India.\par \par \uc2 Among Chinese, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/23/world/asia/pollution-is-radically-changing-childhood-in-chinas-cities.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 awareness of toxic air has soared}}}\uc2 . Years ago, some prominent Chinese internet personalities began publishing on their microblogs the PM 2.5 concentrations in Beijing that were being reported in real-time by a United States Embassy Twitter account. The attention generated by those posts and a particularly severe bout of toxic air in January 2013 compelled senior Communist Party officials to allow state news organizations to publish many more stories on air pollution.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTFEED020170204ed24002bd\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

In the cool of the morning, the faint scent of manure, the olfactory signature of the Central Valley, hangs in the air.\par \par \uc2 The campus is meant to evoke this rural setting. The crop-colored yellow and gold exterior of Tenaya Hall is set off by corrugated metal accents \u8212\'20\'14 touches reminiscent of the silos and the fields in which so many of the students\u8217\'20\'19 parents work. Tenaya Hall is home to the \uc2 Fiat\uc2  Lux Scholars, a special initiative for first-generation, low-income students that is named for the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of California\u8217\'20\'19s motto, \u8220\'20\'1CLet There Be Light.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The Merced campus opened in 2005; with just 7,000 students (it\u8217\'20\'19s slated to expand by 2020 to 10,000) it does not yet possess the critical mass necessary to support a Gap, a \uc2 Shake Shack\uc2 , a \uc2 Starbucks\uc2  or other college-town amenities. And so it remains of the Valley \u8212\'20\'14 a place of poverty, hit hard by the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/f/foreclosures/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 foreclosure}}}\uc2  crisis, in which an aspiration gap plays out in underperforming schools; only about 13 percent of Merced County residents have a bachelor\u8217\'20\'19s degree.\par \par \uc2 The \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s mission has been to change that equation. About 70 percent of the student body are the first in their families to attend college, and roughly 5 percent are undocumented immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Fiat\uc2  Lux program, established in 2010, is designed to reach these students, the ones who grew up sleeping on living room floors so the bedrooms could be rented out, or who learned how to rub garlic on the bottoms of shoes to ward off snakes while crossing the desert. The idea is to provide a pedagogical and social armature to help them navigate college, especially the pivotal first year that research shows is the strongest predictor of college success.\par \par \uc2 And so as freshmen, 175 of the scholars, 22 of them undocumented, live together on the upper two floors of Tenaya Hall, sharing sparsely decorated rooms reflective of their modest means \u8212\'20\'14 a graduation watch here, a pair of Huaraches there.\par \par \uc2 One of them is Aurora Fabian. On the wall of her bunk bed in Room 351C there is a thumb-tacked quote she takes to heart: \u8220\'20\'1CHappy People Shine Brighter!\u8221\'20\'1D Like her peers who entered the country illegally, Ms. Fabian always tries to shine bright. Her path from Mexico to this campus was hard won. From fifth grade onward, she was out until almost midnight helping her single mother mop, sweep and clean the counters of a bakery before moving on to scrub the tile floors of a nearby Italian restaurant.\par \par \uc2 Through it all, she managed to play high school soccer, run cross-country, work summers and weekends on the Santa Cruz boardwalk. Determined to \u8220\'20\'1Cchange our family history,\u8221\'20\'1D as she puts it, Ms. Fabian won two local scholarships and a coveted spot at the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of California.\par \par \uc2 Collectively, the freshmen in Tenaya Hall are the beacons of a better life. They are the sons and daughters of housekeepers, dishwashers, fast-food cooks, farm laborers, landscapers, garment workers who stitch labels onto clothing and contractors who build swimming pools for affluent homeowners along the coast.\par \par \uc2 Francisco Gavidia in Room 470C fled the violence in El Salvador, sleeping on his grandmother\u8217\'20\'19s dirt floor until he could join his parents, whom he knew only through photos and phone calls. He remembers an incident growing up in East Los Angeles in which his mother, who worked below minimum wage, took him to the E.R. with a bloody nose and was handed a bill for $3,000. \u8220\'20\'1CI felt really bad,\u8221\'20\'1D he said, jiggling his leg as he recalled it. \u8220\'20\'1CIt was just a bloody nose and it was really expensive.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Cruzangel Nava in Room 450G, a political science major, grew up in a part of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/c/coachella_valley_music_and_arts_festival/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Coachella}}}\uc2  light years away from the eponymous music festival. The family lost their two-story home to foreclosure during the recession; Mr. Nava, then in seventh grade, watched in stunned silence as his parents sold off the family\u8217\'20\'19s two cars, his toys, his bike, his game system and his clothes \u8212\'20\'14 his father\u8217\'20\'19s hand-embroidered poncho hanging in his dorm room a cherished exception. \u8220\'20\'1CThey told me they were selling to people who didn\u8217\'20\'19t have things,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 Juan Robles in Room 451A saved up money for college by picking plums alongside his mother, who raised three children by rising at 4:30 a.m. six days a week to work in the fields. A champion debater, Mr. Robles is easy to spot in his jacket, tie and matching silk pocket handkerchief, a sartorial foreshadowing of his career goal to be a legislator crafting \u8220\'20\'1Csmall policies that can make a big difference in someone\u8217\'20\'19s life.\u8221\'20\'1D It\u8217\'20\'19s a difference he knows first hand.\par \par \uc2 Theirs is the #undocupower generation.\par \par \uc2 Many of Tenaya\u8217\'20\'19s undocumented come from so-called mixed-status families, with siblings born in the United States. Karen Gomez, a sophomore who serves as a peer counselor, tried to stifle the envy she felt being left behind during summers while a younger sister traveled to Mexico, including to their grandmother\u8217\'20\'19s funeral. \u8220\'20\'1CShe\u8217\'20\'19d say little ungrateful things about going,\u8221\'20\'1D she said. \u8220\'20\'1CI\u8217\'20\'19d think, \u8216\'20\'18Don\u8217\'20\'19t you realize how lucky you are?\u8217\'20\'19\u8201\'20\'09\u8221\'20\'1D Her sister, now a junior in high school, will be eligible for scholarships that her big sister cannot apply for. A model peer counselor, Ms. Gomez tapes safe sex pamphlets, free condoms and other necessities of college life on her door.\par \par \uc2 Living together as a cohort is meant to foster bonding, and to ease first-generation students into the larger community. It is also an approach strongly associated with student retention; \uc2 Fiat\uc2  Lux Scholars graduate at a higher rate than students with comparable grade-point averages. Those accepted into the program \u8212\'20\'14 there is a waiting list \u8212\'20\'14 attend numerous workshops aimed at what is called procedural knowledge, boning up on study skills and learning how to connect with professors and research opportunities. Several times a semester there are organized lunches with faculty members.\par \par \uc2 Many come to college never having met a professor, notes Tanya Golash-Boza, a sociology professor. \u8220\'20\'1CSome come into my office literally shaking.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Ms. Golash-Boza recently completed a study of 35 undocumented Merced students and found that 22 of their families earned less than $25,000 a year, on par with the average for undocumented students across the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of California\u8217\'20\'19s 10 campuses. Financial pressure is considerable, she said, but because of Merced\u8217\'20\'19s first-generation majority, students feel less isolated. \u8220\'20\'1CThese students understand not being able to afford lunch,\u8221\'20\'1D she said. \u8220\'20\'1CThere\u8217\'20\'19s no shame associated with being poor here.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Charles Nies, the vice chancellor of student affairs, was a first-generation, low-income student himself. The guiding premise, he said, is to \u8220\'20\'1Ccreate an environment where these students matter.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Many in Tenaya Hall grew up having to keep their status a secret, a heavy psychic burden. Madely Martinez, a biology major, remembers hiding from vigilantes after being dropped off in the desert by a blue truck, having to lie flat and still as fire ants crawled all over her. The scene would repeat itself in recurring childhood nightmares. \u8220\'20\'1CI was always afraid,\u8221\'20\'1D she said. \u8220\'20\'1CI thought that even my friends might call the cops.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 For Ms. Martinez, the opportunity to live among smart young people who grew up in similarly fraught circumstances felt like a chrysalis breaking open \u8212\'20\'14 the butterfly the apt symbol of the immigrant rights movement.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CYou don\u8217\'20\'19t have to hide the person you are,\u8221\'20\'1D she explained, sitting amid miscellaneous stuffed turtles and under a poster for the Dance Coalition, the campus performing troupe she belongs to. \u8220\'20\'1CComing here, I realize I\u8217\'20\'19m not the only person who has these fears.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 She is among thousands of students around the country who are attending college largely because of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, known as DACA. The directive, established in 2012 by executive action, provides work authorization and a temporary reprieve from deportation for so-called Dreamers (derived from failed legislation called Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors), who entered the country illegally as children. While undocumented students are ineligible for federal financial aid, including loans, with DACA they can take jobs and graduate teaching assistantships to help defray the cost of their education.\par \par \uc2 The directive is distinct from most immigration policies in placing educational attainment front and center; applicants must be in school or have a high school diploma or equivalent. DACA recipients \u8212\'20\'14 there are more than 750,000 nationally \u8212\'20\'14 tend to be an accomplished bunch: Nearly 15 percent are pursuing a master\u8217\'20\'19s degree or higher, according to a 2016 national survey, and 28 percent are studying STEM, making it the most popular major. Because they can renew their DACA status every two years, many have leveraged their education into careers in their chosen fields.\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22\par \par \uc2 On the morning of Nov. 9, the study lounge on Tenaya\u8217\'20\'19s fourth floor filled with students in their pajamas calling their parents through tears. \u8220\'20\'1CI couldn\u8217\'20\'19t hold my composure,\u8221\'20\'1D recalled Cruzangel Nava. \u8220\'20\'1CI completely broke down.\u8221\'20\'1D Many students, fearing the potential deportation of their parents, headed home to keep them close.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere was a lot of anxiety,\u8221\'20\'1D said Ms. Gomez, the peer counselor. \u8220\'20\'1CPeople wanted to be with their families.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Donald J. Trump\uc2  campaigned on the vow that he would send the undocumented home and terminate DACA, calling the executive action that created it illegal and unconstitutional. On DACA, he has softened his tone. In the president\u8217\'20\'19s first week in office, a spokesman said that Mr. Trump would work with Congress for \u8220\'20\'1Ca long-term solution on that issue,\u8221\'20\'1D and instead focus on deporting those with criminal records.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Trump has taken forceful action against immigrants, closing the borders to refugees and ordering his wall with Mexico. His choice for attorney general, Jeff Sessions of Alabama, has been a consistent and vociferous critic of both illegal and legal immigration, and has tried several times to pass laws abolishing DACA. What the president has in mind for DACA is an open question.\par \par \uc2 Students feel particularly vulnerable because applying for DACA means handing over personal information to the \uc2 United States Citizenship and Immigration Services\uc2 , part of the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 . It is impossible to slough off anti-immigration sentiment and plans for walls when your very own family members are \u8220\'20\'1Cthe illegals.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Alejandro Delgadillo, associate director of the Calvin E. Bright Success Center at Merced, which has a \u8220\'20\'1Csafe space\u8221\'20\'1D for undocumented students, has been trying to calm nerves. The \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2  had sent notices around in December urging DACA students studying abroad to come home well before Jan. 20 to avoid possible detention at the border. It likewise has advised those planning to study abroad to stay put. A \u8220\'20\'1Cknow your rights\u8221\'20\'1D legal workshop is set for early this month.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe\u8217\'20\'19ve always told our students to take advantage of the opportunities they have here at the \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2 ,\u8221\'20\'1D said Mr. Delgadillo, who has worked with unauthorized students for 25 years. \u8220\'20\'1CI can be reassuring,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1CBut for the first time in my professional career, I can\u8217\'20\'19t tell them not to fear.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Diana Pe\u241\'00\'F1a, the U.C. system\u8217\'20\'19s full-time mental health provider for undocumented students, based at Berkeley, said her caseload has nearly doubled since the election. Students have had difficulty sleeping and taking tests or complain of \u8220\'20\'1Cheadaches and stomach aches having to do with the way the body absorbs stress,\u8221\'20\'1D she said. These symptoms, she said, have been exacerbated by discriminatory comments on social media.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe lives of these students are very fragile,\u8221\'20\'1D said Marcelo M. Su\u225\'00\'E1rez-Orozco, dean of the graduate school of education at the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of California at Los Angeles and an author of a national study in 2015 of undocumented undergraduates. They have spent their formative years in a \u8220\'20\'1Clabyrinth of liminality,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1CThey play Little League, they sell lemonade, they join the Boy and Girl Scouts. And then one day they learn: By the way, you\u8217\'20\'19re not an American.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The study found \u8220\'20\'1Cbreathtaking levels of anxiety,\u8221\'20\'1D with clinical stress levels four times higher for young women and seven times higher for young men than the norm. Respondents also reported feeling isolated on campus, uncertain about whom they could trust.\par \par \uc2 DACA has given these goal-oriented young people the opportunity to plan and imagine a future for themselves, Dr. Su\u225\'00\'E1rez-Orozco said. They now find themselves in a \u8220\'20\'1Chorrific Kafka-like situation\u8221\'20\'1D in which they have potentially outed their parents to federal authorities. \u8220\'20\'1CWhat young people crave more than anything else is a sense of belonging,\u8221\'20\'1D he added. \u8220\'20\'1CNow they are going back to a deep crisis of uncertainty. This is a seismic shift.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Francisco Mascorro Montes \u8212\'20\'14 Kiko to his friends \u8212\'20\'14 keeps rosaries from his Mexican grandmother beside his bed in Tenaya Hall, an emblem of his faith. A mechanical engineering major, he is a member of Ingenieros Unidos, a student chapter of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers.

Her appointment was at first controversial because of her enforcement of deportations. But early in her tenure as \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2  president, she started a $5 million fund that pays for advisers like Mr. Delgadillo and resource centers on each campus, where undocumented students can receive academic, career and financial aid advice. Last year, her office allocated $8.4 million, much of it for a universitywide revolving \u8220\'20\'1CDream Loan\u8221\'20\'1D fund.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Napolitano has taken a strong stance defending the civil rights of her system\u8217\'20\'19s roughly 3,800 undocumented students, including stating publicly that the \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2  would not comply with any national registry based on race, religion or national origin. She and heads of the state\u8217\'20\'19s two other public \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2  systems wrote a joint letter to Mr. Trump in support of DACA students.\par \par \uc2 California itself is poised to push back against the Trump administration. The Democratic-led legislature recently retained \uc2 Eric H. Holder Jr\uc2 ., attorney general under President \uc2 Obama\uc2 , to represent them in any legal fights against the new Republican White House. Lawmakers have also pledged to enact legislation that would provide free legal help for immigrants facing deportation proceedings. Unauthorized children now receive Medi-Cal, state public health insurance for low-income residents, and Gov. Jerry Brown signed a bill, awaiting a federal waiver, to allow undocumented immigrants to access the benefits of the Affordable Care Act (should it survive).\par \par \uc2 Nevertheless, educators and immigration lawyers are operating on the assumption that DACA is in jeopardy, even as they keep a watchful eye on the Bridge Act, co-authored by Senators Richard J. Durbin and \uc2 Lindsey Graham\uc2 , a potential lifeline that would extend benefits for three years if DACA is revoked and toughen confidentiality protections.\par \par \uc2 Allison Davenport, a staff lawyer at the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, has been meeting with students at the Dream Success Center at California State \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2 , Fresno. Like many of her colleagues, she is advising first-timers who have yet to apply for DACA to hold off. They risk turning over their personal data with potentially no return. She has been up and down Highway 99, the spine of the Central Valley, conferring on family preparedness plans, including \u8220\'20\'1CWhat will happen if someone is detained?\u8221\'20\'1D and \u8220\'20\'1CWho are your emergency contacts at school?\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Advocates and administrators throughout California say they have observed pronounced signs of unsettledness. At California State, some undocumented students have been asking if they should drop out, others are limiting their time in public spaces; in the Long Beach Community College District, which has a large Cambodian population, students appear to be changing addresses without leaving forwarding information; applications for state financial aid are down by one-third compared with the same period last year. \u8220\'20\'1CParents are afraid the information will not stay within the state,\u8221\'20\'1D said Lupita Cortez Alcal\u225\'00\'E1, the executive director of the California Student Aid Commission.\par \par \uc2 If DACA goes, of course, the ability to work legally goes with it, along with any health insurance an employer might provide and, in some states, driver\u8217\'20\'19s licenses and in-state tuition.\par \par \uc2 Raul Z. Moreno, coordinator of the Dream Outreach Center at California State, Fresno, said that graduates who either didn\u8217\'20\'19t apply or did not qualify for DACA have been creatively cooking up career paths that do not require work authorization \u8212\'20\'14 the undocumented music teacher teaching at-risk students outside of school, the computer scientist who sets up shop repairing and selling cellular phones. \u8220\'20\'1CIt depends on their special talent and academic preparation,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1CUnfortunately, this doesn\u8217\'20\'19t use their full potential. Ideally, the system allows them to be who they want to become.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22\par \par \uc2 Along with hot plates and minifridges, resilience and tenacity are staples of Tenaya Hall. In rooms grouped by sixes down long corridors, young people who spent their winter vacations cutting other peoples\u8217\'20\'19 grass and cleaning other peoples\u8217\'20\'19 floors try hard to study and party, and pretend everything is normal.\par \par \uc2 Rosalba Zavaleta, Aurora Fabian\u8217\'20\'19s roommate in 351C, is confident that whatever happens with DACA, she will be fine; her concern is for her sister Faviola, who grew up with juvenile arthritis, unable to walk. The disease, with which she still struggles, was the impetus for the family\u8217\'20\'19s journey from Mexico. A state program for low-income children with severe medical conditions paid for her surgeries.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI don\u8217\'20\'19t mind washing dishes,\u8221\'20\'1D Ms. Zavaleta said of the prospect of being deported. \u8220\'20\'1CBut what\u8217\'20\'19s going to happen to my sister?\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Cruzangel Nava, who is set on being a district attorney, would turn to farm labor and landscaping. \u8220\'20\'1CThey don\u8217\'20\'19t care who does that work as long as the work gets done,\u8221\'20\'1D he said, adding that being sent back to a country he doesn\u8217\'20\'19t know \u8220\'20\'1Cis like an animal in a cage being put into the wild.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Ms. Gomez, whose mother is a hotel housekeeper, grew up in the cramped confines of farmworker housing. Some days, the family didn\u8217\'20\'19t have enough to eat. On her desk at Merced, she keeps a picture of her high school graduation. She wears a cap and gown with a gold sash (for highest honors), a black sash (for student body president), a blue sash (for secretary of the community service organization) and a gold medal (for achievement in Advanced Placement calculus). \u8220\'20\'1CIt shows me that if I made my parents proud that day, then I can continue when I graduate,\u8221\'20\'1D she said. She goes back to that photograph every single day.\par \par \uc2 Patricia Leigh Brown, a former staff reporter for The Times, writes on culture and community from California.\par \par \uc2 Correction: February 4, 2017, Saturday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article misstated a requirement for DACA recipients.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 THE WEAPON WIZARDSHow Israel Became a High-Tech Military SuperpowerBy Yaakov Katz and Amir BohbotIllustrated. 288 pp. St. Martin\u8217\'20\'19s Press. $27.99.\par \par \uc2 Seventy years ago, the state of Israel was still just a gleam in Zionists\u8217\'20\'19 eyes, and the future state\u8217\'20\'19s military was hardly more than a ragtag group of irregulars, forced to manufacture bullets in a secret facility built underneath a kibbutz. Today, Israel\u8217\'20\'19s military is widely viewed as one of the most effective in the world. Once compelled to arm itself with surplus equipment purchased from more powerful states (and sometimes obtained by stealth), Israel is now one of the world\u8217\'20\'19s six largest arms exporters, earning billions each year through the sale of military equipment to buyers from China and India to Colombia and Russia.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe Weapon Wizards: How Israel Became a High-Tech Military Superpower\u8221\'20\'1D tells the story of this transformation. Written by the Israeli journalists Yaakov Katz and Amir Bohbot, \u8220\'20\'1CThe Weapon Wizards\u8221\'20\'1D offers a lively account of Israel\u8217\'20\'19s evolving military prowess, from the early days of Jewish paramilitaries operating within the British Mandate to Israel\u8217\'20\'19s recent emergence as exporter of 60 percent of the world\u8217\'20\'19s drones. From satellites and missile defense systems to adaptive armor and cyber weapons, Israel has consistently found ways to circumvent or leapfrog financial and technological barriers.\par \par \uc2 But Katz and Bohbot aspire to do more than just offer a journalistic history of the Israeli military\u8217\'20\'19s technological advances: They aim to explain just how the tiny Jewish state managed to become such a military innovator. \u8220\'20\'1CHow did Israel do it?\u8221\'20\'1D Katz and Bohbot ask. \u8220\'20\'1CWhat was the secret to Israel\u8217\'20\'19s success?\u8221\'20\'1D Their answer: brains, pluck and the bracing prospect of imminent annihilation.\par \par \uc2 If \u8220\'20\'1CThe Weapon Wizards\u8221\'20\'1D were a novel, it would be one written by Horatio Alger; if it were a biblical allegory, it would be the story of David and Goliath. Katz and Bohbot highlight several interconnected cultural drivers of Israel\u8217\'20\'19s military innovations. Surrounded by enemies at its inception, Israel came to view itself as a nation that could, as Arieh Herzog, a former head of Israel\u8217\'20\'19s missile defense agency, put it, \u8220\'20\'1Ceither innovate or disappear.\u8221\'20\'1D Meanwhile, \u8220\'20\'1Cthe Jewish tradition of education and scholarship\u8221\'20\'1D led Israel to place a high value on investments in research and development.\par \par \uc2 Today, Israel devotes a higher percentage of its G.D.P. to research and development than any other country, and Katz and Bohbot note that roughly 30 percent of Israeli R&D goes toward military technologies. Israel also invests in its human resources, with numerous specialized educational programs designed to bring top talent into the military and to send soldiers back to school. (Katz and Bohbot quote Shimon Peres: \u8220\'20\'1CWe need to invest in soldiers\u8217\'20\'19 brains, not just their muscles.\u8221\'20\'1D)\par \par \uc2 Israel\u8217\'20\'19s small size, combined with its tradition of universal military service, also helps, by ensuring that there\u8217\'20\'19s rarely more than one degree of separation between military officials, scientists and entrepreneurs; as a result, military needs and challenges are quickly and easily communicated to policy makers, academics and financiers.\par \par \uc2 Finally, Kahn and Bohbot argue, Israel\u8217\'20\'19s culture of informality offers an underappreciated advantage: \u8220\'20\'1CWhat makes Israel unique is the complete lack of structure.\u8221\'20\'1D The absence of \u8220\'20\'1Csocial hierarchy .\u8200\'20\'08.\u8200\'20\'08. helps spur innovation.\u8221\'20\'1D In Israel, junior soldiers feel free to argue with high-ranking officers, and \u8220\'20\'1Ca keen sense of chutzpah\u8221\'20\'1D encourages creativity and protects against groupthink.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe Weapon Wizards\u8221\'20\'1D offers plenty of good stories about fascinating people. There\u8217\'20\'19s the young Shimon Peres, negotiating weapons deals in Havana nightclubs. There\u8217\'20\'19s Danny Shapira, the legendary Israeli pilot testing French Mirages. There\u8217\'20\'19s the Israeli official who helps start Israel\u8217\'20\'19s drone program in the late 1960s by buying remote-control airplanes at a Manhattan toy store and sending them back to Israel in the embassy\u8217\'20\'19s diplomatic pouch.\par \par \uc2 What \u8220\'20\'1CThe Weapon Wizards\u8221\'20\'1D doesn\u8217\'20\'19t offer is any meditation on the political context or implications of Israel\u8217\'20\'19s rise to military superpower status. Katz and Bohbot are cheerleaders, not critics, and there\u8217\'20\'19s little room for introspection in this breathless tale of triumph over adversity. Left largely unmentioned, for instance, is the role of the United States. American security guarantees over the last few decades have kept Israel\u8217\'20\'19s neighbors relatively docile, if not precisely friendly, and nearly a quarter of Israel\u8217\'20\'19s annual defense budget is effectively paid for by the United States. Israel receives more American military aid than every other country in the world combined. A more complete answer to \u8220\'20\'1CHow did Israel do it?\u8221\'20\'1D might be: pluck, brains and billions of dollars of American aid each year.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe Weapon Wizards\u8221\'20\'1D is also largely silent on how Israel uses its military might. Absent is any reflection on the role of the Israeli armed forces in paving the way for the contentious expansion of Jewish settlements into Palestinian territory, for instance, or the Israeli practice of destroying homes occupied by the families of suspected militants, though both have been condemned by the international community.\par \par \uc2 Katz and Bohbot are similarly uninterested in the brave new world Israel is helping to create. Israel, they note with pride, has \u8220\'20\'1Cbecome the first country to master the art of targeted killings,\u8221\'20\'1D which have now become \u8220\'20\'1Cthe global standard in the war on terror.\u8221\'20\'1D Some might consider this a dubious honor. To Katz and Bohbot, however, targeted killings are interesting only because they showcase the combination of \u8220\'20\'1Ccutting-edge technology, high quality intelligence, and Israel\u8217\'20\'19s best and brightest minds.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Israel, Katz and Bohbot note, is \u8220\'20\'1Cchanging the way wars are being fought around the globe.\u8221\'20\'1D Readers will have to decide for themselves if this is something to cheer or mourn.\par \par \uc2 Rosa Brooks is a professor at Georgetown \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  Law Center and the author of \u8220\'20\'1CHow Everything Became War and the Military Became Everything.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 PHOTO: An Israeli Arrow antiballistic missile, in service since 2000.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDEDIVAN MORLEY\par \par \uc2 Through Feb. 18. Bortolami, 520 West 20th Street, Manhattan; 212-727-2050, bortolamigallery.com.\par \par \uc2 Full of colorful intricacies, Ivan Morley's paintings can seem almost demonic in their devotion to labor-intensive techniques, expanses of small shapes and unusual materials and processes, including embroidery, mother-of-pearl, reverse glass and tooled leather. He is at his most overheated in the Bortolami gallery's back space, which displays four earlier paintings that also indicate his affinity for various forms of Americana: horror comics, storybook illustration and 1970s psychedelia.\par \par \uc2 In the front space, Mr. Morley's latest paintings suggest that these tendencies have been tempered, or even outgrown. But who knows? Mr. Morley clearly likes to operate on several fronts at once. These new efforts are sparkling abstractions, the best of which have been made by the artist on an embroidery machine. Lush and gorgeous, their teeming biomorphic shapes are given density by richly colored threads (including metallic) and evoke nonspecific mixes of cartoons, cursive writing and views through microscopes. A dual personality results: The resemblance to tapestries is slightly archaic; the anarchic, abstract profusion seems completely of the moment. It is worth noting that the Abstract Expressionist Clyfford Still is paid homage in ''Logo,'' one of the earlier works here.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Morley provides a tutorial about paintings as objects in four new works using the same composition but rendered in different materials. The embroidered version and the one on stitched-together tooled leather are the most rewarding in completely different ways. The first is opulent; the second is tough, almost battle-ready. Both newly reiterate the concentrated visual life that is essential to painting.\par \par \uc2 ROBERTA SMITH\par \par \uc2 QUENTIN MORRIS\par \par \uc2 Through Feb. 11. Blum & Poe, 19 East 66th Street, Manhattan; 212-249-2249, blumandpoe.com.\par \par \uc2 Inspired by the civil rights movement, Quentin Morris began making all-black paintings and works on paper in 1963 and has continued to do so ever since. The earliest work in this 40-year survey at Blum & Poe, his first solo exhibition in New York, is from 1974. But all of the objects here use some form of black pigment -- ink, spray paint, acrylic, graphite -- applied to canvas, Mylar or found paper.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Morris is hardly the first artist to devote himself to painting in black. An entire subgenre exists of works by Kazimir Malevich, Aleksandr Rodchenko, Mark Rothko, Ad Reinhardt, Robert Rauschenberg, Frank Stella, Marcia Hafif and Wade Guyton, who all used the device to explore the limits of formalism, nihilism or materiality. Like Reinhardt, Mr. Morris (a practicing Buddhist) is also interested in the spiritual aspects of an all-black canvas. He is distinct among these artists, however, in considering -- or at least stating outright -- race as a motivating factor.\par \par \uc2 Rectangles and circles of black fill the galleries at Blum & Poe, pushing back against negative ideas about black as inferior or subordinate, even as a color value. On a formal level, Mr. Morris's works are not as compelling as those by Reinhardt, the undisputed master of the form with his mysterious, self-concocted powdery pigment covering the canvas. But Mr. Morris's works remind us that, despite superficial similarities, no black painting is the same -- an idea that can be extended to culture, society and politics. And it is a pleasure to include another worthy name in the roster of this austere and rigorous genre.\par \par \uc2 MARTHA SCHWENDENER\par \par \uc2 ANTHONY CARO\par \par \uc2 At both Mitchell-Innes & Nash locations in Manhattan: Running through Feb. 4 at 1018 Madison Avenue and Feb. 11 at 534 West 26th Street; 212-744-7400, miandn.com.\par \par \uc2 Throughout sculpture's stripping-down by Minimalism and its scattering in new directions by Post-Minimalism, Anthony Caro (1924-2013) remained a sculptor's sculptor, reshaping his medium's boundaries without forsaking them. He worked figuratively and abstractly in wood, ceramic and bronze but mostly in welded steel or iron, using found, altered or made elements that were either painted or left bare. He operated by intuitive checks and balances, not according to systems. His first works were often more air than metal -- linear and lyrically open. Later came enclosed volumes that intimated elaborate machines, fortified huts or all-terrain vehicles.\par \par \uc2 In the excellent exhibition ''Anthony Caro: First Drawings Last Sculptures,'' which occupies both Mitchell-Innes & Nash locations, the pieces do a little of everything while adding something new: thick slabs of tinted or clear Perspex (acrylic sheets). The sculptures in Chelsea are especially powerful in scale and size. But as you walk around them, viewing their structures from different sides, noting the collusions of metal and plastic, human perception seems scrupulously accounted for.\par \par \uc2 In ''Blue Moon,'' every stainless-steel element remains distinct, recalling the open arrangements of classic Caro. Others, like ''Autumn Rhapsody'' -- where several pieces of yellow Perspex interact marvelously with steel painted a tannish green -- suggest architecture, furniture or perhaps a great organ. In ''Sundown,'' a smoky cloud of Perspex bisects a wonderful mansarded structure in plain steel that also evokes a kiln or forge. And the remarkable ''Terminus,'' which masses together sheets of red Perspex, ancient wood beams, rusted steel and steel whose industrial paint surfaces were both touched up and ground down by the artist, seems both open and closed. It also presents a short history of materials.\par \par \uc2 The folded, bulky figures of adults, children and bulls in a series of vigorous brush-and-ink drawings from the mid-1950s pay homage to Picasso but also presage these last sculptures. They suggest that Caro's final efforts circled back, giving full voice to the formal ideas of his youth.\par \par \uc2 ROBERTA SMITH\par \par \uc2 ROY COLMER\par \par \uc2 Through Feb. 18. Lisson Gallery, 504 West 24th Street, Chelsea; 212-505-6431, lissongallery.com.\par \par \uc2 The standard story of 1970s art tells us that painting and experimental video were two discrete fields -- that the artists who seized upon Portapaks and other new, time-based technologies found paint and canvas too conventional and commercial. This story is complicated, however, by figures like Roy Colmer (1935-2014), who in the early part of the decade made paintings inspired by video feedback and who claimed inspiration from Arshile Gorky and Jackson Pollock as well as Bruce Nauman and Nam June Paik.\par \par \uc2 A show of his early acrylic paintings and later photo grids at Lisson connects the dots with elegance and an invigorating hit of color. Made with spray guns and inspired by what Mr. Colmer called the ''liquid properties'' of video, the paintings interrupt silky, shimmering fields of horizontal stripes with vertical flashes of brightness. They remind you of Barnett Newman's ''zip'' abstractions and of cathode-ray televisions flickering to life.\par \par \uc2 The line down the middle reappears in Mr. Colmer's photo collages, rhythmic repetitions of nondescript architectural elements around New York. (His most famous work, the self-explanatory ''Doors, NYC'' of 1975-76, isn't here, but a portion of it can be seen nearby at the \uc2 Dia Art Foundation\uc2  within a sweeping photo archive, ''Cultural History 1880-1983,'' assembled by his friend Hanne Darboven.) Red subway columns at the Canal Street station, tree trunks along the West Side Highway and white posts at an undisclosed location read as tentative painterly disturbances to the rigidity of the serial photo grid. Mr. Colmer eventually abandoned painting to pursue his conceptual photography, and this show makes you wish he had kept on looking for bridges between these mediums.\par \par \uc2 KAREN ROSENBERG\par \par \uc2 SILKE OTTO-KNAPP\par \par \uc2 Through Feb. 25. Mary Boone Gallery, 541 West 24th Street, Manhattan; 212-752-2929, maryboonegallery.com.\par \par \uc2 Two years ago, the \uc2 Art Gallery of Ontario\uc2  in Toronto presented an assured, challenging midcareer retrospective of the German painter Silke Otto-Knapp, whose landscapes and interior scenes are rendered in whispering shades of gray and silver. Ms. Otto-Knapp's first North American exhibition since then, at Mary Boone Gallery in Chelsea, is smaller but, in its way, quietly rebellious.\par \par \uc2 The artist, a professor at the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of California, Los Angeles, paints unadorned coastal scenes, pared down to pale washes over carbon-dark backgrounds, as well as figures drawn from dance: in this case, the works of the British choreographer Frederick Ashton. She renders the Ashton moves in repeated elementary sequences across multiple canvases, sometimes by the seaside, sometimes in empty space. The dancers' blank faces are topped by strange white coverings: perhaps bathing caps, perhaps wimples.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Otto-Knapp's unorthodox deployment of watercolor on large canvases -- the largest, a luxurious seascape of twin bays in the moonlight, is 20 feet across -- allows her to saturate her grisailles with chromatic variation even as their surfaces remain uncompromisingly flat. Up close, the weave of the canvas ripples through the dancers and the water; moonlit rocks are rendered with coats of light grays that let dark ones beneath bleed through. (The paintings are hung only a few inches off the ground, rather than at eye level, which keeps them from feeling too imposing.)\par \par \uc2 As in Toronto, the landscapes exhibit the greatest intricacy; the half-lit double bays in that 20-foot panorama, or the abraded gray coastline in a smaller landscape, have a nocturnal strangeness that makes them appear both realist and otherworldly. The stick-figure dancers unsettle in their own way, though Ms. Otto-Knapp's quotations of Ashton and other modernist heroes seem, at this point, a crutch she could do without.\par \par \uc2 Though she shares her exiguous palette with other leading figurative painters, notably Luc Tuymans and Marlene Dumas, Ms. Otto-Knapp is a more emotionally complex artist than those reliably gloomy artists. Her paintings' muffled beauty chimes more with the terse poetry of Louise Gl\u252\'00\'FCck, or the pared-down records of Radiohead.\par \par \uc2 JASON FARAGO\par \par \uc2 Correction: February 4, 2017, Saturday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An art review on Friday about an Anthony Caro exhibition, which is at two locations of the Mitchell-Innes & Nash gallery, misstated the closing date of one part of the show. The portion of the show at the gallery's Upper East Side location, at 1018 Madison Avenue, closes today -- not next Saturday, Feb. 11 (The other part, at 534 West 26th Street in Chelsea, runs through Feb. 11.)\par \par \uc2 Left, Ivan Morley's ''A True Tale'' (2016) at Bortolami.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc39}{\*\bkmkend toc39}\b \uc2 A Contentious Call Strains an Alliance\b0\par\par\uc2 By JANE PERLEZ; Michelle Innis and Jacqueline Williams contributed reporting from Sydney, Australia, and Ryan McMorrow from Beijing. \par \uc2 1,581 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 February 2017\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 12\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 BEIJING -- President Trump's combative phone call with Australia's prime minister over a refugee agreement has set off a political storm in that country, one that threatens to weaken support for a seven-decade alliance with the United States just as many Australians say they want closer ties with China.\par \par \uc2 Enthusiasm for the alliance in Australia, one of America's closest partners, which hosts American spy facilities and rotations of American Marines, had already been under pressure from China, with which Australia conducts the most trade. Reports that Mr. Trump had scolded Prime Minister \uc2 Malcolm Turnbull\uc2  on Saturday, before abruptly ending the call, are likely to further undermine confidence in the United States, Australian analysts said.\par \par \uc2 ''Trump is needlessly damaging the deep trust that binds one of America's closest alliances,'' said Professor Rory Medcalf, head of the National Security College at the \uc2 Australian National \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  in Canberra. ''China and those wishing to weaken the strongest alliance in the Pacific will see opportunity in this moment.''\par \par \uc2 In less than two weeks in office, Mr. Trump's actions have strained alliances and alienated potential partners of the United States, and his phone call with Mr. Turnbull seemed to be one more example, this time with a country that has fought on America's side since World War I.\par \par \uc2 His administration's confrontational stance on Iran has undermined liberal voices in that country; his restrictions on immigration from some predominantly Muslim countries have been widely criticized by allies; and his rejection of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal threatens to push countries in the Asia-Pacific region, including Australia, closer to China.\par \par \uc2 Like many countries in the region, Australia depends on the United States for its security but looks to China for its economic well-being, and it does not want to choose definitively between the two as they wage a global contest for power.\par \par \uc2 Experts said the American and Australian militaries were sufficiently intertwined -- the Royal Australian Air Force has flown in Syria, and Australian soldiers have helped train the Iraqi Army -- that the countries' security arrangements would endure. But the trust and confidence underlying the longstanding alliance will be harmed by Mr. Trump's apparent lack of respect, and his remarks will be very costly in the public domain, they said.\par \par \uc2 The phone call on Saturday became contentious after Mr. Turnbull pressed Mr. Trump to honor a deal in which the United States had agreed to take in up to 1,250 refugees being held by Australia at offshore detention centers.\par \par \uc2 Under the terms of the deal, hurriedly worked out by Mr. Turnbull and former President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  in New York last year, Australia would also accept Central American refugees staying in a Costa Rican detention facility.\par \par \uc2 Australia has been harshly criticized for its offshore detention policy, and the issue is politically delicate at home. Many of the refugees it holds, on the Pacific island-nation of Nauru and on the island of Manus in Papua New Guinea, are from Iran and Iraq. Both countries are among the seven whose citizens are barred from entering the United States for at least 90 days under the executive order Mr. Trump signed on Friday.\par \par \uc2 In his conversation with Mr. Turnbull the next day, Mr. Trump said the deal with Australia was going to hurt him politically, according to a senior official in the Trump administration.\par \par \uc2 Late Wednesday, hours after details of the call were reported, Mr. Trump wrote on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  that the agreement was ''dumb.'' He said he would need to ''study'' it, leaving the door open to renege or to accept fewer refugees.\par \par \uc2 The White House press secretary, \uc2 Sean Spicer\uc2 , told reporters in Washington on Thursday that Mr. Trump would allow the deal to proceed as long as the refugees were subjected to ''extreme vetting.'' Mr. Spicer also said Mr. Trump remained ''extremely upset'' over the deal arranged by his predecessor.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Turnbull, whose popularity has been sagging over domestic issues, struggled on Thursday to cast the call in a positive light, fending off demands from the opposition Labor Party that he detail exactly what Mr. Trump had said.\par \par \uc2 Even after Mr. Trump made his remarks on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , Mr. Turnbull insisted in a radio interview that he had ''a clear commitment from the president'' that the resettlement plans would proceed.\par \par \uc2 ''The alliance is absolutely rock solid,'' Mr. Turnbull said. ''It is so strong.''\par \par \uc2 The United States Embassy in Canberra had tried to help Mr. Turnbull with his predicament earlier Thursday, saying the White House had confirmed that the agreement would be honored. But after Mr. Trump wrote about the refugee deal on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , the embassy referred questions about the agreement to the White House.\par \par \uc2 Advice from @USAembassyinOZ on refugee deal going ahead lasted less than 2 hours - 1.15pm until 2.55pm - when @realDonaldTrump tweeted pic.twitter.com/8yQKZ1BbuN -- James Massola (@jamesmassola) February 2, 2017\par \par \uc2 Mr. Turnbull's Liberal Party is the more conservative of Australia's two major parties, and it has been a stalwart supporter of close ties with the United States.\par \par \uc2 The Labor Party has leaned slightly more toward China, but as the debate over relations with Washington has intensified in recent months, former leaders of the party have become outspoken critics of the United States and have argued for shifting toward Beijing.\par \par \uc2 Australian attitudes toward relations with the United States, which have historically been favorable, are now under pressure from China and its trading weight, according to polls. That is largely because the enormous Chinese demand for Australia's resources -- particularly iron ore, natural gas and coal -- has bolstered Australia's economy for more than a decade.\par \par \uc2 Chinese students also contribute substantially to Australian universities and schools, so much so that many of the institutions are dependent on the fees for survival. And under a new trade agreement, Australia is exporting large quantities of wine and meat to China.\par \par \uc2 After Mr. Trump, in office just a few days, scrapped the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- a regional trade pact that the Obama administration had hoped would be an economic counterweight to China -- Mr. Turnbull announced that he would seek to reconstitute the deal without the United States, but possibly including China, another indication of Beijing's clout.\par \par \uc2 A 2016 survey conducted by the public policy group \uc2 Lowy Institute\uc2  asked respondents to identify the country that was more important to Australia; 43 percent chose the United States, and 43 percent China. In 2014, 48 percent had answered the United States, and only 37 percent had chosen China, said \uc2 Sam Roggeveen\uc2 , a senior fellow at the institute.\par \par \uc2 According to the 2016 survey, 45 percent said that Australia should distance itself from the United States if Mr. Trump became president, Mr. Roggeveen said.\par \par \uc2 ''We can assume that number will now rise,'' said Mr. Medcalf, of \uc2 Australian National \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2 . ''This incident will only intensify the damage done by Trump's abandonment of the T.P.P., which would have been a pillar of strategic partnership as well as of trade.''\par \par \uc2 The United States operates signals intelligence and radar facilities in remote corners of Australia that are becoming more important as North Korea's nuclear threat expands, said Peter Jennings, executive director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.\par \par \uc2 ''Australia shares raw and finished intelligence in the closest possible collaboration you can imagine,'' Mr. Jennings said. ''It is extremely high tech. It is something no countries can equal, and it is part of what is known as the Five Eyes intelligence operation. It has created the highest possible level of trusted collaboration between the five countries.''\par \par \uc2 The Five Eyes countries are Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and the United States.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump visited Australia in 2011, expressing a great liking for the country and entering the fray with China. On \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , he called it a ''beautiful country with terrific people who love America.'' Then he added that Australia should ''screw'' China by raising its commodity prices.\par \par \uc2 James Goldrick, a former rear admiral in the Australian Navy who served in Afghanistan, said that if Mr. Trump's current abrasive attitude continued, it would probably make Australia a less publicly cooperative partner of the United States.\par \par \uc2 ''If the Trump administration pursues a less consultative approach, Australia will need to become more public in expressing its opinion on American initiatives that it does not wholly support,'' Mr. Goldrick said.\par \par \uc2 China's role in Asia and North Korea's nuclear efforts are far more important to the United States-Australia alliance than any one telephone call, said \uc2 Peter Hayes\uc2 , an Australian who is the director of the Nautilus Institute, a California-based research institute on security issues. But Mr. Trump's ''ability to create chaos'' has placed those important strategic questions under a ''dark cloud,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 ''The United States has invested five decades in creating that system of alliances, and it is evident Trump is pretty ignorant of it and doesn't care about it, to the extent he knows about it,'' Mr. Hayes said.\par \par \uc2 Follow Jane Perlez on Twitter @JanePerlez .\par \par \uc2 President Trump, top, during his call with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia, above last year. The call became contentious over a plan for the United States to take in 1,250 refugees.

The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA \u8212\'20\'14 In the tower of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.saintmarksphiladelphia.org/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 St. Mark\u8217\'20\'19s Episcopal Church}}}\uc2  here, a circle of men and women were taking turns pulling ropes that moved up and down through holes in the ceiling some 20 feet above them.\par \par \uc2 The ropes were attached to eight bells hanging in a belfry, and the adults were working hard to create the glorious and constantly changing cascade of notes that rang out over Center City Philadelphia.\par \par \uc2 The participants are \u8220\'20\'1Cchange ringers,\u8221\'20\'1D practitioners of an ancient art that first summoned the faithful to church in 12th-century England. Today, the art is kept alive by small bands of devotees, many of them older adults, at various locations around the world, particularly in England.\par \par \uc2 The combination of mental discipline, physical stamina and rigorous teamwork helps to explain the appeal of change ringing to retirees, who typically have the time and experience to become successful ringers, and who are the majority in many ringing groups.\par \par \uc2 For those accustomed to the automated church bells ringing on the hour or at regular intervals, change ringing is a more complex undertaking.\par \par \uc2 The ringers at St. Mark\u8217\'20\'19s and about 6,000 other churches of various denominations around the world create their joyful symphony with a small number of bells \u8212\'20\'14 typically six or eight. The notes remain the same, but the bells are played in a perpetually changing sequence and emphasis, requiring close teamwork, a keen memory and years of practice.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe mental agility and the social side is definitely a big part of it,\u8221\'20\'1D said Bruce Butler, president of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.nagcr.org/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 North American Guild of Change Ringers}}}\uc2 , which was started in 1972.\par \par \uc2 Many ringers are older because \u8220\'20\'1Cthey learned when they were younger, and have stuck with it,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr. Butler added.\par \par \uc2 Many value the friendships they have built over the years with their own groups, and with the ringers who welcome them in other cities or countries.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CYou can walk into a tower anywhere on a practice night and someone will immediately say, \u8216\'20\'18Are you ringing?\u8217\'20\'19\u8221\'20\'1D said Andrew Evans, 65, an Englishman who usually rings at Gloucester Cathedral in England but was recently in Philadelphia for the annual Quarter Peal Weekend held by the Philadelphia Guild of Change Ringers. \u8220\'20\'1CThey will say, \u8216\'20\'18Yes, O.K., what do you want to ring?\u8217\'20\'19 Then you have a ring and go to the pub.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Mr. Evans, a retired research director for a French multinational company, said he used to play golf before he lost the sight in his right eye, and with it, the ability to putt. So he was looking for another social activity that gave him some exercise. He decided to revive his experience of ringing, which began when he was 15 and growing up in an isolated English village where there was not much for a teenager to do besides ring bells in the local church.\par \par \uc2 Ringing a \u8220\'20\'1Cmethod\u8221\'20\'1D \u8212\'20\'14 the name given to a set pattern of notes \u8212\'20\'14 requires the participants to memorize the order in which their bells will sound in relation to all the others, a sequence that will change with each rotation of notes.\par \par \uc2 While each of the methods practiced at St. Mark\u8217\'20\'19s on a recent evening contained a few dozen changes and lasted five to 10 minutes, the longest sequence commonly performed \u8212\'20\'14 known as a \u8220\'20\'1Cpeal\u8221\'20\'1D \u8212\'20\'14 contains 5,040 changes. It takes about three hours to go through the sequences, which can test the mental and physical reserves of the ringers.\par \par \uc2 The Quarter Peal Weekend drew about two dozen ringers who gathered at the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.stmartinec.org/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Church of St. Martin-}}}{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.stmartinec.org/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 in}}}{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.stmartinec.org/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 -the-}}}{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.stmartinec.org/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Fields}}}\uc2  in Philadelphia\u8217\'20\'19s Chestnut Hill neighborhood. Groups of eight rang a series of quarter peals, each of which contained about 1,260 changes and took 40 to 45 minutes to complete.\par \par \uc2 With its advanced methods, the weekend was mostly set up for experienced ringers who wanted to extend themselves in the company of other experts.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhen the local band is not good enough to ring something more complicated, you can get expert ringers who come from other towers where they can\u8217\'20\'19t ring this more complicated method and the combined group can ring it,\u8221\'20\'1D said Donald Trumpler, 86, who began ringing in 1965 but no longer participates because of physical frailty. He and his wife, Elisabeth Trumpler, were among the founders of the North American Guild of Change Ringers.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIf you ring just in your own tower, you get a level of comfort with the bells but you don\u8217\'20\'19t progress beyond that,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr. Trumpler said. \u8220\'20\'1CGetting out of that comfort zone in order to ring heavier bells, lighter bells, bells that don\u8217\'20\'19t go as smoothly as they do at home, that\u8217\'20\'19s a learning experience.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trumpler, a former mathematics professor, said that any novices at the Quarter Peal Weekend would have to be guided by the experts. \u8220\'20\'1CTo ring a complex method, you need at least N-1 expert ringers where N is the number of bells,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 The mathematical nature of change ringing helps to explain why it sometimes attracts those with a scientific bent, said Paul Heinsdorf, a math student at \uc2 Temple \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s interesting because it\u8217\'20\'19s all about permutation groups,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr. Heinsdorf said. \u8220\'20\'1CYou\u8217\'20\'19d be surprised how many people who do this are physicists or mathematicians.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Mr. Heinsdorf began ringing when he was 11 or 12 and stopped when he was 14 but always \u8220\'20\'1Ccame back to the tower.\u8221\'20\'1D He now rings at St. Martin\u8217\'20\'19s once a week during the summer and is trying to build his skills. But he is under no illusions about the amount of work that will take.\par \par \uc2 At 34, Mr. Heinsdorf was one of the youngest ringers at the Quarter Peal Weekend. His participation was especially welcomed by older ringers who fear the art will eventually die out unless younger recruits can be found.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CYou can learn how to ring a bell in a day, but the speed, the precision, the permutations required, I\u8217\'20\'19m not there yet,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1CThis is not something that you can walk into a bell tower and do. This is a technical skill where you are observing everybody else, and you have to know where the pattern goes in the future.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The presence of experienced ringers at the event was evident; only four of the 20 pieces attempted had to be halted because they became irretrievably out of sync, a higher success rate than usual, said Mr. Butler, the main organizer of the event.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThis year, we got more experienced participants than we usually have,\u8221\'20\'1D said Mr. Butler, 67, a retired math teacher who learned his skills in England, where the vast majority of the world\u8217\'20\'19s collections of bells \u8212\'20\'14 or \u8220\'20\'1Crings\u8221\'20\'1D \u8212\'20\'14 used in change ringing can be found. In North America, there are 52 \u8220\'20\'1Crings,\u8221\'20\'1D most of which are in churches, but with several in schools and universities, he said.\par \par \uc2 For Susan Clopper, a retired bookseller from Middletown, Del., the best thing about change ringing is the teamwork that can result in a finely honed performance when everyone is firing on all cylinders.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CEverything comes together and it\u8217\'20\'19s wonderful,\u8221\'20\'1D said Ms. Clopper, 73, who has been ringing since 1976.\par \par \uc2 Memorizing the changes requires a lot of study beforehand, she said, and a lot of concentration during the performance. But once you have mastered the technique of pulling your rope, there is not too much physical strength involved, added Ms. Clopper, who weighs 100 pounds.\par \par \uc2 She usually rings the treble, or smallest bell, but has rung bells weighing up to one ton. \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s mostly technique,\u8221\'20\'1D she said.\par \par \uc2 Ringing has taken her to several cities, including Honolulu, Vancouver and Little Rock, Ark. But the highlight, she said, was ringing a method called \u8220\'20\'1CCambridge Surprise\u8221\'20\'1D at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.gsm.cam.ac.uk/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Great St. Mary\u8217\'20\'19s}}}\uc2  Church in Cambridge, England.\par \par \uc2 Whatever the motivation, many ringers find themselves drawn back to the tower once they have acquired a taste for it, Mr. Heinsdorf said. \u8220\'20\'1CNo matter what you do, you are always going to come back ringing.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 From left: Russell Torrey, Bruce Butler and Alan Morrison at St. Mark\u8217\'20\'19s Episcopal Church in Philadelphia, where they are practicing the ancient art of change ringing.

Suspended there, vertiginous, a young Scottish widow named Caitriona Wallace locks eyes with a fictionalized version of \u201\'00\'C9mile Nouguier, one of the two engineer-architects who had the idea of erecting a 300-meter iron tower on the Champ de Mars as the focal point of the 1889 Universal Exposition. (Although Nouguier and Maurice Koechlin oversaw the tower\u8217\'20\'19s construction, it was their boss, Gustave Eiffel, who purchased the patent and gained the fame.)\par \par \uc2 In the novel, when the future lovers first see each other, Cait\u8217\'20\'19s heart accelerates with \u8220\'20\'1Ca rapid knocking against a solid wall of whalebone and wool.\u8221\'20\'1D Here\u8217\'20\'19s a corset destined for unlacing! Air and iron \u8212\'20\'14 desire and whalebone stays \u8212\'20\'14 govern the story, whose most intriguing moments don\u8217\'20\'19t occur between the standard-issue characters: the constrained lovers; the spoiled rich kids Cait is chaperoning on their world tour; \u201\'00\'C9mile\u8217\'20\'19s jealous, wicked demimondaine mistress; the amoral aristocrat who seduces and discards virgins; and so on. The real drama plays out around the much-maligned tower-in-progress \u8212\'20\'14 its contemporaries thought it a \u8220\'20\'1Cmonstrosity\u8221\'20\'1D \u8212\'20\'14 on the smelly, messy, muddy construction site. As it slowly rises amid \u8220\'20\'1Cthe rubble and the wagon tracks,\u8221\'20\'1D its two and a half million rivets must be perfectly aligned to hold together this fabulous structure whose \u8220\'20\'1Cstrength is in its voids.\u8221\'20\'1D It is \u8220\'20\'1Ca building without a skin.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 PARIS STREET TALES\par \par \uc2 Edited and translated by Helen Constantine\par \par \uc2 248 pp. \uc2 Oxford \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2 , paper, $16.95.\par \par \uc2 As charming and unpredictable as a stroll through Paris, this little book consists of 19 short tales \u8212\'20\'14 five of them in fact prose poems (by Julien Green, Jean Follain and others) \u8212\'20\'14 which take place on specific streets in neighborhoods all over town and sometimes zoom out for a view of the marvelous whole (as in Roland Dorgel\u232\'00\'E8s\u8217\'20\'19s \u8220\'20\'1CRooftop Over the Champs-\u201\'00\'C9lys\u233\'00\'E9es\u8221\'20\'1D).\par \par \uc2 Each text is paired with a black-and-white photograph of a Parisian street scene or another visual image suggested by the narrative. A Manet drawing of a coachman transports us into Maupassant\u8217\'20\'19s \u8220\'20\'1CThe Rendezvous.\u8221\'20\'1D The front page of Le Petit Parisien, Jan. 7, 1912, introduces Colette\u8217\'20\'19s \u8220\'20\'1CHoldup in the Rue Ordener.\u8221\'20\'1D The face of a painted wooden Christ casts a sad glance over Marcel Aym\u233\'00\'E9\u8217\'20\'19s delightfully irreverent \u8220\'20\'1CRue Saint-Sulpice,\u8221\'20\'1D in which a starving pianist, recently jailed for stabbing a violinist, is hired to portray Jesus in a series of \u8220\'20\'1Csacred images\u8221\'20\'1D and ends up walking, very briefly, on the Seine.\par \par \uc2 Zola, Simenon and more-contemporary voices guide our wanderings, expertly translated by Constantine, whose introduction parses the history of Parisian geography. She adds notes, author biographies, a map and a list of resources for further exploration and dedicates the book to the victims of the \u8220\'20\'1Cunspeakable events\u8221\'20\'1D at \uc2 Charlie Hebdo\uc2 , the Bataclan and other venues, and \u8220\'20\'1Cto the brave Parisians who, in spite of the threats of barbarians, daily assert their right to walk in freedom in the streets of their city.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 THE MISTRESS OF PARIS\par \par \uc2 By Catherine Hewitt\par \par \uc2 358 pp. Thomas Dunne/St. Martin\u8217\'20\'19s, $27.99.\par \par \uc2 If you haven\u8217\'20\'19t read \u8220\'20\'1CNana\u8221\'20\'1D \u8212\'20\'14 or, even more so, if you have and are hungering for a less censorious, more deeply researched and respectful biography of the 19th-century French courtesan on whom that novel by Zola is partly based \u8212\'20\'14 this book is for you. In it, Hewitt conducts us up the ladder from grisette to grande horizontale climbed by the self-styled \u8220\'20\'1CComtesse\u8221\'20\'1D Valtesse de la Bigne, born Louise Delabigne, illegitimate and impoverished, in 1848. Hewitt\u8217\'20\'19s occasionally colorless prose is counterbalanced by her social commentary \u8212\'20\'14 on, for example, the pay for different levels of mid-19th-century prostitutes and the \u8220\'20\'1Cembourgeoisement\u8221\'20\'1D of French theater in that era \u8212\'20\'14 and by her protagonist\u8217\'20\'19s labor-intensive irrepressibility.\par \par \uc2 A gorgeous, smart, ambitious, hard-working, steely autodidact and businesswoman whose product was herself, Valtesse would be totally at home in our self-branding society. She loved, as 21st-century America does, things: \u8220\'20\'1CLouis XIV armchairs in cherry-colored silk, luxurious velvet-upholstered seats from the time of Philippe II,\u8221\'20\'1D and of course her \u8220\'20\'1Cthrone,\u8221\'20\'1D \u8220\'20\'1Cthat famous bed which cost\u8200\'20\'08.\u8200\'20\'08.\u8200\'20\'08. just over half a million pounds in modern currency.\u8221\'20\'1D We are taken on exhaustive tours of her \u8220\'20\'1Cpalaces\u8221\'20\'1D in Paris, Ville-d\u8217\'20\'19Avray and Monte Carlo, where she displayed the art she so voraciously collected. She collected men too, and women. Her consumerism, her profession, her politics \u8212\'20\'14 Bonapartist, anti-Dreyfusard, devoutly colonialist \u8212\'20\'14 and the sheer size of her wealth, make her, alas, a woman for our time.\par \par \uc2 PARIS SPRING\par \par \uc2 By James Naughtie\par \par \uc2 322 pp. Overlook, $26.95.\par \par \uc2 April in Paris, 1968, barricades blossoming everywhere. Riot police cast shadows over the young in one another\u8217\'20\'19s arms, the poems posted on the walls: \u8220\'20\'1CBe realistic! Demand the impossible!\u8221\'20\'1D This is the run-up to May \u8217\'20\'1968, when striking French \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2  students, joined by workers, artists and intellectuals, nearly toppled President de Gaulle\u8217\'20\'19s sclerotic right-wing government. It\u8217\'20\'19s fascinating to walk Naughtie\u8217\'20\'19s vividly conjured revolutionary streets, which crawl with diplomats and foreign spies and international reporters like Grace Quincy, a New Yorker writer seen by her colleagues as \u8220\'20\'1Ca distant star in a trade that still cherished glamour and a feeling for the untouchable.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The year 1968 marks the frigid middle of the Cold War, and one spring day, the British spy Will Flemyng is \u8220\'20\'1Cpicked up\u8221\'20\'1D in the Paris M\u233\'00\'E9tro by an East German, who hooks him with the murmured promise/threat \u8220\'20\'1CI can tell you something very interesting about your brother.\u8221\'20\'1D Thus opens the \u8220\'20\'1Cgame\u8221\'20\'1D that provides the structure for this thriller, whose subtext is family. The brother in question shares Will\u8217\'20\'19s profession and his need for concealment. The two remain beloved mysteries to each other and to their older brother, a pensive historian who lives in rural Scotland, beautifully evoked in these pages. The brothers keep secrets even from their boss, the dying spymaster Freddy Craven, a family-member-by-proxy and one of the book\u8217\'20\'19s most winning characters. \u8220\'20\'1CWhat didn\u8217\'20\'19t he know?\u8221\'20\'1D is Craven\u8217\'20\'19s recurring question. And ours.\par \par \uc2 Nancy Kline has translated the poetry of Ren\u233\'00\'E9 Char, Paul \u201\'00\'C9luard, Lorand Gaspar and other modern French writers.

All rights reserved \par \par \uc2 Question:\par \par \uc2 Is retro running (running backward) a good exercise? I read it was popular in Europe.\par \par \uc2 Answer:\par \par \uc2 The answer may depend on what you mean by \u8220\'20\'1Cgood exercise.\u8221\'20\'1D Recent studies show that running backward improves fitness. It may result, though, in falling.\par \par \uc2 The biomechanics of running backward are, unsurprisingly, almost exactly the inverse of the forward version. According to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20719774"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 a 2011 study}}}\uc2 , when runners stride ahead, they typically strike the ground near the back of the foot and roll onto the front, coiling muscles and tendons and, in the process, creating pent-up energy in the tissues that is forcefully released as the foot pushes off.\par \par \uc2 Backward runners do not generate the same kind of pent-up energy, the study found. Instead, to complete each stride, they use more leg muscles than in forward motion and burn about 30 percent more energy to go at the same pace as when running forward.\par \par \uc2 Because it is relatively strenuous, backward running can be effective in building fitness. A {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4273047/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 2014 study}}}\uc2  found that even among walkers, going backward resulted in greater improvements in physical performance than a comparable amount of forward walking.\par \par \uc2 Similarly, for {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26332781"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 a 2016 study}}}\uc2 , experienced runners who traded their normal training program for five weeks of backward running became about 2.5 percent more efficient by the end when running forward. They could now run faster without requiring more oxygen.\par \par \uc2 Backward running also results in less pounding of the knees, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22503882"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 studies show}}}\uc2 , so it is sometimes used to help runners rehabilitate from injuries to that joint.\par \par \uc2 But there is a literal downside. People often trip, stumble or slam into objects and other people while running backward. As {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26021460"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 a 2015 study}}}\uc2  diplomatically concluded, backward running results in \u8220\'20\'1Ca higher magnitude of coordination variability\u8221\'20\'1D than forward running.\par \par \uc2 On balance, though, the benefits can outweigh the risks, says Giovanni Cavagna, an emeritus professor of physiology at the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Milan in Italy, who led the 2011 study.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CBackward running allows training without repetitive pounding,\u8221\'20\'1D he says.\par \par \uc2 Best to try it first on a running track, he suggests, or with a forward-running partner who can point out obstacles.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTB000020170203ed230002t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 IN the fall, I began to research an {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://theintercept.com/2017/01/14/dow-chemical-wants-farmers-to-keep-using-a-pesticide-linked-to-autism-and-adhd/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 article}}}\uc2  that I gave the working title \u8220\'20\'1CThe Last Days of Chlorpyrifos.\u8221\'20\'1D A widely used pesticide, chlorpyrifos affects humans as well as the bugs it kills. Back in the halcyon days before the election, the optimism of the title seemed warranted. After years of study, the \uc2 Environmental Protection Agency\uc2  had announced in October 2015 that it could no longer vouch for the safety of chlorpyrifos on food.\par \par \uc2 The agency had acknowledged for decades that chlorpyrifos can cause acute poisoning and in the early 2000s it had prohibited its use in most home products and reduced the amounts that could be used on some crops. But the 2015 announcement stemmed from the agency\u8217\'20\'19s recognition of mounting evidence that prenatal exposure to chlorpyrifos could have lasting effects on children\u8217\'20\'19s brains.\par \par \uc2 Though the process of re-evaluating the safety of the pesticide had stretched on for years, at long last, chlorpyrifos seemed to be going down. Another report was expected to provide all the ammunition necessary to stop its use on fruits and vegetables, and I was eager to document its demise. For a reporter who covers the environment, this was going to be the rare happy story.\par \par \uc2 The election of President Trump has thrown that outcome \u8212\'20\'14 indeed, the fate of many of the E.P.A.\u8217\'20\'19s public health protections \u8212\'20\'14 into question. On Monday, Mr. Trump signed an executive order {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/01/trumps-regulation-eo/515007/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 requiring federal agencies to scrap two regulations}}}\uc2  for every one they institute on small businesses. In its first week, his administration suspended 30 environmental regulations issued under President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 . And \uc2 Myron Ebell\uc2 , who oversaw the agency\u8217\'20\'19s transition team, suggested recently that the E.P.A.\u8217\'20\'19s staff may soon be reduced by as much as two-thirds.\par \par \uc2 How will the agency\u8217\'20\'19s mission \u8220\'20\'1Cto protect human health and the environment\u8221\'20\'1D fare under this assault? What happens with chlorpyrifos may be our best indication.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI think it\u8217\'20\'19ll be a very early test of their commitment to environmental protection,\u8221\'20\'1D Jim Jones, who oversaw the evaluation of chlorpyrifos as the E.P.A.\u8217\'20\'19s assistant administrator for chemical safety and pollution prevention, told me, not long after he stepped down on Inauguration Day.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Jones described a review process that took more than a dozen government scientists more than five years to complete and involved multiple science advisory panels. After all the questions about chlorpyrifos were addressed, \u8220\'20\'1Cit was very clear to me that we could not meet the required statutory finding of a \u8216\'20\'18reasonable certainty of no harm,\u8217\'20\'19 \u8221\'20\'1D Mr. Jones said.\par \par \uc2 An E.P.A. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=EPA-HQ-OPP-2015-0653-0454"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 report}}}\uc2  that came out right after the election, which was the product of this careful vetting, reflected Mr. Jones\u8217\'20\'19s concern. The revised risk assessment relied on evidence of \u8220\'20\'1Cneurodevelopmental effects in fetuses and children resulting from chlorpyrifos exposure\u8221\'20\'1D and drew on studies showing increased risk of delays in mental development, intelligence loss, attention problems and autism spectrum disorder in children who were exposed to organophosphates, the class of pesticides to which chlorpyrifos belongs. Based on this evidence and feedback from the scientific community, the E.P.A. calculated a new safety threshold for chlorpyrifos and found that in some cases children, who are most vulnerable to its effects, may already be exposed to much more than that amount.\par \par \uc2 The outcome supported by the report, which would amount to a ban on the use of chlorpyrifos on food, would be a reversal of decades of agricultural policy. Some six million pounds of chlorpyrifos are used each year on more than 50 crops in the United States, including corn, soybeans, asparagus, peaches, strawberries, apples, broccoli, onions, walnuts and cranberries. Chlorpyrifos is used in about 100 countries. In an emailed statement, \uc2 Dow AgroSciences\uc2 , the largest producer of chlorpyrifos products in the United States, said that it \u8220\'20\'1Cstrongly disagrees with E.P.A.\u8217\'20\'19s proposal to revoke chlorpyrifos tolerances,\u8221\'20\'1D which it described as based on \u8220\'20\'1Cflawed\u8221\'20\'1D research. The company also noted that \u8220\'20\'1Cauthorized uses of chlorpyrifos products offer wide margins of protection for human health and safety, when used as directed.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The widespread use of chlorpyrifos does point to the fact that it\u8217\'20\'19s not the kind of chemical that harms everyone who comes in contact with it \u8212\'20\'14 or causes them to drop dead on impact. Instead, the research shows increases in the risk of suffering from certain developmental problems that, while less dramatic, are also, alarmingly, enduring.\par \par \uc2 Studies have documented the persistence of symptoms in children for years after they were exposed in utero. Several studies led by Virginia Rauh, a neuro-epidemiologist at Columbia \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s Center for Children\u8217\'20\'19s Environmental Health, found that children in New York City who had been most highly exposed to chlorpyrifos in utero when it was still in widespread use in homes showed persistent developmental effects. Specifically, they showed more A.D.H.D.-type behavior problems at 3 years; deficits in working memory and I.Q. at 7 years; and mild to moderate hand tremor at 11 years, as compared with children with lower exposures.\par \par \uc2 Dow argues that the E.P.A.\u8217\'20\'19s decision \u8220\'20\'1Cappears to be based on a non-replicated epidemiology study.\u8221\'20\'1D But the agency reviewed at least nine other studies besides Rauh\u8217\'20\'19s on the effects of organophosphate exposure and found that all but three \u8220\'20\'1Cidentified associations with neurodevelopmental outcomes.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 While evidence of these neurotoxic effects have been mounting over the past decade, \uc2 Dow AgroSciences\uc2  has been fighting to protect its product. The company urged farmers who use it to write to the E.P.A. about the economic value of chlorpyrifos, among other things. And, according to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&filingID=39AD4718-90E6-4732-A1CA-FF2AB1829625&filingTypeID=51"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 documents}}}\uc2  published on the website of the \uc2 Center for Responsive Politics\uc2 , it also sent a lobbyist to Congress to defend the pesticide.\par \par \uc2 At first, it seemed clear why Dow would choose to go down swinging. Eliminating the profits from sales of the pesticide would amount to a considerable financial loss. There was another reason that \uc2 Dow AgroSciences\uc2  might have wanted to prolong the fight, though \u8212\'20\'14 one that was far from my mind as I began my article. If \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  won the election, his administration might give chlorpyrifos a reprieve.\par \par \uc2 Over the past weeks, it has seemed increasingly likely that Dow might manage to save chlorpyrifos from further regulation. According to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&filingID=1C60FB13-B6AF-45D7-8007-2631B48DD604&filingTypeID=89"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 recently filed lobbying records}}}\uc2 , the \uc2 Dow Chemical Company\uc2 , \uc2 Dow AgroSciences\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19 parent company, contributed $1 million to Mr. Trump\u8217\'20\'19s inaugural committee. The president began his first weekday in office announcing cuts in regulations at a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-01-23/trump-said-to-meet-with-dow-ceo-liveris-labor-leaders-on-monday"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 meeting}}}\uc2  attended by \uc2 Andrew Liveris\uc2 , Dow Chemical\u8217\'20\'19s chief executive, whom Mr. Trump appointed to head an advisory committee on manufacturing.\par \par \uc2 Although a federal court has ruled that the E.P.A. must submit its rule on chlorpyrifos by the end of March, it\u8217\'20\'19s not clear whether the new administration might try to find some way to avoid acting on the science-based recommendations of its own agency. So much affecting environmental protection is unclear, as we saw when Democrats boycotted a vote on the confirmation of Mr. Trump\u8217\'20\'19s pick to head the E.P.A., Scott Pruitt, only to be overridden by Republicans the next day. The president\u8217\'20\'19s tough talk on regulation and his choice of Mr. Pruitt and other fierce opponents of regulation for top cabinet posts suggest the new administration might feel it has to put industry\u8217\'20\'19s claims above all else and allow American farms to continue using chlorpyrifos.\par \par \uc2 But they might consider a different, and much larger, constituency: kids and, more to the point, politically speaking, their parents. Whether they\u8217\'20\'19re Democrats, Republicans, environmentalists or Breitbart enthusiasts, no one wants their children hurt. And if we ignore the evidence on chlorpyrifos \u8211\'20\'13 and turn our backs on environmental regulation \u8212\'20\'14 it\u8217\'20\'19s kids who will suffer.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.facebook.com/nytopinion"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Facebook}}}\uc2  and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://twitter.com/NYTOpinion"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Twitter}}}\uc2  (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/opiniontoday/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Opinion Today newsletter}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Sharon Lerner is an environmental reporter for The Intercept.

One summer, the Gerson family joins a group on a guided white-water rafting trip on a part of the Green River that runs near the border between Utah and Colorado \u8212\'20\'14 having never tried the sport. On the afternoon of the first day, they arrive at a section of the river whose ominous name was given by a 19th-century explorer to warn travelers: Disaster Falls. In spite of his inexperience, Gerson decides to take his 8-year-old son, Owen, over the falls in a light inflatable rubber kayak known, in rafting parlance, as a ducky. The guides have described it as less stable and more responsive to the churning waters, which Gerson thinks will be more exciting for Owen than the raft carrying his wife, Alison, and their older son. In an instant of inattention, Gerson allows the ducky to go too close to the rocks and it flips. The current sucks them under; Gerson breaks free, but Owen is caught in the rocks and drowns.\par \par \uc2 By the time Owen\u8217\'20\'19s body is found, it is too late in the day to get out of the wilderness. In that long sleepless night in the tent Alison declares, \u8220\'20\'1CWe cannot revisit the past.\u8221\'20\'1D To a remarkable extent the couple seem to stick to the \u8220\'20\'1Cpact\u8221\'20\'1D they \u8220\'20\'1Csealed in the tent.\u8221\'20\'1D When, months later, Alison confesses one morning, \u8220\'20\'1CSometimes I go back to the river,\u8221\'20\'1D she does so in a whisper and immediately apologies. The pact, Gerson explains, permits them to express general sadness with each other, but not to \u8220\'20\'1Cwonder out loud whether we would make it, or say things like my life is finished\u8221\'20\'1D or to \u8220\'20\'1Cdrag the other, unprepared, back to the accident.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 While the pact may be adaptive for them as a family, it proves an impossible commandment for a memoir. The book seems muffled by a protective code of silence that keeps Gerson from fully examining the agonizing issue of responsibility at the heart of the book and writing about what it means to have caused the death of a child he loved so much. Gerson is a historian \u8212\'20\'14 a professor of French studies at \uc2 New York \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  and the author of several academic books. He is adept at conveying himself as a character struggling with grief, plunging the reader into the intimate eddies of emotion and his own, Alison\u8217\'20\'19s and their surviving son\u8217\'20\'19s attempts to create a new order as a family of three. He is a compelling and sympathetic character. But the book would benefit from more of Gerson\u8217\'20\'19s historian self: the writer who analyzes the material and tells us how he ultimately comes to regard his conflicted emotions. He writes movingly about his feelings of guilt and failure \u8212\'20\'14 his piercing belated insight that, above all else, \u8220\'20\'1Cthe benchmark for a good father\u8221\'20\'1D is ensuring his children survive to adulthood. But he also repeatedly quotes others assuring him that he is \u8220\'20\'1Cin no way responsible,\u8221\'20\'1D and it remains frustratingly unclear how he ultimately judges himself.\par \par \uc2 In one sense, the accident is clearly his fault \u8212\'20\'14 the result of a risk he took \u8212\'20\'14 as well as the fault of the guides who assured him it would be O.K. But in a deeper sense the suffering, of course, is undeserved and, as he says, the death is cruelly \u8220\'20\'1Cunfair.\u8221\'20\'1D The nature of tragedy is that one ordinary human lapse of judgment can lead to untold suffering. The Gersons sue the guiding company on the grounds that although they signed the releases, they did not understand the risks. The rafting company\u8217\'20\'19s director testifies that the company does not \u8220\'20\'1Ctry to hold out to passengers that this is a safe trip.\u8221\'20\'1D Indeed, Gerson himself had had a deep sense of foreboding looking at Disaster Falls that day \u8212\'20\'14 the sense that \u8220\'20\'1Ca churned-up demon of destruction and terror\u8221\'20\'1D lurked beneath the waters. Yet he allowed himself to trust the guides\u8217\'20\'19 assurances over his own instincts.\par \par \uc2 There is a certain kind of parent who is drawn to high-risk sports, and one might assume Gerson was a daredevil. Poignantly, the truth seems to have been the opposite: That day at the falls can be understood as a counterphobic attempt by the professor to overcome his own cautious temperament as well as his son\u8217\'20\'19s. Gerson writes that he came close to saying no to the rubber ducky that day at Disaster Falls, when both he and Owen were frightened, but he felt that \u8220\'20\'1Csaying no would tell Owen to choose a safe and protected existence over an exposed and passionate one.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The book is written in a fragmentary form with snippets of reflection or dialogue, moving toward and away from the day of the accident. Gerson is a gifted writer, and most of the prose is piercing, precise and graceful. Yet there are moments the writing seems odd, awkward or stilted, veering into grand, vaguely poetic metaphors that don\u8217\'20\'19t hold up, perhaps as if they might be translated from Gerson\u8217\'20\'19s native French. (For example, \u8220\'20\'1CPerhaps Owen uttered these words because his throat had opened so wide that it took in the crisp air and let out the dread and exhilaration that stand as the impossible horizon of a life that already seemed short and long at the same time.\u8221\'20\'1D) The most powerful writing is the most direct, such as when Gerson is sucked under the current and thinks he may die: \u8220\'20\'1CThe possibility of dying filled me with disbelief: Death in these circumstances? Why are we even here? And if I am about to die, then what is happening to Owen?\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The one part of the book I found difficult to reread was written the most straightforwardly \u8212\'20\'14 a litany of regrets Alison writes to her son after he dies: \u8220\'20\'1CI am sorry you are gone. I\u8217\'20\'19m sorry we couldn\u8217\'20\'19t save you, find you, protect you.\u8200\'20\'08.\u8200\'20\'08.\u8200\'20\'08. I am sorry you will never marry, have sex, kiss a girl.\u8200\'20\'08.\u8200\'20\'08.\u8200\'20\'08. I am sorry your front teeth didn\u8217\'20\'19t come in before you died.\u8200\'20\'08.\u8200\'20\'08.\u8200\'20\'08. I\u8217\'20\'19m sorry my life is what it is \u8212\'20\'14 without you.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Alison is increasingly convinced that she can communicate with Owen \u8212\'20\'14 that when she goes for a walk in the woods near their house, he is sending her signals in heart-shaped rocks she collects or rabbits that cross her path (she used to call him Bunny). Gerson\u8217\'20\'19s \u8220\'20\'1Cinternal battles with magical thinking\u8221\'20\'1D make him \u8220\'20\'1Cresent Alison\u8217\'20\'19s certainty when it came to Owen\u8217\'20\'19s presence,\u8221\'20\'1D and he fears she is moving closer to Owen and farther from him, disappearing into a psychic realm where he cannot follow. But ultimately, he aligns himself with his wife and adopts her conviction that Owen\u8217\'20\'19s death was in some way cosmically prefigured. Gerson points to several incidents before the accident: a day when he went into Owen\u8217\'20\'19s room and found himself imagining that Owen was dead and a night that Alison woke with a \u8220\'20\'1Cterrifying presentiment.\u8221\'20\'1D A few months after the accident a silver frame around a picture of Owen went inexplicably dark for half a second.\par \par \uc2 People related that Owen had confided to them \u8220\'20\'1Cthat even though he looked like other children, he could see things they could not,\u8221\'20\'1D such as red flashes and odd shapes on the carpet and walls, and that he was accompanied by \u8220\'20\'1Ca benevolent force\u8221\'20\'1D that he could see from the corner of his eye. Perhaps Owen\u8217\'20\'19s struggles with insomnia were because \u8220\'20\'1Che was confronting these flashes and shapes along with the prospect of final solitude,\u8221\'20\'1D Gerson decides and \u8220\'20\'1Chad some acquaintance with death.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Alison seeks out a medium who tells her that she has communicated with Owen and that he wants his parents to know the accident was not their fault. He knows the medium may be telling them what they want to hear, but finds \u8220\'20\'1Ccomfort in the story, forceful and necessary\u8221\'20\'1D and decides that \u8220\'20\'1Cwhether events on the river had taken place that way or not hardly mattered at that moment\u8221\'20\'1D because \u8220\'20\'1CAlison and I could choose to make this story our own; we could compose it together.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 What are we to make of this \u8212\'20\'14 an idea that seems to erase the tragedy in all of its wrongness and frame it, somehow, as part of Owen\u8217\'20\'19s nature and therefore, in some sense, meant to be? Certainly, bereaved parents should embrace any story that gets them through the day. But it\u8217\'20\'19s not clear how Gerson regards this story \u8212\'20\'14 as a convenient fiction or as his own assessment? Although there is much to admire in it, \u8220\'20\'1CDisaster Falls\u8221\'20\'1D is the rare book that would have been better longer, with these issues thoroughly explored. The book reads more like journal entries or notes toward a book rather than a finished project. But it is also a testament to its power that we long to know more and wish that Gerson had put it in a drawer until he was ready to fully examine the unbearable.\par \par \uc2 Melanie Thernstrom is the author, most recently, of \u8220\'20\'1CThe Pain Chronicles.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Anna Parini \par \par \uc2 Document NYTFEED020170203ed2300566\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Bannon.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIf \uc2 U.C.

Heller, the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of San Francisco provost and a professor of education.\par \par \uc2 To do so would require an act of Congress, an unlikely outcome but one that could not be ruled out.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI think we have to take it seriously,\u8221\'20\'1D said \uc2 David A.

The event was canceled by the police before it could start Wednesday night only after the security situation got out of hand.\par \par \uc2 Most demonstrators assembled peaceably. But dozens of masked protesters ran riot, setting fires, smashing windows and leaving multiple people injured.\par \par \uc2 Still, Mr. Trump\u8217\'20\'19s Twitter post seemed to cast the \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2  as a whole as complicit in the violence.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s just factually incorrect,\u8221\'20\'1D Dr. Heller said. \u8220\'20\'1CThat\u8217\'20\'19s the sad thing.

And the film, a best picture Oscar nominee and box office hit, landed an upset victory for best ensemble at the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/29/movies/sag-awards-speeches-trump.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Screen Actors Guild Awards}}}\uc2  on Sunday. To top it off, Ms. Spencer, 46, was named {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/01/hasty-pudding-honors-octavia-spencer/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Woman of the Year}}}\uc2  by \uc2 Harvard \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s Hasty Pudding Theatricals.\par \par \uc2 She chatted with the Bagger a few days after the SAG Awards about her deep pride in the film, frustration with people who doubt the tale it tells is true, and her plans for keeping sane amid tumultuous times. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.\par \par \uc2 Congrats on the SAG win. Was it a surprise?\par \par \uc2 It was a surprise. It was also deeply felt. The women that we portrayed \u8212\'20\'14 Dorothy Vaughan, Katherine Johnson and Mary Jackson \u8212\'20\'14 are being recognized by our society 50 years later. The win means we did our jobs and conveyed these women as they truly and deeply were.\par \par \uc2 You\u8217\'20\'19ve been talking about this film for nearly a year now. How do you keep it fresh?\par \par \uc2 It will always be fresh. All I am is an actor. These are people contributed to space. There are a few idiots out there {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.vdare.com/articles/hyped-figures-john-glenn-and-the-pc-myth-of-katherine-johnson-unsung-black-women-were-not-what-got-us-to-the-moon"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 who think it didn\u8217\'20\'19t happen}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Really? Who?\par \par \uc2 It\u8217\'20\'19s the Trumpites who think people are bending the truth. It\u8217\'20\'19s mind-boggling to me that we have totally regressed to this whole labeling and colorism and just ridiculous racist bigotry that is percolating in society right now.\par \par \uc2 Do you think this movies is encouraging little girls or women to go into STEM jobs?\par \par \uc2 Oh, absolutely it\u8217\'20\'19s helping. I want little girls \u8212\'20\'14 black, white, Asian, Latina \u8212\'20\'14 to know that they have something to contribute. I was so inspired by the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/movies/a8662502/little-girls-dressing-up-hidden-figures-poster/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 little girls dressing up}}}\uc2  as the women we represent.\par \par \uc2 Your \u8220\'20\'1CHidden Figures\u8221\'20\'1D co-star Taraji P. Henson said in the SAG acceptance speech that this film is about women who didn\u8217\'20\'19t complain despite all the hurdles they faced in their time. They put their head down and worked. Do you feel like that is the path toward progress?\par \par \uc2 I think there\u8217\'20\'19s a healthy medium. I think you have to keep eye on what\u8217\'20\'19s going on. But the most important thing is people need to call their reps, and also give money to \uc2 the American Civil Liberties Union\uc2 , if they can afford it. Because those are the people that will be fighting on our behalf, and we want them to go in with deep pockets, and to be able to wage war. But I also want people to go the movies, and have escapism. Every now and then I have to turn the news off, and guard my space, my home, with solace, with positive energy. We have four years to put up with this.\par \par \uc2 You won the Hasty Pudding. Had you visited Harvard before?\par \par \uc2 I visited it in my dreams. I knew my family couldn\u8217\'20\'19t afford it. Maybe I would\u8217\'20\'19ve gotten in \u8212\'20\'14 my grades were good, though not 4.0. I was a smart student but also a suck-up in a lot of ways. To be singled out by Harvard for my work was just humbling. It was just the most fun day ever.\par \par \uc2 Both films that you\u8217\'20\'19ve received Oscar nominations for feature an ensemble of women. I wonder if you feel at ease because you have a ton of siblings?\par \par \uc2 I\u8217\'20\'19m one of seven, I\u8217\'20\'19m next to the youngest, and there was one boy. Oh, I know about sisterhood, honey. Because I live in an ensemble sisterhood.\par \par \uc2 Does it feel different, this second Oscar nomination?\par \par \uc2 The first one, there\u8217\'20\'19s nothing to prepare you for it. The second time is even sweeter.\par \par \uc2 Now it\u8217\'20\'19s for this role, this woman who was not ever in her lifetime going to get this recognition. The fact that I\u8217\'20\'19m getting the recognition on her behalf is even sweeter.\par \par \uc2 Did you watch the nominations?\par \par \uc2 I watched them after. You hear people saying, \u8220\'20\'1COh, I wasn\u8217\'20\'19t up.\u8221\'20\'1D Believe me, you get up. I was terrified. I decided: \u8220\'20\'1CNo, I\u8217\'20\'19m going to wait. If the phone doesn\u8217\'20\'19t ring, I\u8217\'20\'19m going to enjoy my morning.\u8221\'20\'1D I didn\u8217\'20\'19t sleep. Then you know it\u8217\'20\'19s going to happen at 5:30. It\u8217\'20\'19s the longest 15 or 20 minutes. I thought, \u8220\'20\'1CO.K., it didn\u8217\'20\'19t happen.\u8221\'20\'1D Then the phone rang and it\u8217\'20\'19s like, \u8220\'20\'1CThank you, God.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Octavia Spencer of \u8220\'20\'1CHidden Figures,\u8221\'20\'1D attending the Screen Actors Guild Awards. | Frazer Harrison/Getty Images \par \par \uc2 Document NYTFEED020170203ed230040h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Much of the criticism of the executive order signed by President Trump has focused on foreigners prevented from entering the country, but a court filing in the legal battle over the travel ban reveals a far broader impact, imperiling the residency status of tens of thousands of immigrants -- everyone from asylum seekers to students and technology workers -- already living in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Amid a storm of protest, Mr. Trump on Thursday continued to stick by the ban as essential to the safety of the nation, saying that in the ''coming days, we will develop a system to help ensure that those admitted into our country fully embrace our values of religious and personal liberty.''\par \par \uc2 ''We want people to come into our nation, but we want people to love us and to love our values, not to hate us and to hate our values,'' Mr. Trump said at the National Prayer Breakfast.\par \par \uc2 Now, the Department of Homeland Security's internal auditor has entered the fray. The office of the department's inspector general announced late Wednesday that it would review how the agency carried out the executive order, which suspended the entry of all refugees for 120 days and blocked for 90 days citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The auditor said the review was a response to requests from Congress, whistle-blowers and to complaints received on a hotline.\par \par \uc2 In addition to reviewing how the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  carried out the executive order, the inspector general's office said it would review the agency's adherence to court orders and allegations of individual misconduct. The inspector general's office, which did not say how long its review would take, said it could look into other issues as well.\par \par \uc2 Following Mr. Trump's order, the State Department went even further than prohibiting those outside the country from entering: It issued an internal memorandum revoking the visas of all nationals from those countries, without notifying them, even those who are legally studying, working and living in the United States.\par \par \uc2 ''They aren't just seeking to prevent people from entering,'' said Greg Chen, director of advocacy for the \uc2 American Immigration Lawyers Association\uc2 . ''They are excluding people who have been here for a long time once they leave.''\par \par \uc2 Some immigration lawyers said they feared that the State Department's cancellation of visas could expose immigrants and other legal foreign residents to deportation, but officials at the State Department and the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  said those in the United States were not affected.\par \par \uc2 ''This does not apply to individuals who were in the country on a valid visa at the time the order was signed,'' said Gillian Christensen, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security.\par \par \uc2 Only a case-by-case exemption deemed in the national interest ''on the basis of a determination made by the secretaries of state and homeland security,'' restore the visas while the policy remained in place, the department said. The visas were revoked ''provisionally,'' according to the memo, and could be reinstated once a new policy is formulated.\par \par \uc2 But for now, the loss of their visas means that anyone from those countries who leaves the United States -- even for funerals or family health emergencies -- would be unable to return without getting a new visa, a lengthy process that cannot begin until the Trump administration has completed its review of the visa program.\par \par \uc2 Unlike the refugee ban, which was announced with much fanfare, the canceled visas came to light only as a result of court filings by government lawyers defending the ban on travelers from the seven countries against litigation.\par \par \uc2 Trump administration officials said they had chosen those seven countries based on concerns expressed by Obama administration officials, who in 2016 required anyone passing through the seven countries to get a visa. But those involved in the Obama administration effort said that the countries had largely been chosen by Congress as part of immigration legislation passed in 2015 and that the visa reviews were intended to catch Islamic State fighters and not to ban or inconvenience all of those countries' citizens.\par \par \uc2 ''My parents still live in Iran,'' said Mahsa Rouhi, an Iranian who holds a green card and is a research fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard's Kennedy School. ''My dad is 82, and if my parents are in need of urgent care, I could face a choice of my job and my life here and caring for my parents. I was advised -- most universities and institutions are advising people in my situation -- not to travel, not to take the risk.''\par \par \uc2 Sean Spicer\uc2 , the White House press secretary, said on Wednesday that legal permanent residents from the seven countries, also known as green card holders, would be able to enter the United States without getting special waivers. That was a change from the first days after the issuance of Mr. Trump's executive order, when even green card holders from the seven countries were detained at airports, told to leave the United States or forbidden to get on planes to the United States.\par \par \uc2 Yet even after the change, green card holders can be turned away at the border at the discretion of Customs and Border Protection officers, as only United States citizens have an irrevocable right to enter the country.\par \par \uc2 Just last year, the State Department issued 31,804 immigrant visas to people from the seven countries, according to a State Department tally. Thousands more were granted student and other visas last year, and those have also been revoked. The letter excepted only a few classes of visa holders, mainly diplomats and \uc2 NATO\uc2  military personnel, leaving au pairs and businesspeople, athletes and artists, even victims of human trafficking without exemptions.\par \par \uc2 ''Basically, they are trapped without some other measures they would have to take, another application process they would have to go through,'' said \uc2 Doris Meissner\uc2 , senior fellow and director of the United States immigration program at the Migration Policy Institute and a former commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump's travel ban led to chaos at American airports, left would-be immigrants stranded at airports around the world and shut refugees out of a country that had already issued them visas.\par \par \uc2 ''The gathering of the appropriate officials to actually make this order operational did not even happen until after the order was signed,'' Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, the top Democrat on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said in a statement on Wednesday after a closed-door briefing by Homeland Security officials. ''No wonder it was chaotic and rocky.''\par \par \uc2 Ali Hamandi, a Ph.D. candidate at Harvard in health policy, said he had just returned from speaking with \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2  officials about whether the policies could affect him. A Canadian citizen born in Iraq, he said he had found so much contradictory information online that he felt his only option was to cancel his travel plans and stay put.\par \par \uc2 ''There are layers of misinformation,'' Mr. Hamandi said. ''Emotionally it's quite devastating.''\par \par \uc2 In the hours after the executive order was signed, border officials detained or turned away anyone who was born in or had a passport from one of the seven countries, even those who also had citizenship in countries other than the targeted seven. But after the intervention of British and Canadian diplomats, Trump administration officials agreed to exempt dual-passport holders who presented passports from other countries. Under the new rules, dual citizens can now legally re-enter the United States if they leave, officials said.\par \par \uc2 Adding to the concern, several green card holders, including Ms. Rouhi, said they had received unexpected notification this week that their Global Entry Trusted Traveler Network status had been revoked.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for Customs and Border Protection declined to address the canceled Global Entry memberships but said that enrollees in the program, which allows approved, low-risk travelers expedited clearance into the United States when they arrive, can be kicked out for a number of reasons, including being inadmissible to the United States under immigration regulations.\par \par \uc2 Ali Vaez, a senior analyst for Iran at the International Crisis Group, a nonprofit organization, said he had learned that his membership in Global Entry was abruptly cut off on Tuesday when he received a message stating, ''You do not meet program eligibility requirements.'' Mr. Vaez said that although he had a green card, the sudden revocation of his Global Entry status had caused him to reconsider traveling outside the United States.\par \par \uc2 ''I thought because permanent residents were exempted from this, it was fine, but because my Global Entry status was revoked, I have new concerns,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 ''The rules and regulations are changing by the hour, by the day. There's a huge amount of uncertainty,'' Mr. Vaez said. With a wife and a house in Washington, he added, ''I just can't risk it.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Vaez noted that his green card had been granted under the national-interest provision of immigration law and that he has been allowed inside the Pentagon and even the White House Situation Room as part of his work.\par \par \uc2 ''What has not been vetted properly is not people like me, it's this new executive order,'' he said. ''That's really the problem.''\par \par \uc2 Logan Airport in Boston. The immigration order issued this week also revoked the visas of people already living in the United States. (PHOTOGRAPH BY M.

The prospect of traveling to the United States made me uneasy. I had heard stories of Syrians being singled out for interrogation at American airports. And I wasn't certain I would be able to get travel documents and an American visa anyway: Because of my political activities, I am a man without a passport. But then, after President Trump signed an executive order barring even Syrians with valid passports and visas from the United States, I knew I wouldn't be able to visit my American friends any time soon.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump's decision pronouncing Syrians dangerous and undesirable seemed quite similar to the way our own dictator, President Bashar al-Assad, has treated me and my countrymen. I have never had a passport. I was explicitly denied one by Mr. Assad's regime because I am a writer who opposed his father and opposes him. In 1980, I was a 19-year-old student of medicine at the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Aleppo when I joined the protests against the Hafez al-Assad regime. I was jailed along with hundreds of fellow left-wing students and activists. I spent 16 years in prison.\par \par \uc2 After my release in 1996, I returned to Aleppo and my medical studies. After graduating in 2000, I decided not to practice medicine, moved to Damascus and worked as a writer. In March 2011, Syrians rose up against the Bashar al-Assad regime. I decided to write without any self-censorship in support of the revolution. The cost of writing with freedom was that I had to leave my home in Damascus, hide in myriad places across the country, and eventually seek refuge in Turkey. To live in exile without a passport or travel documents is to live with the knowledge of limited mobility in a world of militarized bureaucracy.\par \par \uc2 The international disdain for Syrian refugees comes close to Mr. Assad's approach to his ill-fated subjects. Most Syrians were never issued passports. For the Assad regime, passports are political and disciplinary tools.\par \par \uc2 For Syrians, Mr. Trump is merely pushing to extremes a process that has been going on for years. The situation of the refugees, and the underprivileged in general, has been worsening everywhere for a generation. Syria exemplifies a greater global failure.\par \par \uc2 The executive order barring Syrians and the citizens of six other countries was among Mr. Trump's very first actions in the White House. Many of the objectives of the first week of his reign -- setting the stage to build a wall on the Mexico border, and cutting federal funds to environmental research and programs involving abortion -- are aimed at the vulnerable and the poor. It reveals a lot about the social and political outlook of his administration.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump's reactionary decree banning Syrian refugees and visitors from other Muslim-majority countries has dangerous side effects: It normalizes war criminals like Mr. Assad, dictators like Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, and helps the Islamic State and Al Qaeda. After the Sept. 11 attacks, the war on terrorism and the threat of Islamist militants became central to the way the United States saw and dealt with the world. Despotic regimes exploit this American fear of Islamist militancy and get away with brutal violence against dissenting populations of varying political and religious persuasions by projecting them as jihadists.\par \par \uc2 Terrorist networks like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State use discriminatory acts such as Mr. Trump's ban to depict the West as fundamentally anti-Muslim and position themselves as defenders of the Islamic realm. They thrive in a world of hatred, fear and retreat.\par \par \uc2 Among many Muslims, Mr. Trump's executive order is rightly perceived as Islamophobic and as encouraging sectarian divisions in both Syria and the region. But these are hardly new traits of American and Western policies in the Middle East.\par \par \uc2 As a Syrian, I can recall a shameful precedent for Mr. Trump's indifference toward the suffering of refugees. On Aug. 21, 2013, in its biggest chemical weapons attack, the Assad regime used sarin gas against the besieged East Ghouta area outside Damascus and killed more than 1,400 people, including 426 children. In mid-September 2013, the United States and Russia made a deal concerning Syria's chemical weapons. Under the deal Mr. Assad acceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention and submitted his chemical weapons (except chlorine, which doesn't fall under it), and in exchange he was exempted from punishment from their use and was practically guaranteed his survival.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Assad concluded rightly that he could continue killing rebels with any weapons except the chemical weapons. President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  chose not to enforce a no-fly zone, so Mr. Assad continued dropping barrel bombs on homes, schools and hospitals in rebel-held areas. Mr. Obama essentially did nothing to match the deal with any protections for the rebelling Syrians.\par \par \uc2 The chemical weapons deal was an enormous gift to extremist groups like the \uc2 Nusra Front\uc2  and the Islamic State, lending credibility to their nihilist discourse that the world is against us and those who seek justice for Muslims in the Western world order are misguided, even agents of crusaders.\par \par \uc2 The flight of millions of Syrians to neighboring countries and Europe only intensified after the chemical weapons agreement, which dealt a brutal blow to our hopes for political change. In 2014, the Assad regime started aggressive military offensives on multiple cities. Ethnic cleansing forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes. Barrel bomb attacks on residential areas were intensified. Thus the Syrian refugee crisis in 2014 and 2015 was born of the chemical weapons agreement in 2013.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump may be very different personalities, but so far, Mr. Trump's administration seems like just a continuation of Mr. Obama's in terms of its attitude toward Syria and the Middle East.\par \par \uc2 For about half a century, the people of the Middle East have been denied political freedoms, economic security and oppressed by violent juntas like the Assad regime. If a class of Americans felt let down by their political establishment, felt their economic security slipping away and elected Mr. Trump, why is it surprising that the Middle East has given rise to the Islamic State and Al Qaeda?\par \par \uc2 According to the \uc2 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\uc2 , more than four million Syrians are refugees in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt and Iraq. Around 6.3 million are internally displaced within Syria. Of these approximately 11 million Syrians who have lost their homes, the United States has accepted around 10,000.\par \par \uc2 His ban will strengthen the Islamic State and Al Qaeda as it creates a world in which people are left with little hope, and Muslims, in particular, are discriminated against.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump is considering ''safe zones'' in Syria for Syrian refugees. But given his worldview and his relationship with President \uc2 Vladimir V. Putin\uc2  of Russia, an Assad ally, nothing encourages us to think of it as an effort to protect an exposed and dehumanized people from the Assad regime or from the Islamic State and other terrorist organizations. I am afraid Mr. Trump's ''safe zones'' will simply confine and isolate us. Mr. Trump should realize that we already have such an arrangement in place to quarantine Syrians: Mr. Assad's Syria.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Yassin al-Haj Saleh, the author of the forthcoming ''Impossible Revolution,'' is a Syrian writer and dissident in exile in Turkey.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020170203ed230006u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc51}{\*\bkmkend toc51}\b \uc2 Obama Policy Accelerating Deportations Is Reversed\b0\par\par\uc2 By CAITLIN DICKERSON and LIZ ROBBINS \par \uc2 807 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 February 2017\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 19\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The Justice Department this week rescinded the Obama administration's policy of speeding up hearings and deportations of families and children seeking refuge in the United States, a move applauded by immigration advocates who had called the practice unfair and ineffective.\par \par \uc2 The expedited hearings were started in 2014 to deal with increasing numbers of people fleeing Central America, in hopes of deterring additional migration. But the policy was largely viewed as a failure in that regard, as even more people from the region sought relief in the past two years than in 2014.\par \par \uc2 The reversal this week was a rare occasion for advocates to cheer the Trump administration after two weeks of moves they decried.\par \par \uc2 ''This is a good thing,'' said Bryan Johnson, an immigration lawyer in New York. ''They are going back to common sense.''\par \par \uc2 The reversal, explained in a memo from the country's chief immigration judge, MaryBeth Keller, to judges nationwide, said the change would let the courts focus more on immigrants in detention centers who are awaiting deportation hearings, a costly population and a higher priority for the government. Families and children applying for asylum are usually not detained while their cases are being considered.\par \par \uc2 Lauren Alder, a spokeswoman for the Executive Office for Immigration Review, the arm of the Justice Department that oversees the immigration courts, said the new policy reflected ''the present state of the immigration system,'' adding that changes in court practices ''should not be interpreted as long-term solutions to fix the broken system, but are short-term solutions to manage the growing caseload.''\par \par \uc2 While they applauded the change in policy, some immigration advocates also interpreted it as a bid to clear the dockets for an anticipated increase in deportations under President Trump, who has promised a more restrictive approach to immigration. Since taking office on Jan. 20, he has signed orders that threatened to punish cities that do not collaborate with federal efforts to identify undocumented immigrants, paused refugee resettlement and temporarily suspended immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries.\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration's ''rocket docket'' approach was an attempt to deal with a flood of border crossings, many of them unaccompanied minors arriving without parents. Under the policy, those seeking asylum and other forms of relief would have their cases decided within months, rather than years.\par \par \uc2 The policy was widely criticized by advocates who felt it unrealistic to expect children and parents fleeing violence to prepare asylum cases -- which are among the most complex immigration cases -- within months. Immigration courts, unlike criminal courts, do not confer the right to legal representation. Those who go before immigration judges must pay for their own lawyers or seek help from a limited number of pro bono representatives.\par \par \uc2 The percentage winning asylum has ranged from 14 to 21 percent over the last three years, according to federal data compiled by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a research group connected to \uc2 Syracuse \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2 . The rest are ordered deported.\par \par \uc2 The immigration judges' union also welcomed the change, saying that under the previous policy, many Central Americans' cases were not ultimately expedited because they often arrived in court unprepared, only to request postponements.\par \par \uc2 ''We think it is an excellent move,'' said Denise Slavin, the vice president of the union. ''Judges will work much more efficiently, because we'll be hearing cases that will be ready to be heard.''\par \par \uc2 It was not clear whether the policy change had been in the works before Mr. Trump took office. Last year, the Obama administration began scaling back the use of expedited asylum hearings, employing them only about half the time.\par \par \uc2 About 60,000 unaccompanied Central American minors were counted entering the United States in the 2016 fiscal year, a slight increase from two years earlier, according to the federal health department, which houses the children in juvenile facilities until they are placed with a sponsor. The number of Central American families counted crossing the border also rose, according to the Border Patrol.\par \par \uc2 In New York City's immigration court at 26 Federal Plaza, word of the new policy was beginning to trickle out on Thursday, though its immediate impact for those now in court was unclear.\par \par \uc2 One of them, a 19-year-old Honduran named Auner, who spoke in the hallway on the condition that only his first name be used because of his pending case, said that he was not aware of the accelerated processing of Central American cases. But even had he known, he said, he still would have come.\par \par \uc2 ''Absolutely,'' he said in Spanish. ''It was not safe. I could not study because of the gangs. It was worth it to risk myself.''\par \par \uc2 Follow Caitlin Dickerson on Twitter: @itscaitlinhd.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Huge protests, among the largest since the fall of communism, have rocked Romania after the government passed a law that would effectively allow official corruption.\par \par \uc2 More than 250,000 Romanians took to the streets, about half of them in the capital, Bucharest. ''Thieves, thieves,'' they shouted, denouncing the government and corruption. A few demonstrators clashed with riot police.\par \par \uc2 The protests -- which continued Thursday night and were expected to swell further over the weekend -- erupted after the government adopted an emergency law on Tuesday night that would make official misconduct punishable by prison time only in cases in which the financial damage is more than 200,000 lei, or about $47,000.\par \par \uc2 The measure had been debated for several weeks, but the government decided to adopt it abruptly late on Tuesday night, stunning observers. Officials including Liviu Dragnea, the leader of the governing Social Democratic Party, stand to benefit from the measure. Mr. Dragnea faces charges of abuse of power involving a sum of 24,000 euros, or about $25,800.\par \par \uc2 Romania's top judicial watchdog, the Superior Magistrates' Council, on Wednesday issued a constitutional court challenge to the decree. Another body, the Higher Judicial Council, which helps oversee the court system, has also challenged the law.\par \par \uc2 President Klaus Iohannis, whose role as head of state is largely ceremonial but who commands respect in many parts of the country, asked the constitutional court to strike it down.\par \par \uc2 ''I am very impressed by the scale of demonstrations that took place last night in the entire country,'' he said in a statement on Thursday, praising the latest in a series of protests at which he himself has turned up.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Iohannis, who was elected in 2014 as the first president from the country's German-speaking minority, called Tuesday a ''day of mourning for the rule of law.''\par \par \uc2 In the northwestern city of Cluj, Raluca Sandor, a 30-year-old pharmacist, braved cold weather to take part in the demonstrations.\par \par \uc2 ''This decree will drag Romania back in time,'' she said. ''The Social Democratic Party is the most corrupt party, and they are trying to save themselves from prosecution. I want the government to resign and these decrees to be canceled.''\par \par \uc2 Another demonstrator in Cluj, Alexandrin Pop, 30, said, ''I'm protesting because I see this as an assault on the judiciary and the rule of law.''\par \par \uc2 Alexandra Zaraf, 27, one of many young protesters in Bucharest, asked, ''What self-respecting government issues emergency ordinances at 9 p.m. and publishes it in the middle of the night?'' She added, ''In a world where we talk about corruption, they want to change legislation and encourage it or go easy on punishing it.''\par \par \uc2 Until recently, Romania, which joined the \uc2 European Union\uc2  in 2007, along with Bulgaria, was seen as making slow but steady progress on corruption. The new law threatens to create a new problem for the bloc's executives in Brussels, who are already troubled by problems like the Greek debt crisis, sluggish growth among the countries that use the euro currency and Britain's plans for withdrawing from the bloc.\par \par \uc2 Analysts feared that the government could further reverse the country's progress and that an open conflict between the government and the president could create a lasting deadlock.\par \par \uc2 ''The fight against corruption needs to be advanced, not undone,'' \uc2 Jean-Claude Juncker\uc2  and Frans Timmermans, the president and vice president of the European Commission, said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 But the government appeared to stand its ground. On Wednesday night, Florin Iordache, the minister of justice, whose portfolio the measures belong to, published a message on his \uc2 Facebook\uc2  page, urging the protesters to read the text of the decree themselves.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't understand what the protesters are upset about,'' Mr. Dragnea said before the decree was passed on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 What infuriated the crowds was that the decrees ''gave people the impression that the government is legislating in its own benefit,'' said Alina Mungiu-Pippidi, a professor at Hertie School of Governance in Berlin, who runs a website that monitors corruption in the country.\par \par \uc2 In fact, senior political and business figures, including Mr. Dragnea, were under investigation and likely to be convicted under the rules the decree was concerning.\par \par \uc2 ''Romania is far from being a success story,'' Ms. Mungiu-Pippidi said in a telephone interview. ''We ended impunity, we managed to put in jail very important people. But the problem is that corruption has not gone down -- people who replaced those people behave similarly.''\par \par \uc2 The country's anticorruption prosecution service, which was behind many of those arrests, is investigating over 2,000 cases of abuse of power. It warned its work would be hampered by the new regulation. In a statement before the decree was passed on Tuesday, the service said it would benefit both future infractors and those already being investigated for abuse of power.\par \par \uc2 Romania's new government was elected at the end of last year by a large majority but on low turnout, less than 40 percent. The Social Democrats came back to power only a year after they were ousted by similar demonstrations. According to analysts, they succeeded with a platform that appealed to the country's struggling middle classes -- many of whom live and work elsewhere in Europe, but send money home -- promising lower taxes and higher wages.\par \par \uc2 ''This is a disaster for the Social Democratic Party, which wanted to change its image of a corrupt party and show that there is a new generation prepared to rule,'' said Sergiu Miscoiu, a professor of political science at Babes-Bolyai \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  in Cluj.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Miscoiu described the ruling party as ''a rural conservative party with a left-wing component in social and economic policies'' that was more similar to the ruling conservatives in neighboring Hungary and Poland than their leftist counterparts. He said the Social Democrats could follow the playbook of the right-wing leaders in those countries, consolidating power and clashing with the \uc2 European Union\uc2 , and ''playing a little bit on the populist, nationalist side, trying to show that Romania has the right to have its own policies, including in justice.''\par \par \uc2 The party was behind a measure last year to scrap the mandatory television license, fees from which support public broadcasting -- a move that critics said would compromise the independence of the state television and radio stations. Mr. Dragnea this month also pushed for more control over nongovernmental organizations that receive funds from abroad. Organizations backed by the American financier \uc2 George Soros\uc2  had ''financed evil'' in Romania, Mr. Dragnea was quoted as saying.\par \par \uc2 Follow Palko Karasz on Twitter @karaszpalko .\par \par \uc2 Riot police officers detaining protesters on Wednesday in Bucharest.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 BUDAPEST -- When President \uc2 Vladimir V. Putin\uc2  of Russia last paid a visit to Hungary, Prime Minister \uc2 Viktor Orban\uc2  was under siege for his autocratic style, Russia was isolated for its seizure of Crimea, and both men were called xenophobes for their hard-line stance on immigration.\par \par \uc2 Two years later, as Mr. Putin landed on Thursday for his first foray into Europe in the Trump era, it was a different story. Both men feel vindicated. There is talk of lifting the economic sanctions placed on Russia for its land grab in Ukraine. Their brand of nationalism has moved from the fringe to the mainstream.\par \par \uc2 There was a note of triumphalism, even a bit of swagger, in the air.\par \par \uc2 ''We all sense, it's in the air, that the world is in the process of a substantial realignment,'' Mr. Orban said in a news conference after Thursday's meeting. ''We believe this will create favorable conditions for stronger Russian-Hungarian relations.''\par \par \uc2 Even so, beneath the triumph lies a strain of uneasiness. The visit is expected to be fairly low-key, an indication of the uncertainty surrounding the new Trump administration, analysts say. President Trump's intentions remain unclear, and the prospects of a grand bargain between Washington and the Kremlin are highly uncertain.\par \par \uc2 In the meantime, leaders across Europe have been forced to recalculate the best way to balance pressures in the East and West. Nowhere is that challenge felt more keenly than in Central and Eastern Europe, historically torn between Russia and the West.\par \par \uc2 That means European and global leaders are closely scrutinizing the visit. They are looking for hints of how aggressive Mr. Putin and populist leaders like Mr. Orban will be in capitalizing on this new international climate and on Mr. Trump's stated desire for better relations with Moscow.\par \par \uc2 If Thursday's post-meeting news conference is any indication, any hints of aggression are well buried. Both leaders focused on economic issues, such as Russian energy deals, and emphasized the need for international cooperation.\par \par \uc2 ''I provided information in great detail on our assessment of what is happening in eastern Ukraine and what, in our opinion, is happening in Syria,'' Mr. Putin said -- which, he added, underlines the need for more global cooperation to fight terrorism.\par \par \uc2 Many here, skeptical that the Americans and Russians will actually bridge the chasm of interests dividing them, are injecting a note of caution about the balancing act ahead for leaders like Mr. Orban and his governing right-wing party, Fidesz.\par \par \uc2 Andras Racz, a Russia expert and associate professor at Pazmany Peter Catholic \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  in Budapest, predicted that the reset in relations between the United States and Russia would result in ''a brief honeymoon, but nothing else, soon overwritten by conflicting interests.''\par \par \uc2 As for Hungary, ''there is no trust on the Russian side towards Orban,'' Mr. Racz said. The Hungarian leader has been seen mostly as a useful tool for weakening \uc2 European Union\uc2  unity, he said.\par \par \uc2 And the feeling is mutual, said Balazs Orban, director of research for the Szazadveg Foundation, a think tank that advises the Fidesz party.\par \par \uc2 ''Fidesz doesn't feel chemistry with the Russians,'' he said. ''They don't think they are friends of Hungary, necessarily.''\par \par \uc2 The warmer relations of recent years, he said, had more to do with economic necessity and Hungary's dependence on Russian energy.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, Zoltan Kovacs, \uc2 Viktor Orban\uc2 's spokesman, said in an interview that both nations would treat Mr. Putin's visit as ''business as usual,'' with energy policy and a Russian deal to build a nuclear power plant in Hungary at the top of the agenda.\par \par \uc2 It was not clear how significant a role, if any, the thorniest issue between Russia and the West -- the sanctions imposed by the \uc2 European Union\uc2  and the United States after the seizure of Crimea -- would play in the meeting. But Mr. Putin is clearly eager to have the sanctions lifted, and to sow divisions in the \uc2 European Union\uc2  on that policy and others.\par \par \uc2 Hungary may be among the nations most susceptible to Mr. Putin's maneuvering to remove the sanctions. Mr. Orban has voted with other European nations to support them, as a show of solidarity.\par \par \uc2 When Hungary's foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, visited Moscow last week to prepare for Mr. Putin's visit, he described the sanctions as ''counterproductive and harmful'': an indicator, some thought, of weakening Hungarian resolve.\par \par \uc2 But since then, Mr. Trump has said that it is ''too early'' to revisit the issue, but that he remains open to easing sanctions down the road. In separate phone conversations he had last weekend with Mr. Putin and Chancellor \uc2 Angela Merkel\uc2  of Germany, who strongly supports the sanctions, the subject did not even come up.\par \par \uc2 And that pattern held on Thursday, when neither leader mentioned the word ''sanctions'' in their public statements.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Orban, though, did allude to the sanctions, saying that some nations in ''the western side of the Continent have shown very anti-Russian policies,'' which have harmed the Hungarian economy ''for reasons which are beyond us.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Orban's hosting of Mr. Putin is the first part of a busy year of global outreach. Efforts are underway to arrange a meeting with Mr. Trump -- the timing and location are still under discussion -- and Mr. Orban is also planning a visit to Beijing and a meeting with Turkey's increasingly autocratic leader, \uc2 Recep Tayyip Erdogan\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''Orban has collected some credits in the international sphere,'' said Balazs Orban, the researcher, who is not related to the prime minister. ''He forecast everything correctly, like immigration.''\par \par \uc2 Now, seeing a potential ally in Washington to balance the one in Moscow, the prime minister intends to cash those credits.\par \par \uc2 ''He understands geopolitics is changing,'' Balazs Orban said: The notion that all nations need to embrace globalism and ''the liberal world order'' is no longer automatically accepted.\par \par \uc2 The Hungarian prime minister's chief opposition comes from the far-right Jobbik Party. Its leader, Gabor Vona, said in an interview this week that he had ''very mixed feelings about \uc2 Donald J. Trump\uc2 's election,'' and that he was unsure how seriously to take Mr. Trump's talk. He said he would wait ''to see what will be unfurled.''\par \par \uc2 Russia has been accused of backing fringe parties in an effort to destabilize the \uc2 European Union\uc2  and \uc2 NATO\uc2 , but Mr. Vona denied persistent rumors that Jobbik received money from the Kremlin, calling it government propaganda.\par \par \uc2 Nevertheless, Mr. Vona said Jobbik would welcome a grand bargain between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin.\par \par \uc2 ''We will only be happy if relations between the U.S. and Russia improve,'' he said. If that bargain includes the creation of new ''spheres of influence'' for Russia and the West, as Mr. Putin dearly wishes, so much the better.\par \par \uc2 In such a world, the prime minister's spokesman, Mr. Kovacs, made clear that Hungary would be working for more latitude to pursue its own interests, even while staying in the \uc2 European Union\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''We don't want to step out of the \uc2 European Union\uc2 ,'' he said. ''We want to reform it,'' turning it from a ''United States of Europe'' into an alliance of more independent, sovereign nations whose leaders can govern without what Mr. Kovacs characterized as undue influence from the organization's bureaucrats in Brussels.\par \par \uc2 ''At the same time, we all sense there is going to be a resetting of the relationship with Moscow, and Hungary would like to be there,'' Mr. Kovacs said. ''It is not a bipolar world anymore. It is a multipolar world that is emerging.''\par \par \uc2 President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was hosted by Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary on Thursday in Budapest.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 YANGON, Myanmar -- The soft-spoken rights lawyer had devised a plan to replace Myanmar's Constitution with one that would strip the military of its extraordinary political powers.\par \par \uc2 The lawyer, U Ko Ni, a top adviser to the governing National League for Democracy, had recently been working on a new draft, a colleague said, and he hoped to promote his project at a conference this month.\par \par \uc2 But when he returned to the Yangon airport on Sunday from a trip to Indonesia, cradling his young grandson in his arms as he waited for a taxi, a man drew a pistol and shot him in the head.\par \par \uc2 The killing appears to have been a rare political assassination in Myanmar, fueling rumors, distrust and worry about the country's future.\par \par \uc2 ''This bullet was not only for Ko Ni,'' the colleague, U Thein Than Oo, a human rights lawyer in Mandalay, Myanmar, said by telephone. ''It was for the N.L.D. and the people who want to amend and replace the 2008 Constitution and support the peace process.''\par \par \uc2 The Myanmar police have said that the assailant, detained shortly after the shooting, was a professional hit man, and they have arrested three other suspects in the attack, including the man they say hired the killer. The police have not announced a motive for the killing.\par \par \uc2 It is not clear whether Mr. Ko Ni could have succeeded in changing the Constitution, although colleagues said he had been pressing the case. While unverified rumors swirled on Myanmar's social media this week that the military was behind the killing, the police said there was no evidence to support the claims.\par \par \uc2 The assistant secretary of the military-controlled Home Affairs Ministry, U Maung Maung Myint, issued a statement on Wednesday denying rumors that the home affairs minister, Lt. Gen. Kyaw Swe, had orchestrated the killing.\par \par \uc2 But even as a few details began to leak out, there were still more questions than answers.\par \par \uc2 Those guessing at motives noted that Mr. Ko Ni, 65, was one of the country's most prominent Muslims in a majority Buddhist country torn by religious strife.\par \par \uc2 But he was hardly a firebrand. While he did not hesitate to advocate the legal rights of Muslims and other minorities whenever he felt they were threatened, he did not promote Islamic law and he backed a decision by the National League for Democracy not to field Muslim candidates in the 2015 election, telling a reporter at the time that it was not worth it given the polarized political climate.\par \par \uc2 Instead, he expressed an inclusive vision that was shaped in part by his background as the son of an ethnic Burmese and Buddhist mother and a Muslim father from India.\par \par \uc2 ''He was a man who could appreciate different traditions precisely because his own tradition in his country did not always receive the respect that it deserved,'' said Melissa Crouch, an expert on Myanmar's Constitution at the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of New South Wales\uc2  in Sydney, Australia.\par \par \uc2 The main suspect, U Kyi Lin, had been jailed from 2003 to 2014 for smuggling ancient Buddha statues, according to police statements and leaked police documents. That would hardly be the profile of a radical Buddhist.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kyi Lin was pardoned in 2014 in a prisoner amnesty by the government of former President \uc2 Thein Sein\uc2 , who was an army general.\par \par \uc2 Some lawyers wondered how the gunman had acquired a 9-millimeter pistol, which is manufactured by the Myanmar Army, in a country where civilian firearm sales have been prohibited for decades. There was also speculation about how the attacker could have carried out the killing in daylight in a public place that is among the country's most secure and that regularly hosts national and foreign dignitaries.\par \par \uc2 All of which lead Mr. Ko Ni's friends and colleagues back to his efforts to challenge the military and its powerful supporters.\par \par \uc2 A canny constitutional lawyer, Mr. Ko Ni had outmaneuvered the military before.\par \par \uc2 Before the military dictatorship that ruled Myanmar for nearly 50 years allowed democratic elections, it left in place a Constitution that barred anyone with a spouse or child with foreign citizenship from becoming president. That clause was aimed at one person: Daw \uc2 Aung San Suu Kyi\uc2 , the popular Nobel laureate and leader of the National League for Democracy, whose husband, now dead, was British and whose sons are also British citizens.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ko Ni is widely credited with helping devise the strategy that allowed her to take power after her party won a landslide election in 2015. Parliament created a new position, state counselor, that would be above the president and appointed her to the job.\par \par \uc2 Richard Horsey, a political analyst and former United Nations official in Yangon, called the move a legal ''fudge'' that may have survived because \uc2 Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\uc2 's party controlled the courts. But he said that Mr. Ko Ni was among the most knowledgeable legal minds in the National League for Democracy orbit.\par \par \uc2 ''There aren't many people like that, so in that sense, he played a very important role,'' Mr. Horsey said.\par \par \uc2 But the party has long had another target: eliminating the special powers for the military enshrined in the Constitution, including a crucial veto. The veto is actually two parts: a quota that allocates a quarter of the seats in Parliament to the military, and the requirement of a 75 percent majority to pass a constitutional amendment.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ko Ni had proposed introducing a bill on a referendum about drafting a new constitution. The bill could be passed with a simple majority, which the National League for Democracy could easily muster.\par \par \uc2 ''If the military still focuses on protecting its interests, it will be impossible to change any part of the Constitution within Parliament,'' he said last year, according to The Myanmar Times. ''That's why writing a new one is the best way to pursue a democratic Constitution.''\par \par \uc2 Party officials, however, have not publicly endorsed this solution, and U Win Htein, a party leader contacted this week, said the party still favored amending, rather than replacing, the Constitution.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Ko Ni was still promoting the idea, and one colleague, Mr. Thein Than Oo, said that ''one of his last works'' had been drafting a new Constitution.\par \par \uc2 The consequences of the killing for the country will depend on what motive is ultimately established, as well as the transparency of the police investigation.\par \par \uc2 But the killing has already demonstrated that the rule of law in Myanmar remains fragile, and it could further erode the National League for Democracy's ability to govern, said Elliot Brennan, a Myanmar specialist and a research fellow at the Institute for Security and Development Policy in Stockholm.\par \par \uc2 Initial expectations that the party could bring major changes to Myanmar were ''far too high, and we've been waiting for the expectations, the red balloon, to pop,'' he said. ''The assassination might not be the final pinprick, but we're getting very close.''\par \par \uc2 That the party leadership has said little about the killing has raised questions about its ability to handle the situation. \uc2 Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\uc2 , who has faced international criticism for recent military operations in far-western Rakhine State against the Rohingya, a persecuted Muslim minority, has also been rebuked.\par \par \uc2 The office of Myanmar's president, U Htin Kyaw, said in a statement on Monday that the attack had been carried out to undermine the country's stability. U Zaw Htay, a spokesman for \uc2 Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\uc2 , later said that the statement by the president's office had been made on her behalf.\par \par \uc2 But \uc2 Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\uc2  did not attend Mr. Ko Ni's funeral, and his daughter, Dr. Yin Nwe Khaine, said on Wednesday that, to the best of her knowledge, \uc2 Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\uc2  had not sent condolences.\par \par \uc2 She said she knew that her father's work carried risks, but that he never talked about them at home.\par \par \uc2 ''He always said that lawyers are forever worrying, and he never wanted to pass those worries on to his family,'' she said by telephone, fighting back tears.\par \par \uc2 But he did train her to be strong in difficult times, she added, and this was one of them.\par \par \uc2 ''My father is my hero,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Follow Mike Ives on Twitter @mikeives.\par \par \uc2 The funeral of U Ko Ni, a top adviser to the governing National League for Democracy, in Yangon, Myanmar, on Monday.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 SEOUL, South Korea -- On his first mission to reassure an important American ally, Defense Secretary \uc2 Jim Mattis\uc2  met on Thursday with top South Korean officials, who agreed to push ahead with the deployment of a new missile defense system.\par \par \uc2 ''Thaad is for defense of our allies' people, of our troops who are committed to their defense,'' Mr. Mattis told reporters, using the acronym for Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, the American antimissile system. It is meant to intercept North Korea's medium-range missiles.\par \par \uc2 ''Were it not for the provocative behavior of North Korea, we would have no need for Thaad out here,'' Mr. Mattis added. ''There is no other nation that needs to be concerned about Thaad.''\par \par \uc2 South Korea was a logical first stop for Mr. Mattis, who will also visit Japan on the trip. Tensions have risen in the region after \uc2 Kim Jong-un\uc2 , the North Korean leader, proclaimed during his New Year's Day address that his military was preparing to conduct its first test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile.\par \par \uc2 Asian nations have also been concerned about the conflicting signals from President Trump about the United States' posture in the region. The most recent one was a contentious phone call between Mr. Trump and the Australian prime minister, which was disclosed just as Mr. Mattis began his Asia trip.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump mused during his election campaign that the United States could save money if nations like South Korea and Japan developed their own nuclear weapons -- comments that ran counter to decades of American nonproliferation policy.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump said on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  last month that North Korea would be prevented from developing the ability to reach the United States with a nuclear weapon. But he did not say whether he was referring to military or diplomatic actions. ''It won't happen,'' he tersely declared of a North Korean missile test.\par \par \uc2 One of Mr. Trump's first acts as president was to formally withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, which had been an important pillar of the Obama administration's policy in the region. Critics say the withdrawal by the United States will give China an opportunity to expand its influence.\par \par \uc2 More recently, in a phone call on Saturday, Mr. Trump reassured the Japanese prime minister, \uc2 Shinzo Abe\uc2 , of the United States' ''ironclad'' commitment to Japan's security, according to a statement from the White House. Mr. Trump made a similar assurance to South Korea on Monday in a call with the country's acting president, Hwang Kyo-ahn.\par \par \uc2 The various messages -- some spontaneous, some premeditated -- have turned Mr. Mattis's otherwise traditional statements of support for South Korea and Japan into messages with strategic importance.\par \par \uc2 ''It is a priority for President Trump's administration to pay attention to the northwest Pacific,'' Mr. Mattis said. ''I am going to get current by listening to them, finding out where their issues are, and then we are going to work together and strengthen our alliance.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Mattis met with an array of officials in Seoul, including Mr. Hwang, who is the country's prime minister as well as serving as acting president during the impeachment trial of President Park Geun-hye. If she is removed, a new presidential election may be held as early as the spring, so the fraught political situation in South Korea poses a challenge for the United States.\par \par \uc2 ''Mattis is going to meet with people who probably aren't going to be in office in a few months,'' said Joel S. Wit, a Korea expert at the School of Advanced International Studies at \uc2 Johns Hopkins \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The Thaad system is designed to intercept missiles like the Rodong, which is believed to have enough range to reach all of South Korea and some parts of Japan. The United States and South Korea initially said they wanted to deploy the Thaad system by the end of the year, but given the North's bellicose behavior, there has been some speculation that it may be deployed sooner.\par \par \uc2 Under its arrangement with Washington, South Korea would provide land and build a base for a Thaad battery, while the United States would pay for the missile system, which would be built by \uc2 Lockheed Martin\uc2 , and then cover its operational costs.\par \par \uc2 During Mr. Mattis's meeting with Mr. Hwang, the allies confirmed that they would deploy the Thaad system as planned.\par \par \uc2 ''Secretary Mattis reaffirmed the United States' firm defense commitment to South Korea, including the provision of extended deterrence, and said that the Trump administration will be treating the North Korean nuclear threat as a top-priority security issue,'' the office of Kim Kwan-jin, South Korea's director of national security, said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 Mindful of the possible early election, crucial opposition leaders in Seoul are opposing the deployment of the Thaad system. They say it would do little to defend South Korea from the North's plentiful short-range missiles but would anger China, which might retaliate economically. The Chinese have long objected to any deployment of limited missile defenses, out of concern that it would lead to a more comprehensive antimissile shield that could fend off Beijing's own nuclear missiles.\par \par \uc2 Moon Jae-in, an opposition leader who is considered the front-runner among potential presidential candidates, has argued that South Korea should use the Thaad program as diplomatic leverage with China, keeping open the possibility that it would not be deployed if China helped rein in North Korea.\par \par \uc2 ''Given our standoff with North Korea and its nuclear program, our security and the alliance with the United States are our top priority,'' Mr. Moon told reporters recently. ''But the best scenario for us is when the U.S. and China get along well. If there is friction between the two, it's not going to be easy for us.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hwang, in contrast, has said that the Thaad deployment is ''inevitable'' because of the North's rapidly growing missile threat.\par \par \uc2 ''Thaad is a defense tool whose deployment should not be delayed any more,'' he said at a recent news conference. ''We are explaining our position in various ways to neighboring countries like China, who are concerned about the Thaad deployment.''\par \par \uc2 Follow Michael R.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc56}{\*\bkmkend toc56}\b \uc2 Pregnant and Smoking Pot, With Risks Unclear\b0\par\par\uc2 By CATHERINE SAINT LOUIS \par \uc2 1,527 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 February 2017\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 During her pregnancy, she never drank alcohol or had a cigarette. But nearly every day, Stacey, then 24, smoked marijuana.\par \par \uc2 With her fianc\u233\'00\'E9's blessing, she began taking a few puffs in her first trimester to quell morning sickness before going to work at a sandwich shop. When sciatica made it unbearable to stand during her 12-hour shifts, she discreetly vaped marijuana oil on her lunch break.\par \par \uc2 ''I wouldn't necessarily say, 'Go smoke a pound of pot when you're pregnant,''' said Stacey, now a stay-at-home mother in Deltona, Fla., who asked that her full name be withheld because street-bought marijuana is illegal in Florida. ''In moderation, it's O.K.''\par \par \uc2 Many pregnant women, particularly younger ones, seem to agree, a recent federal survey shows. As states legalize marijuana or its medical use, expectant mothers are taking it up in increasing numbers -- another example of the many ways in which acceptance of marijuana has outstripped scientific understanding of its effects on human health.\par \par \uc2 Often pregnant women presume that cannabis has no consequences for developing infants. But preliminary research suggests otherwise: Marijuana's main psychoactive ingredient -- tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC -- can cross the placenta to reach the fetus, experts say, potentially harming brain development, cognition and birth weight. THC can also be present in breast milk.\par \par \uc2 ''There is an increased perception of the safety of cannabis use, even in pregnancy, without data to say it's actually safe,'' said Dr. Torri Metz, an obstetrician at Denver Health Medical Center who specializes in high-risk pregnancies. Ten percent of her patients acknowledge recent marijuana use.\par \par \uc2 In the federal survey, published online in December, almost 4 percent of mothers-to-be said they had used marijuana in the past month in 2014, compared with 2.4 percent in 2002. (By comparison, roughly 9 percent of pregnant women ages 18 to 44 acknowledge using alcohol in the previous month.)\par \par \uc2 Young mothers-to-be were particularly likely to turn to marijuana: Roughly 7.5 percent of 18- to 25-year-olds said they had used pot in the past month in 2014, compared with 2 percent of women ages 26 to 44.\par \par \uc2 Evidence on the effects of prenatal marijuana use is still limited and sometimes contradictory. Some of the most extensive data come from two sets of researchers, in Pittsburgh and in Ottawa, who have long studied children exposed to THC in the womb.\par \par \uc2 In Pittsburgh, 6-year-olds born to mothers who had smoked one joint or more daily in the first trimester showed a decreased ability to understand concepts in listening and reading. At age 10, children exposed to THC in utero were more impulsive than other children and less able to focus their attention.\par \par \uc2 Most troubling, children of mothers who used marijuana heavily in the first trimester had lower scores in reading, math and spelling at age 14 than their peers.\par \par \uc2 ''Prenatal exposure can affect the adolescent pretty significantly,'' said Dr. Lauren M. Jansson, the director of pediatrics at the Center for Addiction and Pregnancy at the Johns Hopkins \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  School of Medicine.\par \par \uc2 Several studies have found changes in the brains of fetuses, 18 to 22 weeks old, linked to maternal marijuana use. In male fetuses who were exposed, for instance, researchers have noted abnormal function of the amygdala, the part of the brain that regulates emotion.\par \par \uc2 ''Even early in development, marijuana is changing critical circuits and neurotransmitting receptors,'' said Dr. Yasmin Hurd, a neuroscientist and the director of the addiction center at \uc2 Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai\uc2  in Manhattan. ''Those are important for regulation of emotions and reward, even motor function and cognition.''\par \par \uc2 It is already well documented that the developing brains of teenagers can be altered with regular marijuana use, even eventually reducing I.Q.\par \par \uc2 ''The effects are not dramatic, but that doesn't mean they are not important,'' said Jodi Gilman, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School who studies adolescent users of cannabis. ''It could make the difference between getting an A and getting a B.''\par \par \uc2 ''You could imagine that a similar subtle effect may be present in those who were exposed prenatally to marijuana,'' she added.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 American Academy of Pediatrics\uc2  and the \uc2 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists\uc2  both advise against prenatal cannabis use because of its links to cognitive impairment and academic underachievement. But many state and federal agencies avoid the topic.\par \par \uc2 Of five federal agencies, only the National Institute on Drug Abuse had any information about prenatal marijuana use on its website as of last February, according to a study published online in December in the journal Substance Abuse. Only 10 state health departments did.\par \par \uc2 Until recently, the \uc2 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\uc2  offered nothing.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't think public health officials should be alarming people,'' said Marian Jarlenski, the study's lead author and an assistant professor at the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health. ''They just have to say, 'There have been studies done, and there is some risk.'''\par \par \uc2 In a statement, C.D.C. officials expressed concern about memory and attention problems among children exposed to THC in utero.\par \par \uc2 ''While current evidence on health consequences is inconsistent, some studies have found risks associated with marijuana use during pregnancy, such as low birth weight or preterm birth,'' the agency said.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Marie McCormick, a pediatrician and the chairwoman of a new report on cannabis from the \uc2 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine\uc2 , said smoking cannabis ''does confer, in terms of birth weight, the same risk as cigarettes.''\par \par \uc2 Some of the gathering evidence is reassuring. So far, prenatal cannabis exposure does not appear to be linked to obvious birth defects. ''That's why some providers and lay people alike think there's no effect,'' said Dr. Erica Wymore, a neonatologist at Children's Hospital Colorado. But she warned, ''Just because they don't have a major birth defect or overt withdrawal symptoms doesn't mean the baby's neurological development is not impacted.''\par \par \uc2 Most research in this area was done when the drug was far less potent. Marijuana had 12 percent THC in 2014, while in 1995 it was just 4 percent, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\par \par \uc2 ''All those really good earlier studies on marijuana effects aren't telling us what we need to know now about higher concentration levels,'' said Therese Grant, an epidemiologist and director of the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Washington's fetal alcohol and drug unit. ''We need to do a whole lot more research now.''\par \par \uc2 There are two additional problems with studies of maternal cannabis use. Research is often based on reports by pregnant women -- instead of, say, tests of urine or the umbilical cord -- and they consistently underreport their use. (Researchers know of underreporting because samples reveal discrepancies.) And pregnant women who roll joints also tend to smoke tobacco or drink alcohol; it can be hard to tease out the risks of cannabis itself.\par \par \uc2 Few realize that THC is stored in fat and therefore can linger in a mother's body for weeks, if not months. It's not known whether the fetus's exposure is limited to the hours a woman feels high.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists\uc2  advises clinicians to ask pregnant women about marijuana use and to urge them to quit.\par \par \uc2 To find out whether that's happening, Dr. Judy Chang, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Pittsburgh\uc2 , and her colleagues recorded more than 450 first visits with pregnant patients.\par \par \uc2 Medical staff were more likely to warn patients that child protective services might be called if they used marijuana, the researchers found, than to advise them of potential risks. When mothers-to-be admitted to marijuana use, almost half of obstetric clinicians did not respond at all.\par \par \uc2 Pregnant women aren't eager to discuss it, either, because they are afraid of legal repercussions or a lecture.\par \par \uc2 Depression, anxiety, stress, pain, nausea and vomiting were the most common reasons women reported using marijuana in a 2014 survey of low-income mothers getting federal nutrition help in Colorado. Roughly 6 percent were pot users; a third were pregnant.\par \par \uc2 ''Women are thinking of this as medical marijuana in that they are treating some condition,'' said Elizabeth Nash, a policy analyst at the Guttmacher Institute who researches substance abuse in pregnancy.\par \par \uc2 ''If you're going to consider it like medicine,'' she said, ''then treat it like medicine and talk to your doctor about it.''\par \par \uc2 Stacey's son just had his first birthday. He's walking, talking and breast-feeding, and she isn't worried about his development.\par \par \uc2 She still smokes pot -- indeed, her son plays on a rug emblazoned with a marijuana leaf.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- When President Trump traveled to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware this week to pay respects to a fallen member of the Navy SEALs, it was his daughter Ivanka -- not his wife, Melania, who accompanied him.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. Trump's conspicuous absence at the solemn ceremony only underscored the fact that she vanished from public view days after her husband's swearing-in two weeks ago. And it raised new questions about what role, if any, she plans to play as first lady.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. Trump shattered decades of tradition when she decided last year that she would not move into the White House when her husband took office, and would remain instead in the family's lavish Manhattan penthouse so the couple's 10-year-old son, Barron, could finish the school year. That decision has made for an unusually slow transition into what has traditionally been a hectic, demanding and heavily scrutinized role.\par \par \uc2 It was not until Wednesday that she named Lindsay Reynolds, who worked in the White House under President George W. Bush, as her chief of staff, a position that most first ladies fill before Inauguration Day. Mrs. Trump has still not filled other crucial positions, including social secretary and communications director.\par \par \uc2 Unanswered requests for White House tours, traditionally run by the first lady's office, have been piling up by the thousands, according to people familiar with the process, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it. It is not clear how much planning has gone into the elaborate White House events that are among the heaviest tasks for first ladies, such as the annual Easter Egg Roll, which draws 35,000 attendees.\par \par \uc2 ''She is far behind the curve compared to where modern first ladies have been by the time their husbands are inaugurated, in a quite unprecedented way,'' said Myra Gutin, a professor at \uc2 Rider \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  who specializes in first ladies. ''We are in uncharted territory here.''\par \par \uc2 People close to Mrs. Trump say she has every intention of taking on a greater profile, though she is in no rush to establish a public presence. She is working behind the scenes to adjust to the job on her own terms, a task made infinitely more difficult by the implied comparison with \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2 . Despite her own deep ambivalence about the role, Mrs. Obama left it last month with a 68 percent approval rating and perhaps the most vaunted celebrity status ever enjoyed by a first lady.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. Trump's approval rating is 37 percent, according to a Gallup poll conducted last month, which found that she was substantially less popular than previous first ladies at the dawn of their husbands' presidencies. She is also considerably more of an enigma: One in four Americans were unfamiliar with or had no opinion of her. And Mrs. Trump is pushing back more forcefully on the traditional confines of her position than did Mrs. Obama, who after her husband's election in 2008 had badly wanted to remain in Chicago with her young daughters while they finished their school year. She was instructed by his political aides that the public would never accept such a move.\par \par \uc2 After announcing her chief of staff on Wednesday, Mrs. Trump on Thursday chose an interior designer, Tham Kannalikham, to overhaul the White House private quarters. In the coming days, she plans to announce the hiring of Natalie Jones, a former Obama administration protocol official, as her social secretary, according to people briefed on her plans, and Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, the former director of Fashion Week at Lincoln Center who planned Mr. Trump's inaugural festivities, as her senior adviser.\par \par \uc2 ''I am putting together a professional and highly experienced team, which will take time to do properly,'' Mrs. Trump said in a statement on Wednesday. ''I am excited to be organizing and bringing together such a dynamic and forward thinking group of individuals who will work together to make our country better for everyone.''\par \par \uc2 But for now, the lack of staff has deprived Mrs. Trump of control over her image, leading to speculation about everything from her state of mind to her moving date.\par \par \uc2 Her absence from Washington fueled rumors this week that she might never move to the capital. And with none of the customary images of the first lady adjusting to life in the White House, social media has seized instead on a meme based on video of Mrs. Trump frowning during the inauguration, spawning the hashtag #SadMelania.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Wolkoff said Mrs. Trump has every intention of moving to the White House and would be splitting her time between Washington and New York until then. ''It has only been a short time since the inauguration, and the first lady is going to go about her role in a pragmatic and thoughtful way that is unique and authentic to her,'' Ms. Wolkoff said.\par \par \uc2 The hiring of Ms. Reynolds appeared at least in part designed to answer concerns that have arisen about the unusually long disruption to White House tours. Ms. Reynolds said on Wednesday that she was ''working to ensure that the White House Visitors Office is fully staffed and operational and ready to accept tour requests for the public in the coming weeks after a traditional temporary closure during the transition period.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Reynolds also said that ''plans are in place'' for the Governors Ball, a black-tie event at the White House for the nation's governors at the end of the month. A spokeswoman said meetings to plan the Easter Egg Roll would take place over the next few weeks.\par \par \uc2 Anita McBride, who served as chief of staff to Laura Bush, said Mrs. Trump should have space to define her position in the way that felt most comfortable to her.\par \par \uc2 ''Everybody has expectations of what they think it should be, but the reality is it's really for the first lady to determine how she can fulfill the role that's true to her,'' Ms. McBride said. ''We're just used to seeing these announcements done before an inauguration and everybody in place on Day 1, but that doesn't mean it has to happen that way.''\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 's politics and Washington coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Melania Trump walked in the inaugural parade and vanished from public view shortly thereafter.

Known for his musically attentive dances, Mr. Alston, one of England's most celebrated modern dance makers, returns to the Peak Performances series at \uc2 Montclair State \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2 . The evening's centerpiece is the world premiere of his ''Chacony,'' with music played live by the Repast Baroque Ensemble and the Shanghai Quartet. Also on the program are three American premieres: ''An Italian in Madrid,'' featuring the young Kathak dancer Vidya Patel; ''Mazur,'' danced to seven of Chopin's Mazurkas; and ''Stronghold,'' by the company's associate choreographer, Martin Lawrance.\par \par \uc2 973-655-5112, peakperfs.org\par \par \uc2 BALLET DE LORRAINE at the Joyce Theater (Feb. 7-8, 7:30 p.m.; Feb. 9-10, 8 p.m.; Feb. 11, 2 and 8 p.m.; Feb. 12, 2 p.m.). As part of its first United States tour, this French troupe will stop at the Joyce with two eclectic programs. The first includes Alban Richard's ''HOK solo pour ensemble,'' in which 12 dancers move as one being; ''Devoted,'' a piece in pointe shoes, set to Philip Glass, by the adventurous duo Cecilia Bengolea and Fran\u231\'00\'E7ois Chaignaud; and, for a slice of modern dance history, Merce Cunningham's ''Sounddance,'' from 1975. The second program, ''Unknown Pleasures,'' is an experiment in anonymity, featuring the work of five choreographers whose identities go unrevealed. Guessing, of course, is permitted -- and part of the fun.\par \par \uc2 212-242-0800, joyce.org\par \par \uc2 DANCE ON CAMERA FESTIVAL at Lincoln Center (Feb. 3-7). This festival's 45th edition, presented by the Film Society of Lincoln Center and Dance Films Association, features new and archival films -- from an affectionate portrait of the American Ballet Theater star Marcelo Gomes to Martha Graham's 1957 treatise on her profession, ''A Dancer's World.'' Highlights include ''Storyboard P, a Stranger in Sweden,'' about that Brooklyn-born flex dancer's travels; two films made for TV (circa 1990) by the postmodern dance pioneer David Gordon; and ''In the Steps of \uc2 Trisha Brown\uc2 ,'' which traces the staging of Ms. Brown's seminal ''Glacial Decoy'' at Paris Opera Ballet.\par \par \uc2 212-875-5601, filmlinc.org\par \par \uc2 ANDREA KLEINE at \uc2 New York Live Arts\uc2  Theater (Feb. 9-11, 7:30 p.m.). The title of Ms. Kleine's latest project, ''My Dinner With Andrea: The Piece Formerly Known as Torture Playlist,'' refers to music used by the C.I.A. to torture prisoners. That subject was her starting point, but when it proved too bleak, she moved in a new direction. Drawing inspiration from the 1981 film ''My Dinner With Andr\u233\'00\'E9,'' Ms. Kleine reinvents its central dialogue about theater and life, pairing conversation with minimalist choreography in the vein of Lucinda Childs. She's joined by the dancers Alison Ingelstrom and Anya Liftig, as well as a musical trio performing Bobby Previte's original score.\par \par \uc2 212-924-0077, newyorklivearts.org\par \par \uc2 NEW YORK CITY BALLET\uc2  at David H. Koch Theater (through Feb. 26). This week brings one more chance to see the season's world premieres: ''The Times Are Racing,'' a ballet in sneakers by the company's acclaimed resident artist, Justin Peck; and ''The Shimmering Asphalt,'' by the Swedish choreographer and filmmaker Pontus Lidberg. They share a program on Saturday night with Peter Martins's ''Fearful Symmetries,'' a busy ballet to a bright John Adams score. George Balanchine's one-act ''Swan Lake'' returns on Saturday afternoon and Sunday, on a triple bill with his ''Allegro Brillante'' and ''The Four Temperaments.'' Another classic story ballet takes the stage on Wednesday, when Mr. Martins's ''Sleeping Beauty'' begins a two-week run.\par \par \uc2 212-496-0600, nycballet.com\par \par \uc2 MATTHEW ROGERS at JACK (Feb. 9-11, 8 p.m.; Feb. 12, 3 p.m.). Dancegoers may recognize Mr. Rogers from the work of Tere O'Connor, with whom he danced from 2004 to 2011. Having left New York for Europe a few years ago, he makes a welcome return with a solo of his own, ''a fragile son,'' presented at the Brooklyn performance space JACK as part of the dance series organized by Stacy Grossfield. The work brings together objects, text and movement gathered during his time in Slovakia and the Czech Republic, to explore themes of vulnerability and survival.\par \par \uc2 jackny.org\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020170203ed230005z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

This young artist from Recife, Brazil, asks tough questions about the country's colonial past and its supposedly race-blind present. His absorbing new film -- the hit of last year's S\u227\'00\'E3o Paulo Biennial, now on view in this museum's ground-floor gallery -- takes place along a river in Brazil's poorer, blacker northeast, where bare-chested fishermen perform a strange ritual with their catches: They cradle the animals to their chests, stroking their gills and kissing their craws as the life goes out of them. The ravishing film recalls the controversial history of European ethnographic cinema, but ''O Peixe'' is a slipperier fish than most: The ritual is an invention of Mr. de Andrade's. The artist's trickery around matters of race and anthropology is impressive, though you can ask whether Mr. de Andrade's steamy shots of these poor black workers' biceps and thighs actually achieves his critical goals, or just gives a majority-white art audience muscular bodies to gawk at.

This survey of tenacious, innovative, often beautiful work belatedly reveals its maker, now 90, as the queen of Arte Povera, the postwar Italian movement known for using humble materials. It runs from her early cut-aluminum ''Living Sculpture'' pieces to drawings, paintings and small sculptures of mostly female heads. Constant experimentation with materials, a disdain for traditional finish and some revenge on the male gaze emerge.

This is the second-largest gathering ever, anywhere, of prime Dickinson relics, and as such it comes with an aura the size of a city block. It instantly turns the Morgan into a pilgrimage site, a literary Lourdes, a place to come in contact with one aspect of America that truly can claim greatness. And the show has a mission, to give 21st-century audiences a fresh take on Dickinson. Gone is the white-gowned Puritan nun, and the Belle of Amherst, that infantilized charmer. At the Morgan we get a different Dickinson, a person among people: a member of a household, a village dweller, a citizen.

The International Center of Photography opened in 1974 as a showcase for socially concerned picture making, and has stayed on mission, even as photographic technology has expanded to encompass the internet. This exhibition reflects those shifts. It's as committedly topical as anything the center has done, with six thematic sections focused on climate change, immigration, gender issues, racial turmoil, terrorism and the 2016 presidential election. At the same time, is looks different from shows past as digital media -- smartphone videos, \uc2 Twitter\uc2  outtakes, \uc2 Instagram\uc2  feeds -- outnumber photographic prints.

Abstract Expressionism has had a lot of attention, but the New York art world of the 1950s was a complicated place of many barely tangent circles. It's badly in need of study, and now it's getting some in this labor-of-love exhibition. With nearly 230 objects, it has its share of stars. But it's far from a masterpiece display. It's something almost better: a view of typical -- rather than outstanding -- art, of familiar artists looking unfamiliar, and of strangers you're glad to meet. It looks the way history looks before the big museums get their sanitizing hands on it: funky, diverse, down to earth, with things to teach us about now.

These three artists are prime examples of transnational identity, having been born in China and educated in America, where they now live as artists and run an alternative space in New York called Practice. Here, at their first collaborative exhibition, they create the sense of an intimate conversation among a small, international group of friends. With sculpture, video, installation and a book of poetry, they defy expectations of what global art should look like, choosing to make intimate statements, rather than take on broad sociopolitical issues.

\par\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par {\*\bkmkstart toc60}{\*\bkmkend toc60}\b \uc2 Video of Sheep Slaughtering Ignites a Dispute\b0\par\par\uc2 By STEPHANIE STROM \par \uc2 1,510 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 February 2017\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Lamb inhabits a sleepy corner of the meat business in America, with far fewer sales than chicken, beef or pork and often raised by small producers. It is popular, however, among growing demographic groups like Latinos and Muslims, and some consumers who eat lamb because they believe the animals are raised more humanely, far from feedlots and the practices of large-scale meat production.\par \par \uc2 Now an animal rights group, Compassion Over Killing, has produced a video that it says shows repeated abuse of sheep at a California processing plant owned by the nation's largest lamb producer.\par \par \uc2 The approximately four-minute video was shot from May through November at a plant in Dixon, Calif., owned by Superior Farms, which sells to retail chains like \uc2 Walmart\uc2  and \uc2 Kroger\uc2 . It shows, among other things, a sheep struggling as a worker slices repeatedly at its carotid artery with a knife; some animals appear to continue breathing after their throats have been slit.\par \par \uc2 In another segment, a worker from a trucking company that delivers live animals to the plant repeatedly stabs an electric prod into a truck in an apparent effort to get the sheep inside to move. The video also shows workers changing ''best by'' dates on packages of lamb.\par \par \uc2 Compassion Over Killing said the video was shot by Scott David, a supporter who worked at the plant for seven months while surreptitiously filming various aspects of its operations. The group contends that the images show violations of the federal Humane Methods of Slaughter Act, which decrees that animals must be ''rendered insensible to pain'' before they are slaughtered.\par \par \uc2 ''We see a lot of ineffective stunning in the video because the animals are continuing to move after slaughter,'' said \uc2 Erica Meier\uc2 , the group's executive director.\par \par \uc2 The video also raises questions about Superior Farms's promise that all meat from the plant is butchered according to the Islamic rules of halal, or ritual slaughter.\par \par \uc2 The company said Wednesday that the video was another example of an animal rights group misconstruing normal slaughter practices, with which most people are unfamiliar. ''The video falsely alleges multiple violations'' of the slaughter law, the company said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 It said the stunning procedures seen in the video ensure that a sheep is ''absolutely insensitive to pain,'' and that the use of the knife seen in the video was appropriate for slicing the carotid arteries and jugular veins.\par \par \uc2 As for the changing of dates on packages, the company said labeling was often updated when new information was received or errors made. ''The packaging label changes shown in the video are not the result of any falsification of dates,'' it said.\par \par \uc2 It said it did not allow the use of prods in its operations, and would talk to its trucking company about the electric prod seen in the video.\par \par \uc2 Compassion Over Killing has sent its video to the \uc2 United States Department of Agriculture\uc2 , which inspects the plant and can shut it down for violations of the slaughter law. The department's \uc2 Food Safety and Inspection Service\uc2  ''is reviewing the video and will take appropriate action as necessary,'' Aaron Lavallee, a spokesman, wrote in an email. ''We take the safety of our food supply and the welfare of all animals seriously.''\par \par \uc2 The video shows a sheep being repeatedly stunned with a hand-held electronic device, a practice Mr. David said he saw several times. ''You can see them tense up as the stunner hits them,'' he said, ''then their head droops a bit, and then they often begin to struggle again when the workers try to lay them on the slaughter line.''\par \par \uc2 Lester Castro Friedlander, a former inspector for the department who volunteers with various animal rights groups, viewed the video and said it was clear that some of the animals were in pain when their throats were slashed or their tails were cut off.\par \par \uc2 The Humane Method of Slaughter Act requires that if an animal is stunned before slaughter, it must be immediately rendered unconscious. ''The stunned animal shall remain in a state of surgical anesthesia through shackling, sticking and bleeding,'' the law states.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Friedlander said he believed that ''the voltage probably wasn't high enough to adequately stun the animals. And I think they know that -- otherwise, why do they have an electrical stunner right next to the place where the animal is being bled out? You don't need that if the animal is properly stunned from the beginning.''\par \par \uc2 Americans eat less than a pound of lamb a year per capita, according to the Department of Agriculture. ''While more lamb is consumed each year, the increase is absorbed by the increase in population, causing consumption to be flat'' on a percentage basis, a department spokesman wrote in an email.\par \par \uc2 The department's data comes only from the facilities where it has inspectors; those plants, including the California one, process about 90 percent of the more than two million sheep slaughtered for meat.\par \par \uc2 They do not include state-inspected facilities or small, so-called custom slaughterhouses, which butcher animals brought to them by consumers or ranchers. Paul S. Kuber, an associate professor at Washington State \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  who formerly worked for Superior Farms, said a million or more sheep could be processed in such plants.\par \par \uc2 He said he saw nothing in the video that violated any food safety or animal welfare laws. ''The movement you see is part of the biochemical process the muscle goes through after death,'' Professor Kuber said. ''It's a natural process -- you'll sometimes see a carcass move hours after an animal is dead.''\par \par \uc2 The Superior Farms plant in Dixon operates under the section of the federal law that governs ritual slaughtering, and the meat produced there is certified halal.\par \par \uc2 Under halal rules, an animal cannot be dead before slaughter; slaughter must be accomplished with a single slash to the neck, and a prayer must be said before each animal is slaughtered, said Syed Farhat Quadri, the halal administrator and auditor for the Islamic Food and Nutrition Council of America.\par \par \uc2 ''We have to make sure the blood is drained completely before we start removing the ears or the head,'' Mr. Quadri said. ''There should not be any processing unless the animal is completely dead.''' So practices like cutting the tail of a live sheep are forbidden.\par \par \uc2 In the video, no prayers appear to be said as the worker slashes the animal's throat several times.\par \par \uc2 Anders Hemphill, director of marketing at Superior Farms, said in an email that the plant operates under ''a modified halal process'' overseen by a third-party halal certifier. ''This is to allow for proper humane treatment of the animals and also to ensure food safety,'' Mr. Hemphill wrote.\par \par \uc2 Temple Grandin, the noted animal welfare expert, last year narrated a video shot at the plant as part of the Glass Walls Project, an effort by the \uc2 American Meat Institute\uc2  to show consumers how animals are slaughtered. She said that typically, slaughter under halal rules was done ''with just a single cut. But every halal certifying agency is different and has different things it will accept.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. David said he was hired last May to work in the ''case ready'' department of the plant, where he and other workers labeled packages of lamb and put them in boxes for shipping.\par \par \uc2 He noticed that when products didn't ship as expected, his colleagues sometimes changed dates on packaging. One segment of the video shows workers pulling white ''best by'' stickers dated Sept. 28, 2016, from packages of lamb chops and replacing them with stickers dated Oct. 13, 2016.\par \par \uc2 Mr. David filmed more than a dozen instances in which when workers changed dates on packages of lamb.\par \par \uc2 No federal rule governs the dating of food, although the Agriculture Department last year set out to revamp its guidance on such labels, noting that they were confusing to consumers. Currently, the ''Best if Used By,'' ''Best if Used Before,'' and ''Sell By'' dates do not indicate the safety of any product other than baby formula.\par \par \uc2 In October, Mr. David was moved to the room where pelts are handled in Superior's Dixon plant. (Superior prides itself on wasting none of the animal, and its pelts are shipped to companies like the boot maker UGG.) ''That's where I first got access to film the live animals and how they're slaughtered,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. David said he saw Agriculture Department inspectors at the plant. ''You'd see them in the morning looking over lambs about to be slaughtered,'' he said. ''They didn't linger in the slaughter area; they mostly just passed through it.''\par \par \uc2 A shot from a four-minute video showing sheep being led to slaughter. The Department of Agriculture is reviewing the tape.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 \u226\'00\'E2\u8211\'20\'13\u160\'00\'A0 Senator \uc2 John McCain\uc2  steps in to assure Australia that the United States remains a stalwart ally after President Trump insulted its prime minister.\par \par \uc2 \u226\'00\'E2\u8211\'20\'13\u160\'00\'A0 Uproar over a ''technical fix'' to sanctions on Russian intelligence proves to be misplaced.\par \par \uc2 \u226\'00\'E2\u8211\'20\'13\u160\'00\'A0 \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2  helpfully offers to co-sponsor a bill promised from a Republican to require presidential candidates to submit to physical and mental health evaluations.\par \par \uc2 McCain steps into diplomatic vacuum to soothe allies\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump's blustery phone call with Australia's prime minister, \uc2 Malcolm Turnbull\uc2 , was enough to pull the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee into the diplomatic breach.\par \par \uc2 In a remarkable statement, Mr. McCain, Republican of Arizona, announced that he had called Australia's ambassador to the United States, Joe Hockey, to assure him of an ''unwavering support for the U.S.-Australia alliance.''\par \par \uc2 ''I asked Ambassador Hockey to convey to the people of Australia that their American brothers and sisters value our historic alliance, honor the sacrifice of the Australians who have served and are serving by our side, and remain committed to the safer, freer and better world that Australia does far more than its fair share to protect and promote.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump angrily berated Australia's prime minister after the leader pressed Mr. Trump to honor an agreement to accept 1,250 refugees from an Australian detention center. He then followed up with a \uc2 Twitter\uc2  post announcing his displeasure.\par \par \uc2 Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal! -- \uc2 Donald J. Trump\uc2  (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017\par \par \uc2 For Mr. McCain, a Vietnam War hero, that was too much, apparently.\par \par \uc2 ''On the Fourth of July, 1918, American and Australian soldiers fought side-by-side at the Battle of Hamel. In the century that followed, our two nations struggled and sacrificed together in World War I and World War II, Korea and Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq. Those of us who took part in the conflict remember well the service of more than 50,000 Australians in the Vietnam War, including more than 500 that gave their lives.\par \par \uc2 ''Today, Australia is hosting increased deployments of U.S. aircraft, more regular port visits by U.S. warships and critical training for U.S. Marines at Robertson Barracks in Darwin. This deepening cooperation is a reminder that from maintaining security and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region to combating radical Islamist terrorism, the U.S.-Australia relationship is more important than ever.\par \par \uc2 ''In short, Australia is one of America's oldest friends and staunchest allies. We are united by ties of family and friendship, mutual interests and common values, and shared sacrifice in wartime.''\par \par \uc2 A misplaced sanctions uproar\par \par \uc2 When word got out that the Trump Treasury Department has adjusted sanctions against the F.S.B., Russia's successor intelligence agency to the Soviet-era K.G.B., the response was predictable: President Trump had eased penalties on an intelligence agency that had intervened on his behalf in the election, critics screamed.\par \par \uc2 ''Russia attacked our democracy. It should be punished. Instead, President Trump is easing sanctions against its team of hackers, the F.S.B.,'' declared Representative Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California.\par \par \uc2 Not so fast.\par \par \uc2 The fix to the sanctions was initiated by career Treasury Department officials during the last days of the Obama administration and finalized on Thursday. And officials who remain at Treasury from the Obama days supported making the change.\par \par \uc2 The technical explanation is this: Apparently Russian border and customs officials are connected to the F.S.B., so theoretically, any visit to Russia that involves payment of a border tax is a violation of sanctions -- it would be material support to the F.S.B. That goes well beyond former President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's intent.\par \par \uc2 The adjustment keeps the sanctions focused on the intelligence unit of the agency.\par \par \uc2 ''I haven't eased anything,'' Mr. Trump told reporters as he was meeting with \uc2 Harley-Davidson\uc2  executives, and he was telling the truth.\par \par \uc2 Still, whatever the intention, Russian officials spun the move as a signal that the Trump administration was paving the way for improved relations with their government. The Russian news agency TASS described the move as an easing of sanctions against Moscow, and quoted Nikolai Kovalyov, the former head of the F.S.B., responding: ''This shows that actual joint work on establishing an anti-terrorism coalition is about to begin. This is the first step on the way leading to cooperation in the war on terror.''\par \par \uc2 Pelosi offers help with presidential mental health bill\par \par \uc2 Representative \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2  of California, the Democratic leader, on Thursday enthusiastically volunteered to cosponsor not-yet-written legislation addressing the president's physical, and mental, fitness, promised from an unlikely source: the Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee.\par \par \uc2 Allowing herself a brief tangent in her weekly press conference, Ms. Pelosi said she ''can't wait'' until the committee's chairman, Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah, introduces a promised bill that would require presidential and vice presidential candidates to submit to an independent medical examination.\par \par \uc2 ''I think it's a very good idea,'' Ms. Pelosi said, grinning.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Pelosi was referring to a recent remark that Mr. Chaffetz made to the \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 's editorial board, inserted at the end of a column about President Trump's ''erratic first week.''\par \par \uc2 In an interview Thursday, Mr. Chaffetz said his proposal, still in the development stages, would compel candidates to publicly release health details that might factor into a voter's decision on Election Day. It would include any medications they are taking, which could have side effects that impair their decision-making abilities, he said.\par \par \uc2 ''If you're going to have your hands on the nuclear codes and control our military, I think a basic health test would be appropriate,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 He denied that his idea targets Mr. Trump, saying it came to him because of questions raised during the campaign about \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 's health.\par \par \uc2 ''We compel them to do a financial disclosure,'' Mr. Chaffetz concluded. ''I think they should also do a medical disclosure.''\par \par \uc2 Of course, Mr. Trump never disclosed his tax returns either.\par \par \uc2 Trump plays \uc2 Twitter\uc2  defense again\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump does know how to please his audience.\par \par \uc2 The mainstream news media lit up Wednesday night with tales of Mr. Trump's call with Australia's prime minister, and his apparent suggestion that American forces might invade Mexico to get control of the drug trade.\par \par \uc2 Even conservatives were a bit taken aback.\par \par \uc2 Days like this I find myself in the fetal position muttering "President Pence. President Pence. Please God. President Pence." -- Erick Erickson (@EWErickson) February 2, 2017\par \par \uc2 The president was in turn defiant, bellicose and diversionary. Early Thursday morning, he joined the saber rattling of his national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, when he threatened Iran over a ballistic missile test that challenged a \uc2 United Nations Security Council\uc2  resolution that had called upon Tehran not to undertake such launches.\par \par \uc2 Iran has been formally PUT ON NOTICE for firing a ballistic missile.Should have been thankful for the terrible deal the U.S. made with them! -- \uc2 Donald J. Trump\uc2  (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017\par \par \uc2 Iran was on its last legs and ready to collapse until the U.S. came along and gave it a life-line in the form of the Iran Deal: $150 billion -- \uc2 Donald J. Trump\uc2  (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017\par \par \uc2 That was hardly his first salvo. He made no effort to shake the Australia story. He got the White House involved in a student riot at the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of California, Berkeley\uc2 , that forced the cancellation of an appearance by the Breitbart News editor Milo Yiannopoulos, a prominent figure in the white nationalist ''alt-right.''\par \par \uc2 If \uc2 U.C. Berkeley\uc2  does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view - NO FEDERAL FUNDS? -- \uc2 Donald J. Trump\uc2  (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017\par \par \uc2 And he claimed the presidential mantle by bringing up his unscheduled trip to Dover Air Force Base to greet the remains of an American commando killed in a raid in Yemen. He had been studiously silent before, saying he was respecting the wishes of the family of the deceased.\par \par \uc2 Attending Chief Ryan Owens' Dignified Transfer yesterday with my daughter Ivanka was my great honor. To a great and brave man - thank you! -- \uc2 Donald J. Trump\uc2  (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017\par \par \uc2 A fact-check for a presidential Iran tweet\par \par \uc2 So about Mr. Trump's Iran tweets.\par \par \uc2 Iran was hurting from international sanctions before the nuclear deal between Tehran and five world powers, including the United States, was concluded in July 2015. It was having a hard time finding customers for its oil, ports were closed to its ships and banking relationships were suspended.\par \par \uc2 But there was no evidence of imminent collapse.\par \par \uc2 And that $150 billion? It belonged to Iran but had been frozen. And it turned out not to be $150 billion, an extreme estimate. By most accounts from American government officials, it was south of $50 billion.\par \par \uc2 Trump picks a different kind of character to defend\par \par \uc2 Presidents define themselves by whom they defend.\par \par \uc2 Six months into his first term, President Obama -- answering a shouted question at a White House news conference -- stood up for Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. of Harvard after the African-American legal scholar and racial commentator was briefly arrested for disorderly conduct after trying to open the jammed lock on his own front door in Cambridge, Mass.\par \par \uc2 ''I think we know separate and apart from this incident is that there is a long history in this country of African-Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately. That's just a fact,'' Mr. Obama said -- and thus ensued an uproar over the president and the police that culminated in the July 30, 2009, ''Beer Summit'' between the president, Mr. Gates and the arresting officer, in a gesture of reconciliation.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday morning, Mr. Trump took to \uc2 Twitter\uc2  in defense of the First Amendment and Mr. Yiannopoulos -- who is known for his racially incendiary rants and a Florida speech he gave in the wake of last year's Orlando nightclub shooting titled ''Ten Things I Hate About Islam.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Yiannopoulos of Breitbart, the website once run by Mr. Trump's chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, was scheduled to speak at the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of California, Berkeley\uc2 , on Wednesday but canceled after 150 masked protesters set fires, tossed aside protective barricades, broke windows and hurled firecrackers at police officers.\par \par \uc2 That prompted an early morning \uc2 Twitter\uc2 -threat from Mr. Trump, who once offered to pay supporters' legal bills if they bashed protesters at his political rallies:\par \par \uc2 If \uc2 U.C. Berkeley\uc2  does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view - NO FEDERAL FUNDS? -- \uc2 Donald J. Trump\uc2  (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017\par \par \uc2 America First! Fed edition\par \par \uc2 Representative Patrick McHenry, Republican of North Carolina, wants the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  to stop talking about financial regulation with other countries, citing President Trump's dictum that the United States must put America first.\par \par \uc2 In a letter to Fed Chairwoman \uc2 Janet L. Yellen\uc2 , Mr. McHenry blasted the Fed's meetings with foreign regulators as unacceptable and unauthorized. He demanded that the Fed suspend such meetings until Mr. Trump names his own people to run the central bank.\par \par \uc2 ''It is incumbent upon all regulators to support the U.S. economy, and scrutinize international agreements that are killing American jobs,'' Mr. McHenry wrote. ''Accordingly the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  must cease all attempts to negotiate binding standards burdening American business until President Trump has had an opportunity to nominate and appoint officials that prioritize America's best interests.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. McHenry is vice chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, which oversees the Fed, but he does not appear well-versed in the relevant laws. The Fed's regulatory authority was not altered by Mr. Trump's election, and Mr. Trump cannot replace Ms. Yellen until her term ends in February 2018.\par \par \uc2 Ethics group petitions to open Puzder's divorce records\par \par \uc2 Andrew Puzder\uc2 's confirmation hearing to be the next secretary of labor appears to be in trouble, having been postponed four times as he tries to divest from the company he leads.\par \par \uc2 Adding to his troubles, an ethics watchdog group filed a petition on Wednesday to unseal court documents related to the divorce of Mr. Puzder.\par \par \uc2 In some of the sealed documents, Mr. Puzder's former wife, Lisa Fierstein, appears to have alleged that Mr. Puzder physically abused her.\par \par \uc2 The Washington-based group, the Campaign for Accountability, argued that the allegations are directly relevant to Mr. Puzder's nomination because the Labor Department is charged with assuring workers' physical safety.\par \par \uc2 ''If confirmed Mr. Puzder would be responsible for and oversee policy for millions of working American women,'' the group's executive director, Daniel Stevens, said in a statement. ''Before the Senate acts, the public has a right to know if Mr. Puzder abused his wife.''\par \par \uc2 George Thompson, a spokesman for Mr. Puzder, who is currently chief executive of the parent company of the fast food outlets Carl's Jr. and \uc2 Hardee's\uc2 , called the petition ''a shameless attempt to smear an individual who has shown nothing but dedication to creating jobs.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Puzder and Ms. Fierstein divorced in 1987, and the following year she filed a petition for damages, obtained by \uc2 Politico\uc2 , alleging physical abuse. In the legal wrangling over the petition, the two sides cited earlier documents, now sealed, that also allege abuse. A St. Louis County judge dismissed the petition, and Ms. Fierstein has since recanted her allegations.\par \par \uc2 Michael A. Kahn, a Missouri lawyer with experience in privacy rights cases, said a decision on the documents would hinge on the judge's assessment of whether there is ''good cause'' to unseal them. Mr. Kahn said the odds were long but that the allegations of abuse coupled with the high-profile position to which Mr. Puzder has been nominated could give the effort a ''toehold.''\par \par \uc2 Liberal group fires first salvo in ad war over Gorsuch\par \par \uc2 Let the Supreme Court advertising war begin.\par \par \uc2 A liberal advocacy group is beginning to run television ads against Mr. Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, with plans to target some states represented by moderate Democratic senators.\par \par \uc2 [Video: We The People Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 The ad, which includes a clip of a judicially robed man ripping the Constitution, is set to appear for one week in a dozen states, according to the group, People for the American Way. These include several states -- like North Dakota, West Virginia and Missouri -- that Mr. Trump carried easily in last year's election but that still have a Democratic senator.\par \par \uc2 Conservative groups have set off on a multimillion-dollar effort to support Judge Gorsuch that includes television advertising and planned events at megachurches. People for the American Way would not disclose the amount of money it was spending to run its ads.\par \par \uc2 Get politics and Washington news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and in the Morning Briefing newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020170203ed230005j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc62}{\*\bkmkend toc62}\b \uc2 Sprint to Repeal the Health Law Slows to a Crawl\b0\par\par\uc2 By ROBERT PEAR and REED ABELSON \par \uc2 1,336 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 February 2017\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- Congress's rush to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, once seemingly unstoppable, is flagging badly as Republicans struggle to come up with a replacement and a key senator has declared that the effort is more a repair job than a demolition.\par \par \uc2 ''It is more accurate to say 'repair Obamacare,''' Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and chairman of the Senate health committee, said this week. ''We can repair the individual market, and that is a good place to start.''\par \par \uc2 The struggles and false starts have injected more uncertainty into insurance markets that thrive on stability. An aspirational deadline of Jan. 27 for repeal legislation has come and gone. The powerful retirees' lobby AARP is mobilizing to defend key elements of the Affordable Care Act. Republican leaders who once saw a health law repeal as a quick first strike in the Trump era now must at least consider a worst case: unable to move forward with comprehensive health legislation, even as the uncertainty that they helped foster rattles consumers and insurers.\par \par \uc2 Insurers are threatening to exit the Affordable Care Act's market unless the Trump administration and Congress can quickly clarify their intentions: Will they support the existing public marketplaces, encourage people to sign up and keep federal assistance flowing to insurers, or not?\par \par \uc2 ''We need some certainty around the rules,'' said Dr. J. Mario Molina, chief executive of \uc2 Molina Healthcare\uc2 , which has been a stalwart in the Affordable Care Act market and is making money under the system.\par \par \uc2 ''We have a few months, but we don't have a lot of time,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 With the official end on Tuesday of what was supposed to be its final open enrollment season, the Affordable Care Act is looking more resilient than it seemed just a month ago. It will still be several days before final enrollment figures are released, and although a surge of last-minute signups failed to have materialize amid talk of repeal, early indications did not point to a collapse.\par \par \uc2 At their annual retreat last week, in Philadelphia, several congressional Republicans edged away from their powerful promise to ''repeal and replace'' the Affordable Care Act. It would, they said, be more accurate to say they intend to fix a law that they blame for the cancellation of many insurance policies, soaring premiums and a shrinking choice of health plans in many states.\par \par \uc2 Many Republicans say their resolve to dismantle the law, a central element of President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's legacy, is undiminished. ''We are looking to repeal this law, just like we told the voters we were going to do, just like we promised them we would do,'' said Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio and a leader of the House's most conservative wing. ''After all, there was an election where that was one of the most important issues.''\par \par \uc2 But after waging and winning many elections with a promise to kill it, Republicans still have no agreement on how to replace it. They will, they say, pursue a piecemeal approach because they have no desire to supplant the giant 2010 health law with a single comprehensive Republican plan cooked up in Washington.\par \par \uc2 When Congress convened this year, Republicans immediately introduced a budget resolution clearing the way for legislation to gut the health law, with strong support from Mr. Trump, who took office 17 days later. But Mr. Trump's rocky start has slowed the momentum, depleting his political capital and dimming prospects for bipartisan cooperation.\par \par \uc2 In addition, many senators are preoccupied with fights over the confirmation of Mr. Trump's nominees to the Supreme Court and top jobs in his administration. What was once considered Congress's Job No. 1 is being eclipsed for some lawmakers by more immediate matters.\par \par \uc2 Insurers say Republicans' mixed messages and slowing pace could send premiums soaring next year while making the market much less stable. The deadline to file rates for 2018 is this spring, and insurers say they need time to decide what kinds of plans to offer and to set prices.\par \par \uc2 ''We need stability and predictability,'' said Marilyn B. Tavenner, the chief executive of \uc2 America's Health Insurance Plans\uc2 , the main lobby for the industry.\par \par \uc2 Unless Congress continues cost-sharing subsidies, to reduce out-of-pocket costs for low-income people, and a reinsurance program, to help pay large claims, she said, more insurers will pull out of the market.\par \par \uc2 Insurers are also concerned about signs that the Trump administration may not enforce the so-called individual mandate, which requires people to have insurance or face a tax penalty. The penalty, or some way to encourage more participation, is seen as central to having enough young and healthy people sign up to keep premiums low.\par \par \uc2 ''It's very important to indicate how they are going to stabilize the market,'' said \uc2 Karen M. Ignagni\uc2 , the chief executive of EmblemHealth, who was instrumental in the development of the current law.\par \par \uc2 At the very least, analysts say the uncertainty for insurers could lead to much higher rates. ''2018 is a wild card,'' said Deep Banerjee, who follows insurers for \uc2 Standard & Poor's\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Many insurers could simply end up walking away, warned \uc2 Sabrina Corlette\uc2 , a research professor at Georgetown \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  who recently surveyed insurers about what they might do. ''At a certain point, you can't price high enough to account for that uncertainty,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 The end game is perhaps predictable. In the Senate, Republicans will need help from Democrats to replace the health law because they hold 52 seats but will need 60 votes. Several Republican senators, like Susan Collins of Maine and \uc2 Bob Corker\uc2  of Tennessee, say they will not vote to repeal the law unless they have a clear picture of what will replace it. And Democrats will not support any replacement unless Republicans scrap the idea of an outright repeal, which conservatives have been demanding for years.\par \par \uc2 ''We can't repair the roof while Republicans and the president are burning the house down,'' said Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington.\par \par \uc2 Republicans have many ideas about how to shore up insurance markets and lower costs. But it is highly unlikely that any of their proposals would be found by the \uc2 Congressional Budget Office\uc2  to insure as many people as the Affordable Care Act. Downbeat assessments from the budget office have doomed many proposals in the past, including the health care plan devised by Bill and \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  in 1993.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump chose Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia, to be his secretary of health and human services, with the expectation that he would work closely with Republicans in Congress on the details of a replacement plan. Democrats have delayed his confirmation, and that in turn has delayed Republican efforts to devise an alternative to the health care law they detest.\par \par \uc2 Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee voted on Wednesday to recommend confirmation of Mr. Price, overriding objections by Democrats, who boycotted the proceedings.\par \par \uc2 All of that turmoil in Washington has left insurers scrambling.\par \par \uc2 ''While the direction in Washington has been positive, we still need certainty about short-term fixes in order to determine the extent of our participation,'' Joseph R. Swedish, the chief executive of Anthem, one of the nation's largest insurers and a major player in the market, told investors on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Anthem said it expected to break even or make money selling individual coverage this year but said the market continued not to work as well as it could.\par \par \uc2 ''We have weighed in considerably, and continue to do so, with all the leadership in Congress,'' Mr. Swedish said.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 's politics and Washington coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Senator Lamar Alexander before a hearing on the health law.

SCOTT \par \uc2 1,230 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 February 2017\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 A few weeks ago, in reaction to something we had written about blackness and whiteness in recent movies, my colleague Manohla Dargis and I received a note from a reader. ''Since when is everything about race?'' he wanted to know. Perhaps it was a rhetorical question.\par \par \uc2 A flippant -- though by no means inaccurate -- answer would have been 1619. But a more constructive response might have been to recommend Raoul Peck's life-altering new documentary, ''I Am Not Your Negro.'' Let me do so now, for that reader (if he's still interested) and for everybody else, too. Whatever you think about the past and future of what used to be called ''race relations'' -- white supremacy and the resistance to it, in plainer English -- this movie will make you think again, and may even change your mind. Though its principal figure, the novelist, playwright and essayist James Baldwin, is a man who has been dead for nearly 30 years, you would be hard-pressed to find a movie that speaks to the present moment with greater clarity and force, insisting on uncomfortable truths and drawing stark lessons from the shadows of history.\par \par \uc2 To call ''I Am Not Your Negro'' a movie about James Baldwin would be to understate Mr. Peck's achievement. It's more of a posthumous collaboration, an uncanny and thrilling communion between the filmmaker -- whose previous work includes both a documentary and a narrative feature about the Congolese anti-colonialist leader Patrice Lumumba -- and his subject. The voice-over narration (read by Samuel L. Jackson) is entirely drawn from Baldwin's work. Much of it comes from notes and letters written in the mid-1970s, when Baldwin was somewhat reluctantly sketching out a book, never to be completed, about the lives and deaths of Medgar Evers, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr.\par \par \uc2 Reflections on those men (all of whom Baldwin knew well) and their legacies are interspersed with passages from other books and essays, notably ''The Devil Finds Work,'' Baldwin's 1976 meditation on race, Hollywood and the mythology of white innocence. His published and unpublished words -- some of the most powerful and penetrating ever assembled on the tortured subject of American identity -- accompany images from old talk shows and news reports, from classic movies and from our own decidedly non-post-racial present.\par \par \uc2 Baldwin could not have known about Ferguson and Black Lives Matter, about the presidency of \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  and the recrudescence of white nationalism in its wake, but in a sense he explained it all in advance. He understood the deep, contradictory patterns of our history, and articulated, with a passion and clarity that few others have matched, the psychological dimensions of racial conflict: the suppression of black humanity under slavery and Jim Crow and the insistence on it in African-American politics and art; the dialectic of guilt and rage, forgiveness and denial that distorts relations between black and white citizens in the North as well as the South; the lengths that white people will go to wash themselves clean of their complicity in oppression.\par \par \uc2 Baldwin is a double character in Mr. Peck's film. The elegance and gravity of his formal prose, and the gravelly authority of Mr. Jackson's voice, stand in contrast to his quicksilver on-camera presence as a lecturer and television guest. In his skinny tie and narrow suit, an omnipresent cigarette between his fingers, he imports a touch of midcentury intellectual cool into our overheated, anti-intellectual media moment.\par \par \uc2 A former child preacher, he remained a natural, if somewhat reluctant, performer -- a master of the heavy sigh, the raised eyebrow and the rhetorical flourish. At one point, on ''The Dick Cavett Show,'' Baldwin tangles with Paul Weiss, a Yale philosophy professor who scolds him for dwelling so much on racial issues. The initial spectacle of mediocrity condescending to genius is painful, but the subsequent triumph of self-taught brilliance over credentialed ignorance is thrilling to witness.\par \par \uc2 In that exchange, as in a speech for an audience of British \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2  students, you are aware of Baldwin's profound weariness. He must explain himself -- and also his country -- again and again, with what must have been sorely tested patience. When the students erupt in a standing ovation at the end of his remarks, Baldwin looks surprised, even flustered. You glimpse an aspect of his personality that was often evident in his writing: the vulnerable, bright, ambitious man thrust into a public role that was not always comfortable.\par \par \uc2 ''I want to be an honest man and a good writer,'' he wrote early in his career, in the introductory note to his first collection of essays, ''Notes of a Native Son.'' The disarming, intimate candor of that statement characterized much of what would follow, as would a reckoning with the difficulties of living up to such apparently straightforward aspirations. Without sliding into confessional bathos, his voice was always personal and frank, creating in the reader a feeling of complicity, of shared knowledge and knowing humor.\par \par \uc2 ''I Am Not Your Negro'' reproduces and redoubles this effect. It doesn't just make you aware of Baldwin, or hold him up as a figure to be admired from a distance. You feel entirely in his presence, hanging on his every word, following the implications of his ideas as they travel from his experience to yours. At the end of the movie, you are convinced that you know him. And, more important, that he knows you. To read Baldwin is to be read by him, to feel the glow of his affection, the sting of his scorn, the weight of his disappointment, the gift of his trust.\par \par \uc2 Recounting his visits to the South, where he reported on the civil rights movement and the murderous white response to it, Baldwin modestly described himself as a witness, a watchful presence on the sidelines of tragedy and heroism, an outsider by virtue of his Northern origins, his sexuality and his alienation from the Christianity of his childhood. But he was also a prophet, able to see the truths revealed by the contingent, complicated actions of ordinary people on both sides of the conflict. This is not to say that he transcended the struggle or detached himself from it. On the contrary, he demonstrated that writing well and thinking clearly are manifestations of commitment, and that irony, skepticism and a ruthless critical spirit are necessary tools for effective moral and political action.\par \par \uc2 ''I Am Not Your Negro'' is a thrilling introduction to his work, a remedial course in American history, and an advanced seminar in racial politics -- a concise, roughly 90-minute movie with the scope and impact of a 10-hour mini-series or a literary doorstop. It is not an easy or a consoling movie, but it is the opposite of bitter or despairing. ''I can't be a pessimist because I'm alive,'' Baldwin said. ''I'm forced to be an optimist.''\par \par \uc2 I Am Not Your Negro\par \par \uc2 Rated PG-13 for racial slurs and implied violence.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- After a Kansas man was convicted of possessing and sending child pornography, he appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit. The case came before a three-judge panel that included Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, who is now President Trump's Supreme Court nominee.\par \par \uc2 The Kansas man had been caught because an \uc2 AOL\uc2  system that scans outgoing emails for known images of child pornography detected such a file attached to a message he had sent. The \uc2 AOL\uc2  system forwarded the email to the \uc2 National Center for Missing and Exploited Children\uc2 , which opened it without a warrant and alerted law enforcement officials.\par \par \uc2 Citing the Fourth Amendment, Judge Gorsuch's panel overturned his conviction last August.\par \par \uc2 Writing for the panel, the judge expressed confidence that in the future, the center's ''law enforcement partners will struggle not at all to obtain warrants to open emails when the facts in hand suggest, as they surely did here, that a crime against a child has taken place.'' (He also left open the possibility of reinstating the evidence against the Kansas man after further proceedings.)\par \par \uc2 Although Judge Gorsuch has a decidedly conservative record on the bench, by at least one measure -- his view of the Fourth Amendment's protections against unreasonable searches -- he has been relatively moderate, according to legal scholars and a review of his rulings.\par \par \uc2 Orin S. Kerr, a George Washington \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  law professor who specializes in Fourth Amendment and technology issues, said Judge Gorsuch's opinions suggested that he was ''not a knee-jerk vote for the government.'' That is important, Mr. Kerr said, because the Supreme Court has yet to resolve many questions about how the Fourth Amendment applies to 21st-century communications.\par \par \uc2 ''The history of the Fourth Amendment is about physically breaking into houses and taking away papers, and the big question is how do you apply that physical concept to a virtual world,'' Mr. Kerr said. ''Courts are struggling with that, and there is a lot of wiggle room in how to do it.''\par \par \uc2 Underscoring how ambiguous constitutional law remains in this area, the Intercept website this week published a leaked version of an F.B.I. operational guide that revealed internal rules for emerging investigative technologies that raise Fourth Amendment issues. For example, the guide tells agents not to introduce in court evidence derived from using so-called Stingray devices to locate cellphones' owners, adding that their use to find people inside buildings ''could be deemed to constitute a search under the Fourth Amendment.''\par \par \uc2 ''There is, however, currently no specific decision on point,'' it said.\par \par \uc2 Since President George W. Bush appointed Judge Gorsuch to the 10th Circuit in 2006, the judge has dealt with several Fourth Amendment cases that raised novel technology issues. A 2013 case, for example, raised the question of what should happen if police officers erroneously stopped someone because of faulty technology, then discovered evidence of a crime.\par \par \uc2 In that case, an officer stopped a car because a license plate database, which was known to be unreliable, erroneously indicated that its plate was invalid. The officer then found drugs in the car. Writing for a unanimous panel, Judge Gorsuch suggested that the officer's use of the flawed technology made the search sufficiently unlawful to block prosecutors from using the drugs as evidence.\par \par \uc2 On other occasions, Judge Gorsuch has sided with the government in such cases, including one that arose in response to a 2012 Supreme Court ruling that police officers need warrants to monitor suspects' movements by attaching GPS trackers to their cars. The case before Judge Gorsuch presented the question of whether prosecutors could use evidence the police had gathered with such a GPS tracker in 2011, before the Supreme Court handed down its ruling.\par \par \uc2 In that case, Judge Gorsuch, again writing for a unanimous panel, held that prosecutors could use the evidence because the warrant rule for GPS trackers had not been clear at the time.\par \par \uc2 While there were several cases in which Judge Gorsuch ruled that a search had been unconstitutional, he has more often been part of a unanimous panel that sided with the government, a review of 10th Circuit cases showed.\par \par \uc2 Paul G. Cassell, a \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Utah law professor and a former Federal District Court judge, noted that the same was true for appellate judges across the ideological spectrum because people convicted of crimes routinely filed appeals even when there was scant legal question about the cases.\par \par \uc2 Even so, The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  identified three split decisions in which Judge Gorsuch ruled that officials accused of conducting illegal searches were immune from being sued, even though at least one other judge thought the plaintiffs deserved their day in court.\par \par \uc2 The Times also identified four split decisions about whether to suppress evidence obtained through searches that were alleged to be unconstitutional. In three of those cases, Judge Gorsuch argued that the evidence should not be suppressed, even though at least one other judge thought that it should be.\par \par \uc2 In the fourth, however, it was Judge Gorsuch who sided in dissent with a defendant. That case involved police officers who had walked onto private property and knocked on a door despite signs declaring ''no trespassing.'' Judge Gorsuch took a broader view of homeowner protections than his colleagues, writing that because of the signs, investigating officers should have gotten a warrant to walk onto the property.\par \par \uc2 Although such a rule would make the investigators' job slightly harder, he wrote, ''obedience to the Fourth Amendment always bears that cost and surely brings with it other benefits.''\par \par \uc2 ''Neither, of course, is it our job,'' he added, ''to weigh those costs and benefits but to apply the amendment according to its terms and in light of its historical meaning.''\par \par \uc2 Shima Baradaran Baughman, a \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Utah law professor, contended that the ''no trespassing'' case is important as a clue to Judge Gorsuch's Fourth Amendment philosophy because it suggests he will ''respect the founders' expansive views of the rights of the individual vis-\u224\'00\'E0-vis the state.''\par \par \uc2 ''Is this a liberal? No,'' said Sam Kamin, a \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Denver law professor. ''But given who is appointing him, this is someone who is willing to view government with skepticism -- not just with regard to business and regulation, but also with regard to searches conducted by law enforcement.''\par \par \uc2 Follow Charlie Savage on Twitter @charlie_savage.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 's politics and Washington coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and Twitter, and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Judge Neil M.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PARIS -- The cover of Paris Match magazine late last year featured a handsome, 30-something man strolling arm in arm with an attractive blond woman in her 60s. The same couple were on the cover of a summer issue, holding hands at the beach, and on a spring edition dressed up for a state dinner.\par \par \uc2 As France gears up for presidential elections in April (and probably a runoff in May), this unusual pair could help prevent it from becoming the next country to succumb to xenophobic populism. He's the upstart presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron, and she's his former high school French teacher, Brigitte Trogneux, now his close adviser and wife.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Macron, the 39-year-old former economy minister, is now in second place in the polls. He surged past the conservative Fran\u231\'00\'E7ois Fillon this week thanks to ''Penelope-gate'' -- an investigation into whether Mr. Fillon's Welsh-born wife held a well-paid government job but didn't actually work, and other allegations.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Macron still lags the front-runner, Marine Le Pen, who wants France to slash immigration and leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2 . Mr. Macron is adamantly pro-Europe and quickly opposed President Trump's barring of refugees. Polls show that Mr. Macron would easily defeat Ms. Le Pen in a runoff.\par \par \uc2 He's benefiting from a global election season in which voters want to break with conventions. On one hand Mr. Macron is an \u233\'00\'E9narque -- a graduate of ENA, France's elite finishing school for future presidents and ministers -- and worked as an investment banker before quickly rising in the Socialist Party. But last year he broke away from the ruling (and ailing) Socialists to form his own centrist party, which he claims is neither left nor right. His youth adds to his novelty.\par \par \uc2 And his unconventional personal story keeps him from seeming like just another ambitious \u233\'00\'E9narque. Mr. Macron and his wife met when he was a 15-year-old 10th grader at a Jesuit high school in Amiens, and Ms. Trogneux was a 40-year-old married mother of three children, one of whom was in Mr. Macron's class. Then known by her married name, Auzi\u232\'00\'E8re, she taught French literature and ran the theater club.\par \par \uc2 By all accounts Mr. Macron was precocious: an accomplished pianist who excelled academically and starred in the school play, which Ms. Trogneux directed. (While minister, he recited Moli\u232\'00\'E8re from memory on French TV.) ''Resolutely, he wasn't like the others. He was always with the teachers,'' Ms. Trogneux said in the French documentary ''Emmanuel Macron: The Meteor Strategy.'' ''He wasn't an ado'' -- an adolescent -- she added.\par \par \uc2 Their relationship turned romantic when Mr. Macron, then in 11th grade, persuaded her to write a play with him. ''Writing brought us together every Friday and it unleashed an incredible closeness,'' she told Paris Match.\par \par \uc2 At the insistence of either his alarmed parents or the frazzled Ms. Trogneux, Mr. Macron left to spend his senior year in Paris at the prestigious Lyc\u233\'00\'E9e Henri-IV. Before leaving home, he reportedly promised his teacher: ''You won't get rid of me. I will return and I will marry you.''\par \par \uc2 Over long phone calls from Paris, ''little by little, he vanquished my resistance,'' she said. Ms. Trogneux eventually divorced her husband and took a teaching job in Paris. ''I told myself: I'm going to miss out on my life if I don't do this.''\par \par \uc2 At their 2007 wedding, Mr. Macron thanked Ms. Trogneux's children for accepting him and said the pair are ''not at all a normal couple -- though I don't like that adjective much -- but we're a couple that exists.''\par \par \uc2 Its existence has caused some flack. A radio humorist recently called the long-legged Ms. Trogneux a ''menopausal Barbie.'' Critics call Mr. Macron a ''chouchou'' -- a kind of teacher's pet -- who's jumping the line for the presidency and flaunting his personal life to win votes.\par \par \uc2 But the French press is frequently admiring of their relationship. Magazines call her a fashion icon and run pictures of the youthful Mr. Macron giving a baby bottle to one of his seven step-grandchildren.\par \par \uc2 It helps that -- although their romance began when Mr. Macron was scandalously young -- once students reach \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2 , student-teacher flings are practically expected. The twist, in Mr. Macron's case, is that they're still together decades later.\par \par \uc2 And true love excuses many breaches of convention here. Last fall's main literary event was ''Letters to Anne,'' a 1,276-page book of romantic letters that former President Fran\u231\'00\'E7ois Mitterrand sent to his longtime mistress, Anne Pingeot. They met when she was 19 and he was 45. (''I feel that I've been making love to you without stopping since August 15, 1963!'' Mr. Mitterrand declared in a letter dated seven years later.)\par \par \uc2 The French also pride themselves on not moralizing. Politicians' private lives don't have to follow a script, and no one even expects them to discuss it. Marine Le Pen has two ex-husbands and took years to acknowledge her current relationship with another party official.\par \par \uc2 But don't confuse a lack of moralizing with a lack of interest. One sign that President \uc2 Fran\u231\'00\'E7ois Hollande\uc2 's career was kaput was that no one cared anymore about whom he was sleeping with. The Socialists are running Mr. Hollande's former education minister for president instead; he's currently in distant fourth place in the polls.\par \par \uc2 The one requirement is that a politician's love life should be sincere, especially if it's part of his public persona. Mr. Macron went on TV in November to deny a persistent rumor that he's secretly gay and living a ''double life.'' At issue isn't his sexuality; it's his authenticity. The implication is that if his love story isn't real, his plans for the country lack substance, too.\par \par \uc2 For the future of France, let's hope it is.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Pamela Druckerman is the author of ''Bringing Up B\u233\'00\'E9b\u233\'00\'E9: One American Mother Discovers the Wisdom of French Parenting'' and a contributing opinion writer.\par \par \uc2 The French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte Trogneux, arriving at a state dinner last March.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- Community groups in Michigan and Minnesota have decided to reject hundreds of thousands of dollars in federal aid to fight violent extremism because of what they call the Trump administration's vilification of Muslims.\par \par \uc2 Last month, the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 , under the Obama administration, awarded $10 million in grants to more than two dozen community groups and cities for programs to counter recruitment efforts by terrorist and white supremacist groups.\par \par \uc2 The group in Minnesota decided to reject the money after Trump administration officials were reported to be considering reshaping the program to target only Muslims. The effort, now known as Countering Violent Extremism, or C.V.E., would be renamed Countering Radical Islamic Extremism, Reuters reported on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 That group, Ka Joog, which works with Somali youths in Minneapolis, said in a statement that its board had decided not to take the nearly $500,000 it was awarded last month because it believed that its efforts had ''been hindered by the Trump administration to instill fear, uncertainty and anti-Muslim sentiments.''\par \par \uc2 The Michigan group, Leaders Advancing and Helping Communities, in Dearborn, said it would also reject $500,000 in federal aid. Suehaila Amen, an executive board member, said that her group had already been discussing before the Reuters report came out whether to accept the grant, because some in the community see the hotly disputed program as a way to spy on Muslims. But the decision was sealed by Mr. Trump's statements and actions, Ms. Amen said.\par \par \uc2 ''You're talking about a president who has maligned the Muslims throughout the entire campaign,'' she said. ''We don't feel like we need to compromise our integrity, transparency and integrity in the community for some money or funding.''\par \par \uc2 Another organization, the Muslim Public Affairs Council Foundation, which has offices in Washington and Los Angeles, said it was waiting to see whether the administration moved forward with changes to the program before deciding whether to keep its nearly $400,000 grant.\par \par \uc2 And Jihad Turk, the president of Bayan Claremont, a graduate college in Claremont, Calif., for Muslim scholars and religious leaders, said it would not accept its $800,000 grant, one of the largest awarded, if the administration renamed the program and entirely shifted its focus.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  declined to comment, though people briefed on the matter said there was fierce resistance inside the department to making changes to the program that could further alienate Muslim communities assisting antiterrorism efforts. During his confirmation hearing as department secretary last month, John F. Kelly stressed the need to build trust with Muslim communities.\par \par \uc2 But the administration's possible move aligns with Mr. Trump's campaign promises to defeat what he called ''radical Islamic terrorism,'' as well as with the views of some of his advisers. Stephen K. Bannon, the president's top strategist, has said that Islam is not a religion of peace, while Mr. Trump's national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, once said that fear of Muslims was rational.\par \par \uc2 Counterterrorism experts say that the administration risks eroding years of bridge building between the government and Muslim communities, which have long been suspicious of the counterextremism programs.\par \par \uc2 ''Going forward, Muslim communities may fear that information provided for C.V.E. programs and target audiences will be used instead for surveillance, prosecution and/or deportation,'' said J. M. Berger, a fellow with the International Center for Counter-Terrorism in The Hague and co-author of ''ISIS: The State of Terror.'' ''Those fears may now be justified.''\par \par \uc2 Erroll G. Southers, director of homegrown violent extremism studies at the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Southern California\uc2 , said a singular focus on Muslim extremism would offer only a partial picture of violence in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Since the Sept. 11 attacks, the number of killings in the United States by white supremacists, antigovernment fanatics and other homegrown extremists has been comparable to that of Islamic terrorists. From 2009 to 2016, according to figures from the \uc2 Anti-Defamation League\uc2 , these groups accounted for 84 percent of the extremist violence in which shots were exchanged with law enforcement.\par \par \uc2 ''Data should dictate policy,'' Mr. Southers said. ''If you ignore data, you ignore the real problem, which is that extremism comes from a diverse range of sources.''\par \par \uc2 The federal programs have prompted a heated debate among Muslim scholars and activists, with civil rights groups such as the \uc2 Council on American-Islamic Relations\uc2  saying they stigmatize entire communities.\par \par \uc2 In Minneapolis, some groups have participated in a program run by the local United States attorney to counter Islamic State propaganda efforts directed at Somalis. But other groups have criticized the government's efforts, saying they are overwhelmingly focused on potential extremism within Muslim communities and pay little attention to the threats posed by white nationalists and other right-wing extremists.\par \par \uc2 Faiza Patel, a co-director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice at the \uc2 New York \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  School of Law, said the proposed change to the Countering Violent Extremism Program would make a bad project worse.\par \par \uc2 ''It makes explicit what was already implied in C.V.E.,'' she said. ''Now all of that window dressing goes out the door.''\par \par \uc2 Despite millions of dollars in government-sponsored research, there remains no consensus on why someone becomes a terrorist or how to identify such people before they attack.\par \par \uc2 Clark R. McCauley Jr., a professor of psychology at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania who has conducted government-funded terrorism research for years, said that programs to counter extremism were already too focused on Islamic terrorism. ''It's not all that easy to get money to study right-wing stuff,'' he said. ''There's a big oversupply of attention to Islamic extremism as it is.''\par \par \uc2 Making that focus more explicit may not significantly change how the programs operate, he said. ''But what it will mean for Muslims in the U.S., that's going to be a problem, even if the machinery doesn't change,'' Professor McCauley said. ''It means the country has decided to say, 'You people are a special threat.'''\par \par \uc2 Christian Picciolini, the founder of Life After Hate, a Chicago group devoted to countering right-wing extremism, said it would be dangerous to minimize white extremism, pointing to gunmen like Dylann S. Roof, who killed nine people at an African-American church in Charleston, S.C., in 2015, and Wade Michael Page, who killed six people at a Wisconsin Sikh temple in 2012.\par \par \uc2 ''They are being radicalized by fake news and conspiracy theories,'' he said of such attackers. ''We are ignoring a massive domestic terrorism problem that already exists in our borders.''\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 's politics and Washington coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Suehaila Amen said anti-Muslim statements by President Trump had persuaded the group she works with to reject federal aid.

The Biggest Winners of Snap's I.P.O.\b0\par\par\uc2 By KATIE BENNER and MICHAEL J. de la MERCED \par \uc2 658 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 February 2017\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 7\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 One of the more reliable paths to becoming a billionaire over the past 20 years has been to build a dominant technology company and then to take it public. That trend has led to \uc2 Google\uc2  billionaires, \uc2 Facebook\uc2  billionaires and a whole class of mere multimillionaires too.\par \par \uc2 So who will be the ones to walk away the wealthiest from the coming public offering of Snap, the parent company of the social media app Snapchat?\par \par \uc2 The answers came into view on Thursday when Snap made its initial public offering prospectus publicly available. The filing revealed some of the individuals and investors who have the most to gain from a successful market debut. We calculated the value of their stakes based on the fair market value of a share of Snap at the end of last year, when it was $16.33.\par \par \uc2 Here are some of the winners:\par \par \uc2 EVAN SPIEGEL Mr. Spiegel, 26, was a founder of the company and now serves as Snap's chief executive and is a member of the board. According to the prospectus, he owns 227 million shares of the company, a stake that was worth $3.7 billion at the end of last year.\par \par \uc2 His regular compensation package was nothing to sniff at either. In 2016, he was paid $2.6 million, including $503,205 in base salary, a $1 million bonus and $901,635 in other compensation, which covered his $890,339 personal security budget.\par \par \uc2 BOBBY MURPHY\uc2  Mr. Murphy, 28, helped found Snapchat when he and Mr. Spiegel were fraternity brothers at \uc2 Stanford \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Mr. Murphy is now Snap's chief technology officer and a member of the board.\par \par \uc2 Like Mr. Spiegel, Mr. Murphy owns 227 million shares of the company, which were worth $3.7 billion at the end of last year.\par \par \uc2 IMRAN KHAN Mr. Khan, 39, is a former investment banker who is now Snap's chief strategy officer. Mr. Khan owns 2.8 million shares of Snap, which were worth more than $46 million at the end of last year.\par \par \uc2 In 2016, Mr. Khan was paid a salary of $241,539 and a bonus of $5.2 million, as well as additional stock compensation of $14,658.\par \par \uc2 TIMOTHY SEHN Mr. Sehn, 36, is Snap's senior vice president of engineering. He owns almost 7 million shares of Snap, which were worth $110 million at the end of last year.\par \par \uc2 In addition, Mr. Sehn's 2016 base salary was $400,152 and his bonus was $1 million. He received a $40 million stock award last year as well.\par \par \uc2 BENCHMARK Benchmark, widely regarded as a premier Silicon Valley venture capital firm, invested in Snap in 2013 when the start-up was still known as Snapchat and was valued at $60 million to $70 million. The investment was spearheaded by a Benchmark partner, \uc2 Mitch Lasky\uc2 , who sits on Snap's board.\par \par \uc2 According to Snap's prospectus, Benchmark owns 131.6 million shares of the company, a stake that was worth $2.1 billion at the end of last year.\par \par \uc2 LIGHTSPEED VENTURE PARTNERS Lightspeed was the first venture investor in Snap back in 2012, a year after Snapchat was launched. Jeremy Liew, a Lightspeed venture capitalist, led the investment.\par \par \uc2 So how has that bet fared? According to Snap's prospectus, \uc2 Lightspeed\uc2  owns 86.6 million shares of the company, which were valued at $1.4 billion at the end of last year.\par \par \uc2 MICHAEL LYNTON\uc2  Mr. Lynton, 57, the former chief executive of Sony's entertainment division, has long been a mentor to Mr. Spiegel. He announced last month that he would be leaving \uc2 Sony\uc2  to focus on Snap as a director and chairman of the board. Mr. Lynton owns 3 million shares of Snap, which were worth $49.3 million at the end of last year.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020170203ed230004o\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par {\*\bkmkstart toc68}{\*\bkmkend toc68}\b \uc2 Uncertainty at \uc2 Clinton Foundation\uc2  in Trump Era\b0\par\par\uc2 By STEVE EDER, SHERI FINK and AMY CHOZICK \par \uc2 1,578 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 February 2017\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 20\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Last summer, former President \uc2 Bill Clinton\uc2  pledged that if \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  won the presidential election, he would avoid conflicts by stepping aside from many of his duties at the \uc2 Clinton Foundation\uc2 , restricting foreign donations to the charity and spinning off certain programs.\par \par \uc2 Now, nearly three months after Mrs. Clinton's defeat, the foundation is still grappling with its place in the era of President Trump. It faces some daunting challenges: a drop in fund-raising during the campaign; uncertainty about the scale of the former president's ambitions; and questions about leadership, including how long its president, \uc2 Donna E. Shalala\uc2 , will stay, and whether Mrs. Clinton might rejoin the charity.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Clinton, in a letter to be released with the foundation's annual report this week, went so far as to ask supporters for advice on its future. ''We seek both your input and your ideas,'' he wrote, noting that the organization would work to expand its impact.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Shalala, in an interview on Thursday, acknowledged the difficulties. ''Last year was a tough year,'' she said, ''because people were beating on us with nonsense,'' a reference to bruising political attacks claiming that donors were using the foundation to curry favor with the Clintons.\par \par \uc2 Revenues were down for 2016, Ms. Shalala acknowledged, in part because of voluntary restrictions and the fact that the charity's major fund-raisers -- the former president and his daughter, Chelsea -- were campaigning for Mrs. Clinton. Revenues ''dropped during the economic downturn, too,'' Ms. Shalala said.\par \par \uc2 Still, both Mr. Clinton and Ms. Shalala, who also cited concerns in keeping talent, expressed optimism. ''At the end of the day,'' she said, ''I think this is going to be as it always was: a creative, dynamic foundation that helps to improve the lives of millions.''\par \par \uc2 As the foundation looks within, many experts said it was right to assess its future, including whether a great enough need still existed for its most prominent asset: the ability to bring the private sector together with charities to help underserved causes.\par \par \uc2 ''It's certainly a different landscape than it was'' when the foundation's work began, said Carolyn Miles, president and chief executive of \uc2 Save the Children\uc2 , one of the foundation's early partners. ''I would say you have to come back as something slightly different.''\par \par \uc2 In recent weeks, the foundation has completed a planned shutdown of the Clinton Global Initiative, which hosted a high-profile annual meeting, and laying off most of the initiative's staff of about 100. Foundation officials confirmed on Thursday that two major programs, including one in Haiti, would transfer out of the foundation.\par \par \uc2 The organization has also considered scaling back other efforts, according to several people familiar with the discussions, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Staff members have prepared options for Bill and \uc2 Chelsea Clinton\uc2  to consider, which include some new endeavors, Ms. Shalala said.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, foundation officials are striving to project an image of business as usual. The new annual report highlighted the organization's efforts across the world, including opening a health clinic in Malawi and expanding its role in countering the opioid crisis in the United States. During the holidays, Mr. Clinton reached out to donors offering to match year-end contributions. \uc2 Chelsea Clinton\uc2  and foundation staff members in January packed grapefruits at a community service event in New York with City Harvest. And Ms. Shalala announced a new partnership to enhance the health of children in San Diego County.\par \par \uc2 President Trump's executive order banning federal assistance for international health groups if they counsel women on or provide abortions has also contributed to fears of a broader decline in funding for global health work. Ms. Shalala said she had discussed how to contend with that possibility in a recent conversation with \uc2 Bill Gates\uc2 , whose charity has supported the \uc2 Clinton Foundation\uc2  and many other nonprofits.\par \par \uc2 The foundation was formed in 1997 during Mr. Clinton's presidency and has raised roughly $2 billion since then. Its work has spanned 3,500 projects and 180 countries including the United States, with projects as varied as earthquake recovery in Haiti and health initiatives in Rwanda.\par \par \uc2 During the presidential campaign, political opponents pounded the foundation, criticizing its dealings with foreign donors and financiers. No evidence emerged of a quid pro quo while Mrs. Clinton served as secretary of state, but the overlapping interests of foreign donors to the foundation and official international affairs dogged her candidacy.\par \par \uc2 The philanthropy was a focus for Mrs. Clinton after her time as secretary of state and before her recent presidential run. In terms of deciding whether to re-engage, ''we are not there yet even remotely now,'' Nick Merrill, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, said.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Shalala, who served as secretary of health and human services under Mr. Clinton and seemed destined for a White House role if Mrs. Clinton had prevailed, said it was unclear how long she would stay as the foundation's president. For the moment, hiring appears muted: Most of the job postings on the foundation's website are for food service and catering jobs at the \uc2 Clinton Presidential Center\uc2  in Little Rock, Ark.\par \par \uc2 Many believe the foundation's future will depend on Mr. Clinton, now 70, always its driving force. ''Does he still have the energy, passion, desire and the good health in order to devote energy to it?'' Neal Keny-Guyer, the chief executive of the global humanitarian organization Mercy Corps, asked during a phone interview from Davos, Switzerland, during the \uc2 World Economic Forum\uc2  in January.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, Ms. Shalala described the former president and \uc2 Chelsea Clinton\uc2 , who both serve on the foundation's board, as engaged, ''main influences'' on decision-making, with Mr. Clinton still a draw for donors. ''He's got a lot of friends,'' Ms. Shalala said.\par \par \uc2 But others saw obstacles ahead.\par \par \uc2 ''The big issue they are going to face is to what degree can they raise money now that the Clintons seem to be out of national leadership positions,'' said \uc2 Leslie Lenkowsky\uc2 , a philanthropy expert at \uc2 Indiana \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2 . ''They have lost a little bit of their luster.''\par \par \uc2 In 2015, the charity's revenues were nearly $300 million, down from $338 million in 2014, according to its annual report. It has not yet released figures for 2016, but Ms. Shalala acknowledged that they were lower. Internal goals of raising $20 million in unrestricted funds in 2016 were surpassed, but ''took a lot of effort to get there,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 In August, at the official start of the general election campaign, the foundation announced its decision to shutter the Clinton Global Initiative, a yearly gathering that Douglas J. Band, a longtime aide of Mr. Clinton's, had conceived of as a way to connect wealthy donors and corporations with worthy causes. It held its final meeting in September.\par \par \uc2 By contrast, the Clinton Health Access Initiative, known as CHAI -- a separate but affiliated entity -- halted a series of moves designed to disengage from the Clintons in the event that Mrs. Clinton won the White House.\par \par \uc2 Regan Lachapelle, a spokeswoman for CHAI, said the group's work was continuing amid discussions about its future.\par \par \uc2 ''None of it's resolved,'' said \uc2 Dr. Paul Farmer\uc2 , a board member of CHAI, which has health programs in 70 countries that include promoting AIDS treatment and strengthening health systems, in a telephone interview from Haiti. ''Knowing what to do in this climate is a tough call.''\par \par \uc2 Across the worldwide outposts where the \uc2 Clinton Foundation\uc2  has a presence, speculation about its future has been rampant. In some foreign countries, CHAI has been accused of using the Clintons' influence to pressure governments into pursuing certain initiatives, or rewarding favored American development partners.\par \par \uc2 ''If they disappear it would be very ironic,'' said Dr. Patricia A. McQuilkin, an associate professor of pediatrics at the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Massachusetts Medical School.\par \par \uc2 Speaking from Liberia, she said CHAI's initiatives in the wake of the Ebola epidemic had sidelined longtime academic partnerships like hers. ''They insinuate themselves into the whole process and try to take it over,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Development experts, including Daniel F. Runde, a former director of the Office of Global Development Alliances at the United States Agency for International Development, generally expressed the belief that the foundation could continue to attract support for its work.\par \par \uc2 ''It's a damaged brand,'' Mr. Runde said, ''but there remains an international demand for them.''\par \par \uc2 For years, the \uc2 Clinton Foundation\uc2  has worked with organizations founded by other former presidents, from Lyndon B. Johnson to George W. Bush. In recent months, Ms. Shalala said, foundation officials have offered advice for former President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  and his wife, Michelle, on their own foundation, which will focus on national and international community building programs. ''They called and asked some questions,'' Ms. Shalala said.\par \par \uc2 Follow Steve Eder, Sheri Fink and Amy Chozick on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 From top: Hillary Clinton and Melinda Gates at the inaugura- tion of a global partnership on maternal and child health in 2011; former President Bill Clinton greeting children at a hospi- tal in the Dominican Republic in 2007; and Chelsea Clinton helping volunteers prepare free medical kits in 2015.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PENANG, Malaysia -- How does he do it? How does Prime Minister \uc2 Najib Razak\uc2  of Malaysia stay in power despite allegations that he embezzled $1 billion from a sovereign wealth fund?\par \par \uc2 Corruption is nothing new here, but the scale and implications of the \uc2 1Malaysia Development Berhad\uc2  (1MDB) affair are staggering. It may be the world's largest money-laundering scandal involving a sitting head of government. The case is being investigated by authorities in at least six foreign states, including the \uc2 U.S. Justice Department\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Yet there's been no mutiny within Mr. Najib's party, no vote of censure in Parliament, no mass protests. In both 2015 and 2016, tens of thousands of supporters of Bersih, an electoral-reform movement, took to the streets calling for Mr. Najib's resignation. But the demonstrations don't seem to have loosened his grip on his party, the United Malays National Organization, nor UMNO's grip on Malaysia: UMNO has been governing the country in coalition governments for six decades.\par \par \uc2 Mahathir Mohamad, a former prime minister and former mentor of Mr. Najib who recently left UMNO, blames the political stagnation on personal patronage -- or what he calls ''animal feed.'' Others blame it on disarray within the opposition, an uneasy assemblage of parties representing different ethnic and religious interests.\par \par \uc2 But both explanations place too much emphasis on agency among the elites and too little on structural causes.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Najib remains in power because Malaysia has become an electoral one-party state and because UMNO has captured the Muslim-Malay majority by peddling communalism under the guise of promoting equality. The opposition has yet to find an alternative model on which to build a sustainable coalition for change.\par \par \uc2 In 1969, after UMNO suffered an unprecedented electoral setback, Muslim Malays' longstanding grievances about their economic marginalization, a byproduct of British colonialism, devolved into widespread riots between the Malay majority and the Chinese minority. Two years of emergency rule followed.\par \par \uc2 Abdul Razak Hussein, the first prime minister after the riots (and Mr. Najib's father), approached multiparty democracy with great cynicism. He co-opted opposition groups into the governing coalition. He permanently abolished local elections, which had previously put opposition parties in charge of municipalities and given them standing to challenge the federal government's authority. And his government tightened the sedition law to ban discussion of sensitive communal issues.\par \par \uc2 Most important, Mr. Razak introduced the New Economic Policy, a nativist plan to restructure the economy, then dominated by local ethnic Chinese and foreign capital. Muslim Malays and indigenous peoples of Borneo, together known as bumiputera, were given preferential access to education, employment, equity and homeownership. These groups soon came to dominate the fast-expanding bureaucracy and state enterprises.\par \par \uc2 The policy was a masterful move by UMNO to lock in support from Muslim-Malay voters, as well as fend off competition from the Islamist party Pas.\par \par \uc2 The system was reinforced under Mr. Mahathir's rule, from 1981 to 2003. His government substantially privatized the economy, producing a new bumiputera capitalist class and more patronage networks. Mr. Mahathir tried to enhance UMNO's legitimacy among Malays while further sidelining Pas with so-called Islamization policies -- starting halal food certification, promoting Islamic courts and offering Islamic banking. He also sent political opponents to jail, shut down newspapers that challenged him and concentrated power in the prime minister's office, weakening the cabinet, Parliament and the courts.\par \par \uc2 The combination of communalism and authoritarianism that both Mr. Razak and Mr. Mahathir embedded into the system over the years helps explain Mr. Najib's resilience today.\par \par \uc2 In fact, Mr. Najib only survived the last general election in 2013 thanks to years of gerrymandering and the skewed allocation of seats in the national legislature. That year the opposition coalition Pakatan Rakyat secured only 40 percent of seats in Parliament despite winning 51 percent of the popular vote.\par \par \uc2 Dissenting voices have been increasingly harassed. In addition to the opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, who is in jail on what many people believe are trumped-up sodomy charges, at least 18 opposition lawmakers have been investigated for or charged with sedition and other offenses since 2013.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the affirmative action programs have stalled. Although they greatly reduced absolute poverty among Malays, they have done too little to raise their competitiveness. For example, Malays are overrepresented among unemployed youth with \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2  degrees. Yet UMNO has deftly managed to exploit the policy's waning effectiveness and even the prospect of its demise.\par \par \uc2 Malaysia's first-past-the-post election system and the great concentration of power in the prime minister's office mean that a change of the guard could happen suddenly and have sweeping effects. Playing on Muslim Malays' growing fear that their dominance would be threatened if UMNO lost power and the bumiputera preferences were terminated, the party has doubled down on communal politics over the past decade.\par \par \uc2 Since the strong showing of opposition parties in the 2008 general election, ethno-religious controversies -- over how women should dress, over who can say ''Allah'', drink alcohol or touch dogs -- have multiplied and intensified. UMNO routinely accuses opposition parties of serving Chinese or Christian interests to the detriment of Malays. When Mr. Mahathir left UMNO last year, a party leader accused him of being a ''puppet'' of the secularist and predominantly ethnic-Chinese Democratic Action Party (DAP).\par \par \uc2 The once-formidable opposition coalition Pakatan Rakyat -- consisting of Mr. Anwar's centrist party, Pas and DAP -- fell apart in 2015, largely because of disagreement over Pas's proposal to harden Shariah punishments in some states. UMNO is now backing a bill Pas submitted to Parliament that would pave the way for such penalties. This rapprochement is a shrewd political move -- a signal by UMNO that it is trying to preserve Malay-Muslim unity by strengthening the place of Islam in Malaysian politics.\par \par \uc2 What glues many Malays to UMNO isn't just personal patronage, as Mr. Mahathir claims, but also, and much more so, communal patronage, reinforced by the system's authoritarian features. UMNO's affirmative action policies may have reached a dead-end, but even if the opposition hopes to transcend Malaysia's ethnic politics, it simply cannot do so right now. It has few options ahead of the next general election, which is expected to take place by August 2018.\par \par \uc2 To win over communalist Malay voters, some people in the opposition want to woo Pas back. But that would mean agreeing to Pas's Shariah project, which is what ripped the opposition apart in 2015 and remains anathema to many non-Muslims (and some Muslims, too).\par \par \uc2 Others, like Mr. Mahathir and his supporters, seem to be on a personal crusade against Mr. Najib and tend to downplay the system's structural flaws. Not admitting his part in creating those problems may be a way for Mr. Mahathir to reassure Malay communalists -- he isn't kowtowing to the Chinese; the bumiputera preferences will remain -- but it is already alienating some minorities and reformists. In any event, only bold institutional reforms could correct the system's authoritarian and sectarian features.\par \par \uc2 Malaysia needs a wholesale political transformation, but it isn't ready for one. Six decades after independence, true multiparty democracy is still a long way away.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Chin-Huat Wong is a political scientist with the Penang Institute, a state government think tank.\par \par \uc2 Above, a protester's scarf bearing the logo of Bersih, an electoral-reform movement, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in November.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The videotaped sucker punch that staggered the white nationalist Richard Spencer on Inauguration Day quickly inspired mockery on social media. But it echoed loudly in an escalating confrontation between extreme ends of the political spectrum.\par \par \uc2 With far-right groups edging into the mainstream with the rise of President Trump, self-described anti-fascists and anarchists are vowing to confront them at every turn, and by any means necessary -- including violence.\par \par \uc2 In Berkeley, Calif., on Wednesday night, masked protesters set fires, smashed windows and stormed buildings on the campus of the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of California to shut down a speech by Milo Yiannopoulos, an inflammatory Breitbart News editor and a right-wing provocateur already barred from \uc2 Twitter\uc2 . Five people were injured, administrators canceled the event, and the \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2  police locked down the campus for hours [Page A9].\par \par \uc2 That followed a bloody melee in Seattle on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, when black-clad demonstrators -- their faces concealed to minimize the risk of arrest -- tried to prevent a speech by Mr. Yiannopoulos at the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Washington\uc2 , and a 34-year-old anti-fascist was shot and seriously wounded by a supporter of Mr. Yiannopoulos.\par \par \uc2 The outbreaks of destruction and violence since Mr. Trump's inauguration have earned contempt from Republicans -- including Trump supporters who say it is exactly why they voted for his promises of law and order -- and condemnation from Democrats like Berkeley's mayor, Jesse Arregu\u237\'00\'EDn. He called Wednesday's display ''contrary to progressive values'' and said it ''provided the ultranationalist far right exactly the images they want'' to try to discredit peaceful protesters of Mr. Trump's policies.\par \par \uc2 But anarchists and anti-fascists, who often make up a small but disproportionately attention-getting portion of protesters, defend the mayhem they create as a necessary response to an emergency.\par \par \uc2 ''Yes, what the black bloc did last night was destructive to property,'' Eric Laursen, a writer in Massachusetts who has helped publicize anarchist protests, said, using another name for the black-clad demonstrators. ''But do you just let someone like Milo go wherever he wants and spread his hate? That kind of argument can devolve into 'just sit on your hands and wait for it to pass.' And it doesn't.''\par \par \uc2 Anarchists also say their recent efforts have been wildly successful, both by focusing attention on their most urgent argument -- that Mr. Trump poses a fascist threat -- and by enticing others to join their movement.\par \par \uc2 ''The number of people who have been showing up to meetings, the number of meetings, and the number of already-evolving plans for future actions is through the roof,'' Legba Carrefour, who helped organize the so-called Disrupt J20 protests on Inauguration Day in Washington, said in an interview.\par \par \uc2 ''Gained 1,000 followers in the last week,'' trumpeted @NYCAntifa, an anti-fascist \uc2 Twitter\uc2  account in New York, on Jan. 24. ''Pretty crazy for us as we've been active for many years with minimal attention. SMASH FASCISM!''\par \par \uc2 The movement even claims to be finding adherents far afield of major population centers. A participant in CrimeThinc, a decades-old anarchist network, pointed to rising attendance at its meetings and activity cropping up in new places like Omaha.\par \par \uc2 ''The Left ignores us. The Right demonizes us,'' the anarchist website It's Going Down boasted on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 . ''Everyday we grow stronger.''\par \par \uc2 Little known to practitioners of mainstream American politics, militant anti-fascists make up a secretive culture closely associated with anarchists. Both reject social hierarchies as undemocratic and eschew the political parties as hopelessly corrupt, according to interviews with a dozen anarchists around the country. While some anarchists espouse nonviolence, others view property damage and even physical attacks on the far right as important tactics.\par \par \uc2 While extreme right-wing groups have been enthusiastic supporters of Mr. Trump, anti-fascists express deep disdain for the Democratic Party. And it is mutual, by and large: They amount to the left's unwanted revolutionary stepchild, disowned for their tactics and ideology by all but the most radical politicians.\par \par \uc2 Anarchists came to the fore in 1999, when they mounted a huge demonstration in Seattle against the \uc2 World Trade Organization\uc2 , which they denounce -- along with Nafta and other free-trade pacts -- as a plutocratic back-room group that exploits the poor. Enthusiasm for the movement dipped after the election of President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 . But it revived as they played a role in some of the most consequential protests during his two terms, starting Occupy Wall Street and serving as foot soldiers in demonstrations against the Dakota Access Pipeline at Standing Rock in North Dakota and in Black Lives Matter protests in Ferguson, Mo., and elsewhere.\par \par \uc2 ''We've had an enormous cultural and political impact,'' said David Graeber, a professor at the London School of Economics who helped organize the Occupy protests and has been credited with coining its ''we are the 99 percent'' slogan. He said the movement had elevated income inequality to the top of the Democratic political agenda, despite not electing anyone or enacting any legislation.\par \par \uc2 But he said Mr. Trump's victory had proved that anarchists' diagnosis of society's ills was correct.\par \par \uc2 ''We tried to warn you, with Occupy,'' Dr. Graeber said. ''We understood that people were sick of the political system, which is fundamentally corrupt. People want something radically different.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump's tirades against trade deals, globalization and a Washington elite he views as corrupt mirror arguments that anarchists have been making for decades. But his claim that he alone can fix America's problems flies in the face of anarchists' conviction that only direct action by ordinary people can produce a fair system.\par \par \uc2 ''Fascism fetishizes having a strong leader who is decisive and tells everyone what to do,'' Mr. Laursen, the writer, said. ''That's what we are seeing with Trump.''\par \par \uc2 Fueled in part by Mr. Trump's political success, violent clashes between the far right and far left erupted several times during the presidential campaign. In Anaheim, Calif., last February, three people were stabbed in a brawl after anti-fascists disrupted a Ku Klux Klan rally. And in Sacramento in June, at least five people were stabbed and eight wounded when hundreds of counterprotesters, including anti-fascists, clashed with skinheads at a rally.\par \par \uc2 But the confrontations seemed to shift into a new gear on the eve of Mr. Trump's inauguration. On Jan. 19, anti-fascists tried to block the entrance to the ''DeploraBall,'' a party for Trump supporters. The next day, 230 people were arrested after anarchists dressed in black broke the windows of a bank with baseball bats and set a limousine on fire. (Mr. Spencer, the white nationalist, whose assailant was not arrested, was not the only person struck: A videographer was struck in the chest with a flagpole -- he was unharmed -- as he tried to interview marching anarchists about what the word ''community'' meant to them.)\par \par \uc2 One of those arrested, a self-described anarchist who insisted on anonymity to avoid aiding in his own prosecution, said the goal of the protests -- to get television stations to cut away from the inauguration, even for a moment -- had been met.\par \par \uc2 ''Certainly, it has brought more attention to people who were against Trump and what he stands for,'' the man said by telephone.\par \par \uc2 The question now is whether anarchists' efforts against Mr. Trump -- whether merely colorful and spirited, or lawless and potentially lethal -- will earn their fringe movement a bigger presence in the battle of ideas in years to come.\par \par \uc2 ''It's true that a lot of people who consider themselves liberals or progressives still cling to the idea that you can effect social and economic change in the context of the state, through electoral politics,'' Mr. Laursen said. ''But more and more, it is going to become necessary for people on the left to think like anarchists if they are going to get anywhere.''\par \par \uc2 If the Berkeley disturbances have invited widespread denunciations, the on-camera punch of Mr. Spencer inflamed emotions on both the left and the right wing. Mr. Spencer has offered a reward for anyone who can identify his attacker, who wore the telltale clothing and face-covering of the anarchist ''black bloc.'' But anarchists in Philadelphia have already begun raising funds for the man's legal defense should he ever be caught.\par \par \uc2 Under the hashtag #PunchRichardSpencerAgain, anti-fascists and anarchists across the country are vowing to continue the fight. ''May all your punches hit Nazis,'' read a headline on It's Going Down on Sunday.\par \par \uc2 A few days earlier, the website gleefully announced on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  that Mr. Spencer was planning a tour of college campuses, adding, ''Everyone will get their chance!''\par \par \uc2 Protests in Berkeley, Calif., on Wednesday led to the cancellation of a speech by the right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 LONDON -- Pedro Pascal was a little lost.\par \par \uc2 He exited the Liverpool Street train station, staring at the glowing blue Google Maps dot on his iPhone screen. And that is when he nearly had an ending much like that of Oberyn Martell, the character he played on ''Game of Thrones.''\par \par \uc2 While crossing the street, he looked left when he should have looked right (classic error of the tourist in London), and a double-decker bus came thisclose.\par \par \uc2 He barely had a moment to compose himself when he was spotted.\par \par \uc2 ''Pascal Pedro!'' said a young man, getting his name almost right. ''Can we get a photo? We love your character in 'Game of Thrones.'''\par \par \uc2 A little later, someone driving a white van in the narrow streets of Shoreditch hit the brakes. ''Agent Pe\u241\'00\'F1a!'' he said, referring to Mr. Pascal's character in the \uc2 Netflix\uc2  series ''Narcos.'' ''Excellent, mate.''\par \par \uc2 At 41, Mr. Pascal is far from a household name, but fame is rushing at him. As he described it, he has gone from decades of anonymity to becoming the ''aren't you the guy from ... ?'' guy.\par \par \uc2 Soon enough, fans may even get his name right. In addition to his role on ''Narcos,'' Mr. Pascal appears in ''The Great Wall,'' a big-budget fantasy filmed mostly in Beijing that will be released in the United States on Feb. 17, after its splashy China debut. He will also have a lead role in the ''Kingsman'' sequel, set for release later this year.\par \par \uc2 Late Success\par \par \uc2 After years of making ends meet with TV work and a prolific theater career, Mr. Pascal is not about to waste his chance. ''The smallest of opportunities kept me going,'' he said. ''So much so that I resolved to struggle until I couldn't walk anymore.''\par \par \uc2 As the actress Sarah Paulson, one of his closest friends, put it: ''Most people don't get to be in their early 40s and have their lives change, workwise, in this business.''\par \par \uc2 The change in his success means that Mr. Pascal has seen little of his apartment in West Hollywood, Calif., the past few years. He was in Europe for ''Game of Thrones,'' Colombia for ''Narcos,'' China for ''The Great Wall'' and London for ''Kingsman.''\par \par \uc2 And that's what brought him to a shop here on an afternoon before Christmas. He would be flying to Chile the next day to visit his family, and now, with the big paychecks coming in, he could spend a couple of hundred pounds to get Aesop soaps for his brother and adorable pajamas for his sister.\par \par \uc2 ''I like to spoil her,'' he said, noting that he could never do it before.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pascal was born in Santiago, Chile, and raised in San Antonio and Orange County, Calif. He grew up dreaming of movies, which did little to help his social life. ''I was the one who wouldn't shut up about 'Empire of the Sun,''' he said.\par \par \uc2 His parents fled Chile in the 1970s during the military junta and worked out a life of comfort in the United States. His father was a fertility doctor, and his mother, a former child psychologist, handed him the keys to her Volvo when he turned 16.\par \par \uc2 His cozy adolescence was upended after he decamped to \uc2 New York \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2 , when his father, Dr. Jose Balmaceda, was ensnarled in a headline-making scandal involving the Orange County fertility clinic he ran with two other men. Mr. Pascal's father, mother and two youngest brothers went to Chile. (Many people said Dr. Balmaceda fled the country; Mr. Pascal contends his father did nothing wrong.) Soon afterward, his mother died.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pascal and his sister did not join the rest of the family, sharing a shoe box apartment on Elizabeth Street in Manhattan as he pursued acting work. Theater assignments piled up, as did a few TV roles, including one-offs on ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and ''Touched by an Angel.'' Money was tight. At the \uc2 Manhattan Theater Club\uc2 , Mr. Pascal brought in about $515 a week.\par \par \uc2 ''The TV stuff means you're getting, in about three to eight days of work, more money than an entire run Off Broadway,'' he said. ''And that's not even a lot of money. You want 'Law & Order' so badly that you just want to die.''\par \par \uc2 Asked if he was ever typecast as a Latino, he said, ''I was desperate to be typecast so I could get a job.'' On the stages of New York, he said, he played a series of masculine gay men and vaguely ethnic characters. But breakout roles, both onstage and on television, proved elusive, and there were plenty of times when he was ready to quit.\par \par \uc2 ''He has a rather righteous sense of self,'' Ms. Paulson said. ''When I look back at it now, I do know there was always this voice deep down inside him that said someday he was going to do what he wanted to do in the manner in which he wanted to do it.\par \par \uc2 ''But the more you're told no, that little voice starts to get quieter and quieter, and it gets further and further away.''\par \par \uc2 Grabbing His Chance\par \par \uc2 Things changed about four years ago, thanks to a bit of hustling.\par \par \uc2 While Mr. Pascal was mentoring a student at the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Southern California\uc2 , his prot\u233\'00\'E9g\u233\'00\'E9 was preparing to audition for a role as a late-30-something bisexual Lothario in ''Game of Thrones.'' The student, in his 20s, was too young for the part, and when Mr. Pascal read the script, he was blown away. The role seemed made for him.\par \par \uc2 He put together an audition tape, which he failed to mention to his younger friend. (For the record, the student, Francisco Garat, said in an interview that he was thrilled for Mr. Pascal's success.)\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pascal asked Ms. Paulson if she could possibly, maybe pass along the tape to her best friend, Amanda Peet, who is married to the ''Thrones'' co-creator David Benioff. Mr. Benioff, Ms. Peet and the show's other mastermind, D. B. Weiss, watched Mr. Pascal and the reviews were ecstatic. Ms. Paulson called to tell him.\par \par \uc2 In 2014, Mr. Pascal became a fan favorite on the show as the swaggering Red Viper, a role that ended after one season, when his head was crushed by a character called the Mountain. But Mr. Pascal wasn't out of work for long. He was quickly cast in ''Narcos,'' a drama about the Colombian drug trade.\par \par \uc2 When the director Matthew Vaughn was watching ''Narcos,'' he kept thinking, ''Who's this Burt Reynolds guy?'' He asked him to audition for ''Kingsman,'' an action movie he was about to direct. The actor Mr. Vaughn saw before him was shaped by years of obscurity and missed chances.\par \par \uc2 ''He had this swagger and confidence,'' Mr. Vaughn said, ''but at the same time such vulnerability of expecting to be rejected.''\par \par \uc2 Soon Mr. Pascal was fighting computer-generated mythical beasts alongside Matt Damon in ''The Great Wall,'' a Zhang Yimou epic that the Chinese film industry has positioned as a global blockbuster.\par \par \uc2 Early box office returns have fallen short of expectations, but no matter. When Mr. Pascal started to reflect on his sudden star turn, he recalled a moment during his 40th birthday, when he was filming in Beijing.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Damon and a producer asked to have a word with him. For an actor long accustomed to coming up short, it was an unnerving request. As they led him off the set, the cast and crew surrounded him. Next thing he knew, a giant birthday cake was being rolled out and fireworks lit up the sky.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm turning 40 and I'm in Beijing,'' Mr. Pascal said. ''I am absolutely fine with experiencing my birthday anonymously and with a day at work. And, instead, I got a big freaking cake and fireworks. I was like, 'What the hell is happening?'''\par \par \uc2 Continue following our fashion and lifestyle coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  (Styles and Modern Love), \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (Styles, Fashion and Weddings) and \uc2 Instagram\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Pedro Pascal in London. ''He had this swagger and confidence but at the same time such vulnerability of expecting to be rejected,'' said the director Matthew Vaughn, who asked Mr. Pascal to audition for ''Kingsman'' after watching him in ''Narcos.''

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Chumley's is one of those New York City landmarks with so much history it's hard to know where to begin in telling it. The West Village bar was a Depression-era speakeasy; a rough-and-tumble watering hole for generations of writers, including Ernest Hemingway, Jack Kerouac and Norman Mailer; a divey hangout for N.Y.U. kids; and a bar tended and patronized by the firefighters of Ladder 5.\par \par \uc2 It closed in 2007 after a wall collapsed, and the long effort to reopen the place became an adventure in its own right. It was finally resurrected in October by Alessandro Borgognone, an owner of Sushi Nakazawa, and \uc2 Jim Miller\uc2 , a firefighter. The black-and-white portraits of writers are still on the walls, but the beer-and-a-shot menu and the food have been elevated to appeal to a more upscale clientele.\par \par \uc2 Jessie Dur\u233\'00\'E9, the 31-year-old bar manager, reflects the change in style. She is a reserved woman who reads scientific journals and books about wine and spirits.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, she studied neuroscience at \uc2 McGill \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  and originally planned to be a doctor, and attended Columbia Medical School. Between college and medical school, she worked at another longstanding N.Y.U. hangout in the Village, Dojo West, and the experience helped turn her into a bartender.\par \par \uc2 The comfort and familiarity she felt behind the bar puzzled her at first. Eventually, she recognized the parallels between bartending and her family background.\par \par \uc2 For 30 years, Ms. Dur\u233\'00\'E9's parents, both immigrants from South America, ran the Fieldston Deli in the Bronx. She worked alongside them as soon as she was ''old enough to converse and count money,'' Ms. Dur\u233\'00\'E9 said with a laugh.\par \par \uc2 ''I started to realize this all makes sense,'' she said. ''I'm comfortable in this environment. Hospitality, being behind a service station, just fits with me.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Dur\u233\'00\'E9 continued to bartend while in medical school, managing all three Bar and Books properties. After two years, she had to make a choice -- was her workplace going to be a hospital or a bar? Her parents' hope of having a doctor in the family made the decision difficult.\par \par \uc2 She took a job at American Whiskey in Midtown, assembling and managing a team that was still with her three years later, she noted. Feeling the need to grow, last year she moved on to Sushi Nakazawa.\par \par \uc2 When the chance came to create the bar program at Chumley's, Ms. Dur\u233\'00\'E9 said yes. Following Mr. Borgognone's directive, she has tried to fuse its history as a writer's dive with its more stylish current incarnation.\par \par \uc2 For instance, the Mr. Easy cocktail she created uses fancy ingredients like Botanist gin; Yuzushu, a Japanese liqueur; and Suze, a French aperitif.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 BERKELEY, Calif. -- Fires burned in the cradle of free speech. Furious at a lecture organized on campus, demonstrators wearing ninja-like outfits smashed windows, threw rocks at the police and stormed a building. The speech? The \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2  called it off.\par \par \uc2 Protest has been synonymous with the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of California, Berkeley\uc2 , from the earliest days of the free speech movement, when students fought to expand political expression on campus beginning in 1964. Those protests would set off student activism movements that roiled campuses across the country throughout the 1960s. Since then, countless demonstrators have flocked to Sproul Plaza each day to have their voices heard on issues from civil rights and apartheid to Israel, tuition costs and more.\par \par \uc2 But now the \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2  is under siege for canceling a speech by the incendiary right-wing writer Milo Yiannopoulos and words like intolerance, long used by the left, are being used by critics to condemn the protests on Wednesday night that ultimately prevented Mr. Yiannopoulos from speaking.\par \par \uc2 Naweed Tahmas, a junior who is a member of the Berkeley College Republicans, the group that invited Mr. Yiannopoulos to campus, said the cancellation had made him more determined to fight for freedom of speech on campus.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm tired of getting silenced, as many conservative students are,'' he said. ''If we support freedom of speech, we should support all speech including what they consider hate speech.''\par \par \uc2 When the event was canceled, the Republican student group reacted by writing on their \uc2 Facebook\uc2  page, ''the Free Speech Movement is dead.''\par \par \uc2 More than 100 faculty members signed a letter opposing the visit by Mr. Yiannopoulos in recent weeks. ''We support robust debate, but we cannot abide by harassment, slander, defamation, and hate speech,'' they wrote.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, heated arguments broke out at Sproul Plaza between students who said Mr. Yiannopoulos -- a provocateur editor at Breitbart News who is known for his attacks on political correctness and offensive, racially-charged writing -- was too inflammatory to be invited to campus and those who argued that he should have been allowed to speak.\par \par \uc2 The \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2  made it clear they believed the people who resorted to violence on Wednesday night -- a group, clad in black clothing and carrying sticks -- had come from outside the campus. The \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2  estimated on Thursday that the rioting had caused around $100,000 in damage.\par \par \uc2 Whatever the origins of the violent mob, the \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2  was and remains divided over the meaning of free speech at a time of national political tumult.\par \par \uc2 ''I think we need to have a serious conversation about protests. This is going to be a big part of our lives for the next four years,'' said Kirsten Pickering, a graduate student at the \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2 . She and others described the violence as a ''potential teachable moment.''\par \par \uc2 ''We need to sit down and talk about what is acceptable,'' she added.\par \par \uc2 Troy Worden, a third-year student and a member of the College Republicans, said he would ''absolutely'' invite Mr. Yiannopoulos to speak on campus again, and Mr. Tahmas added that the Republican student group is a racially diverse group that does not consider Mr. Yiannopoulos to be a white nationalist.\par \par \uc2 Criticism of the decision to cancel the speech came from outside the \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2  as well. On \uc2 Twitter\uc2  early on Thursday, President Trump went as far as to threaten withholding federal funds from the \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2  for failing to stop ''violence on people with a different point of view.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Yiannopoulos has cultivated a sizable following among the so-called alt-right movement with his speaking events, podcast interviews and articles. He travels around California on a tour bus airbrushed with his likeness.\par \par \uc2 Since embarking in September on his speaking tour of American campuses, he has been trailed by protests. But the events have also attracted pockets of self-described anarchists clad in face masks and spoiling for a fight. Some \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2  organizers withdrew invitations to Mr. Yiannopoulos over security concerns. At the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of California, Davis\uc2 , on Jan. 13, his speech was canceled as it was set to begin after a tense standoff between protesters and police officers. A week later, on Inauguration Day, a man was shot during protests outside Mr. Yiannopoulos's speech at the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Washington\uc2  in Seattle.\par \par \uc2 He was to cap his tour this week at Berkeley. In the weeks leading up to the event, campus administrators faced tremendous pressure from student groups and faculty members to cancel it.\par \par \uc2 In a video of himself posted on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  after the cancellation on Wednesday night, Mr. Yiannopoulos criticized the ''hard left, which has become so utterly antithetical to free speech in the last few years.''\par \par \uc2 ''They simply will not allow any speaker on campus, even somebody as silly and harmless and gay as me to have their voice heard,'' he added.\par \par \uc2 One group that has been outspoken in favor of allowing Mr. Yiannopoulos to speak is the veterans of the \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2 's free speech movement.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm really a little fatigued with all of this, 'Oh my goodness, cover my ears, someone will say something that will upset me, I can't tolerate that,' '' said Jack Radey, who was a 17-year-old activist during the original free speech movement at Berkeley.\par \par \uc2 ''There are racists, sexists, piggery of various kinds who will say really terrible things. And that is part of the world,'' Mr. Radey said by telephone from Oregon, where he is retired. ''Learn how to fight back. Don't say, 'Oh, no. We can't allow someone to speak because someone might be offended.' ''\par \par \uc2 In a letter to The Daily Californian, Berkeley's student newspaper, Mr. Radey and other members of the Free Speech Movement Archive board of directors, a grouping of some of the movement's activists, said Mr. Yiannopoulos was ''a bigot who comes to campus spouting vitriol so as to attract attention to himself.''\par \par \uc2 But they said free speech was paramount.\par \par \uc2 ''Berkeley's free speech tradition, won through struggle -- suspension, arrest, fines, jail time -- by Free Speech Movement activists is far more important than Yiannopoulos, and it is that tradition's endurance that concerns us,'' they wrote.\par \par \uc2 Cleaning up at the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of California, Berkeley, on Thursday, a day after a demonstration against the right-wing writer Milo Yiannopoulos ended in violence. (A9); Officials estimated that Wednesday's protest had caused about $100,000 in damage, including a fire and smashed windows.

The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 BERKELEY, Calif. \u8212\'20\'14 What do you do as a reporter when a protest begins? You cover it.\par \par \uc2 But what about when the man being protested is known for rhetoric that makes you nauseated? Or when you see a student get beaten up because he looked \u8220\'20\'1Clike a Nazi\u8221\'20\'1D?\par \par \uc2 How do you remain objective?\par \par \uc2 Those were the questions that faced me when, as a reporter for the student newspaper at the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of California, Berkeley, I covered {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/01/us/milo-yiannopoulos-berkeley/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 the protest on Wednesday }}}{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/01/us/milo-yiannopoulos-berkeley/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2  night }}}\uc2 at the college that turned violent, drawing national attention. I didn\u8217\'20\'19t know what to think about it all, and truthfully, I still don\u8217\'20\'19t.\par \par \uc2 The protesters were demonstrating against a scheduled speech on campus by Milo Yiannopoulos, a Breitbart editor and right-wing provocateur, who had been invited by the Berkeley College Republicans.\par \par \uc2 This was always going to be a controversial event. Mr. Yiannopoulos has been giving inflammatory speeches on a college tour meant to push back against what he sees as the stifling politically correct left. But his language has veered decidedly toward hate speech. At the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, for example, he singled out a transgender student for ridicule by name.\par \par \uc2 Because of actions like that, many Berkeley students and more than 100 faculty members petitioned the \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2  to block the event, but the chancellor, Nicholas Dirks, declined to do so, citing free speech.\par \par \uc2 This, of course, raises questions about free speech: Is it free speech if it makes us feel unsafe in our own skin? On the other hand, what does this campus represent if it doesn\u8217\'20\'19t respect the rights of people with whom many of us disagree?\par \par \uc2 Protests are a staple at Berkeley and I\u8217\'20\'19ve always appreciated the activism here. Wednesday night, I saw many creative posters urging people to fight Islamophobia, xenophobia, homophobia, transphobia, sexism and racism. One group of protesters wore red ribbons emblazoned \u8220\'20\'1CResist,\u8221\'20\'1D while another led a \u8220\'20\'1Cresistance dance party\u8221\'20\'1D near the venue.\par \par \uc2 Until Wednesday, I never felt in danger during a protest. Around 7 p.m. I saw a huddle of people yelling at one another. As more people surrounded them, a burning red trucker\u8217\'20\'19s hat was held up on a stick. There were reports that another student wearing what appeared to be a \u8220\'20\'1CMake America Great Again\u8221\'20\'1D hat was severely injured.\par \par \uc2 Then I saw someone wearing all black walk up to a student wearing a suit and say, \u8220\'20\'1CYou look like a Nazi.\u8221\'20\'1D The student was confused, but before he could reply, the black-clad person pepper-sprayed him and hit him on the back with a rod.\par \par \uc2 I ran after the student who was attacked to get his name and more information. He told me that he is a Syrian Muslim. Before I could find out more, he fled, fearing another attack. Amid the chaos came word the event had been canceled.\par \par \uc2 It was clear early on that the majority of violent protesters most likely were not from the campus. Still, in the aftermath, I heard people say that peaceful demonstrations would not have succeeded in preventing Mr. Yiannopoulos from speaking. So was violence appropriate?\par \par \uc2 A Trump supporter was hurt. A Syrian Muslim student was hurt. Does either of those statements seem more outrageous than the other?\par \par \uc2 Violence often has unintended consequences. For one thing, those who initiated the violence implicated many others in it too. Black students, Latino students, gay students and others who are already vulnerable \u8212\'20\'14 and were protesting peacefully \u8212\'20\'14 became even more vulnerable to the backlash.\par \par \uc2 When the violent protesters thought they were defeating \u8220\'20\'1Cfascists,\u8221\'20\'1D could they imagine who else they might be hurting? When my co-reporter was threatened as she recorded students marching down the street, and I was threatened when I took pictures of the vandalism, I myself became afraid and upset.\par \par \uc2 There are so many people in this country who have been fighting social injustices for years. Acts of violence undermine their efforts, and can reverse good, patient work. The beauty and the defining characteristic of peaceful protests is that they are a struggle, and they don\u8217\'20\'19t always translate to concrete results. How do protesters achieve success when they are screaming at the top of their lungs and it doesn\u8217\'20\'19t seem as if anyone can hear? I understand that frustration. I have felt that frustration.\par \par \uc2 However, just because peaceful protest doesn\u8217\'20\'19t get as much attention as punching someone in the face, it doesn\u8217\'20\'19t mean that we should abandon the commitment to peace. Violence doesn\u8217\'20\'19t encourage social progress, and it certainly doesn\u8217\'20\'19t quiet those with whom we disagree.\par \par \uc2 I understand the fight for a more progressive, just society. But this is not how we get there.\par \par \uc2 Malini Ramaiyer is a first-year student at the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of California, Berkeley\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 A protester who was injured during the demonstration at the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of California Berkeley, on Wednesday. | Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images \par \par \uc2 Document NYTFEED020170203ed2300105\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw126\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1890\pichgoal600

To Forget, Scientists Say\b0\par\par\uc2 By CARL ZIMMER \par \uc2 1,158 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 February 2017\par \uc2 International New York Times\par \uc2 INHT\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2017 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Over the years, scientists have come up with a lot of ideas about why we sleep.\par \par \uc2 Some have argued that it\u8217\'20\'19s a way to save energy. Others have suggested that slumber provides an opportunity to clear away the brain\u8217\'20\'19s cellular waste. Still others have proposed that sleep simply forces animals to lie still, letting them hide from predators.\par \par \uc2 A pair of papers published on Thursday in the journal Science offer evidence for another notion: We sleep to forget some of the things we learn each day.\par \par \uc2 In order to learn, we have to grow connections, or synapses, between the neurons in our brains. These connections enable neurons to send signals to one another quickly and efficiently. We store new memories in these networks.\par \par \uc2 In 2003, Giulio Tononi and Chiara Cirelli, biologists at the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Wisconsin-Madison\uc2 , grew so exuberantly during the day that our brain circuits got \u8220\'20\'1Cnoisy.\u8221\'20\'1D When we sleep, the scientists argued, our brains pare back the connections to lift the signal over the noise.\par \par \uc2 In the years since, Dr. Tononi and Dr. Cirelli, along with other researchers, have found a great deal of indirect evidence to support the so-called synaptic homeostasis hypothesis.\par \par \uc2 It turns out, for example, that neurons can prune their synapses \u8212\'20\'14 at least in a dish. In laboratory experiments on clumps of neurons, scientists can give them a drug that spurs them to grow extra synapses. Afterward, the neurons pare back some of the growth.\par \par \uc2 Other evidence comes from the electric waves released by the brain. During deep sleep, the waves slow down. Dr. Tononi and Dr. Cirelli have argued that shrinking synapses produce this change.\par \par \uc2 Four years ago, Dr. Tononi and Dr. Cirelli got a chance to test their theory by looking at the synapses themselves. They acquired a kind of deli slicer for brain tissue, which they used to shave ultrathin sheets from a mouse\u8217\'20\'19s brain.\par \par \uc2 Luisa de Vivo, an assistant scientist working in their lab, led a painstaking survey of tissue taken from mice, some awake and others asleep. She and her colleagues determined the size and shape of 6,920 synapses in total.\par \par \uc2 The synapses in the brains of sleeping mice, they found, were 18 percent smaller than in awake ones. \u8220\'20\'1CThat there\u8217\'20\'19s such a big change over all is surprising,\u8221\'20\'1D Dr. Tononi said.\par \par \uc2 was led by Graham H. Diering, a postdoctoral researcher at Johns Hopkins \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Dr. Diering and his colleagues set out to explore the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis by studying the proteins in mouse brains. \u8220\'20\'1CI\u8217\'20\'19m really coming at it from this nuts-and-bolts place,\u8221\'20\'1D Dr. Diering said.\par \par \uc2 In one experiment, Dr. Diering and his colleagues created a tiny window through which they could peer into mouse brains. Then he and his colleagues added a chemical that lit up a surface protein on brain synapses.\par \par \uc2 Looking through the window, they found that the number of surface proteins dropped during sleep. That decline is what you would expect if the synapses were shrinking.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Diering and his colleagues then searched for the molecular trigger for this change. They found that hundreds of proteins increase or decrease inside of synapses during the night. But one protein in particular, called Homer1A, stood out.\par \par \uc2 In earlier experiments on neurons in a dish, Homer1A proved to be important for paring back synapses. Dr. Diering wondered if it was important in sleep, too.\par \par \uc2 To find out, he and his colleagues studied mice genetically engineered so that they couldn\u8217\'20\'19t make Homer1A proteins. These mice slept like ordinary mice, but their synapses didn\u8217\'20\'19t change their proteins like the ones in ordinary mice.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Diering\u8217\'20\'19s research suggests that sleepiness triggers neurons to make Homer1A and ship it into their synapses. When sleep arrives, Homer1A turns on the pruning machinery.\par \par \uc2 To see how this pruning machinery affects learning, the scientists gave regular mice a memory test. They put the animals in a room where they got a mild electric shock if they walked over one section of the floor.\par \par \uc2 That night, the scientists injected a chemical into the brains of some of the mice. The chemical had been shown to block neurons in dishes from pruning their synapses.\par \par \uc2 The next day, the scientists put all the mice back in the chamber they had been in before. Both groups of mice spent much of the time frozen, fearfully recalling the shock.\par \par \uc2 But when the researchers put the mice in a different chamber, they saw a big difference. The ordinary mice sniffed around curiously. The mice that had been prevented from pruning their brain synapses during sleep, on the other hand, froze once again.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Diering thinks that the injected mice couldn\u8217\'20\'19t narrow their memories down to the particular chamber where they had gotten the shock. Without nighttime pruning, their memories ended up fuzzy.\par \par \uc2 In their own experiment, Dr. Tononi and his colleagues found that the pruning didn\u8217\'20\'19t strike every neuron. A fifth of the synapses were unchanged. It\u8217\'20\'19s possible that these synapses encode well-established memories that shouldn\u8217\'20\'19t be tampered with.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CYou can forget in a smart way,\u8221\'20\'1D Dr. Tononi said.\par \par \uc2 Other researchers cautioned that the new findings weren\u8217\'20\'19t definitive proof of the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis.\par \par \uc2 Marcos G. Frank, a sleep researcher at Washington State \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  in Spokane, said that it could be hard to tell whether changes to the brain at night were caused by sleep or by the biological clock. \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s a general problem in the field,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 Markus H. Schmidt, of the Ohio Sleep Medicine Institute, said that while the brain might prune synapses during sleep, he questioned whether this was the main explanation for why sleep exists.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe work is great,\u8221\'20\'1D he said of the new studies, \u8220\'20\'1Cbut the question is, is this a function of sleep or is it the function?\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Many organs, not just the brain, seem to function differently during sleep, Dr. Schmidt pointed out. The gut appears to make many new cells, for example.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Tononi said that the new findings should prompt a look at what current sleeping drugs do in the brain. While they may be good at making people sleepy, it\u8217\'20\'19s also possible that they may interfere with the pruning required for forming memories.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CYou may actually work against yourself,\u8221\'20\'1D Dr. Tononi said.\par \par \uc2 In the future, sleep medicines might precisely target the molecules involved in sleep, ensuring that synapses get properly pruned.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COnce you know a little bit of what happens at the ground-truth level, you can get a better idea of what to do for therapy,\u8221\'20\'1D Dr. Tononi said.\par \par \uc2 | Sign up for the\par \par \uc2 Follow Carl Zimmer on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  @carlzimmer\par \par \uc2 PHOTO (PHOTOGRAPH BY HANK MORGAN/SCIENCE SOURCE)\par \par \uc2 Related Articles\par \par \uc2 https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/03/science/03ZIMMER/03ZIMMER-articleLarge.jpg\uc2  | \uc2 https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/03/science/03ZIMMER/03ZIMMER-jumbo.jpg\uc2  | \uc2 https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/03/science/03ZIMMER/03ZIMMER-superJumbo.jpg\uc2  | \uc2 https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/03/science/03ZIMMER/03ZIMMER-moth.jpg\uc2  | \uc2 https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/03/science/03ZIMMER/03ZIMMER-articleInline.jpg\uc2  | \uc2 https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/03/science/03ZIMMER/03ZIMMER-sfSpan.jpg\uc2  | \uc2 https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/03/science/03ZIMMER/03ZIMMER-filmstrip.jpg\uc2  | A PET scan of a brain during normal sleep.

The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Neal K. Katyal was for a time the top lawyer in the Obama administration. As acting solicitor general, he represented the government before the Supreme Court. He is no conservative, and says he is disappointed that the latest nominee to the court is from the White House of President Donald Trump.\par \par \uc2 Yet in the opinion pages of The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  on Tuesday, Katyal made a forceful case for Trump\u8217\'20\'19s pick to the high court, Judge Neil Gorsuch. Katyal {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/31/opinion/why-liberals-should-back-neil-gorsuch.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 called}}}\uc2  the nominee a man of principle who will uphold the rule of law, and \u8220\'20\'1Cbring a sense of fairness and decency to the job, and a temperament that suits the nation\u8217\'20\'19s highest court.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The author says he knows this because he has seen Gorsuch in action, both in court and through a federal rules committee on which they both serve. What Katyal did not mention \u8212\'20\'14 and the Op-Ed page did not disclose in his bio \u8212\'20\'14 is that he has cases pending before the Supreme Court.\par \par \uc2 Katyal was identified as a former solicitor general, a law professor at Georgetown \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  and a private litigator at the law firm \uc2 Hogan Lovells\uc2 . But in that last role he represents the giant drug manufacturer \uc2 Bristol-Myers Squibb\uc2 , Indian tribes and numerous other clients with cases before the court.\par \par \uc2 Some readers would have liked to know more about Katyal\u8217\'20\'19s background.\par \par \uc2 Here\u8217\'20\'19s one email from Mithra Busler of Atlantic Highlands, N.J.\par \par \uc2 The opinion piece by Neal Katyal, \u8220\'20\'1CWhy Liberals Should Back Neil Gorsuch,\u8221\'20\'1D fails to disclose the many conflicts of interest that plague Mr. Katyal\u8217\'20\'19s credibility as an evenhanded commentator. He is allowed to wave his position as acting solicitor general in the Obama administration as liberal bona fides but fails to mention that his current work involves representing large corporate interests in front of the Supreme Court. At least two of these cases would almost certainly benefit from the confirmation of the pro-corporation Gorsuch.\par \par \uc2 I took this concern to both Op-Ed page and to Katyal himself.\par \par \uc2 Jim Dao, the Op-Ed editor, said the editors had not been aware of Katyal\u8217\'20\'19s cases before the court. Writers are required to disclose potential conflicts, he said, but the process got rushed in this case. \u8220\'20\'1CEditors do try to ask writers directly,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1COn tight deadlines \u8212\'20\'14 and the Katyal piece was done on tight deadline \u8212\'20\'14 the question doesn\u8217\'20\'19t always get asked. So I don\u8217\'20\'19t blame the writer or the editor in this case.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 When I reached out to Katyal, he said he had not received such a disclosure request and had not had a conversation about potential conflicts. He also thought it was obvious to The Times that as a lawyer whose practice often brings him to the Supreme Court, he would have a case before it.\par \par \uc2 More critically, Katyal said, it is common for Supreme Court lawyers not to mention litigation they have pending before the court when writing an opinion piece about a nominee or speaking to a reporter. Here\u8217\'20\'19s his response to me in full:\par \par \uc2 It is a matter of public record that I am a Supreme Court lawyer and naturally will have matters pending before that court. It is quite common for Supreme Court lawyers to express views on nominees without explicitly mentioning their pending cases, as it goes without saying that a Supreme Court practitioner practices before the court. When many Supreme Court lawyers (including former solicitors general) wrote op-eds and publicly praised Judge Garland during his nomination, their pending cases were not mentioned either. The same thing happened with the chief justice\u8217\'20\'19s and Justice Kagan\u8217\'20\'19s confirmations; The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  is in good company. Moreover, it would be completely speculative to presume what a nominee might do as a justice in any particular case. That is especially true in light of my diverse caseload at the Court, which includes a variety of pending matters that might appeal to different judicial ideologies, or that have no clear ideological angle at all. All of that is presumably why your editors did not include such information in my article.\par \par \uc2 The problem is that the piece did not note that Katyal is among the elite lawyers who argue before the high court. That lack of disclosure may leave Katyal open to criticism, not only from readers but from others looking to challenge his motives. (The liberal website ThinkProgress {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://thinkprogress.org/obama-lawyer-supporting-gorsuch-represents-major-corporate-interests-in-supreme-court-93c70ad1d77a#.eld8mm585"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 criticized}}}\uc2  The Times\u8217\'20\'19s failure to disclose his cases on Wednesday.)\par \par \uc2 I\u8217\'20\'19m not suggesting Katyal is currying favor with a man who is almost certainly going to be on the court. I seriously doubt that he is. Plus, given the range of his clients, some might benefit and others not if Gorsuch is even on the bench when their cases come up. But The Times opens itself up to that criticism by failing to simply tell the readers more about who he is.\par \par \uc2 Katyal\u8217\'20\'19s piece falls into an appealing category for an op-ed editor: a partisan who breaks ranks to support the opposition.. Whenever that happens, the author of the piece is bound to endure scrutiny by those who feel betrayed. Shouldn\u8217\'20\'19t The Times err on the side of disclosure? It doesn\u8217\'20\'19t need to be in heavy-handed language that implies a grave conflict.\par \par \uc2 I\u8217\'20\'19m not suggesting that The Times should have listed every case Katyal has before the court. But at minimum, readers in this case deserve to know that he is a Supreme Court litigator with cases before the court. Let the readers decide if that matters, or indeed whether it might even enhance the author\u8217\'20\'19s expertise.\par \par \uc2 Follow the public editor on \uc2 Twitter{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/spaydl"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 @spaydl}}}\uc2  and reach her by email at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:public@nytimes.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 public@nytimes.com}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/30/public-editor/facebook-jessica-lessin-liz-spayd-public-editor.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 How Much Disclosure About an Op-Ed Author Is Required?}}}\par \par \uc2 Standing guard at the Supreme Court building after President Trump introduced Judge Neil Gorsuch as his nominee. | Gabriella Demczuk for The New York Times \par \par \uc2 Document NYTFEED020170202ed2200911\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Not long ago, many Republican officeholders had a simple answer when asked about the changing climate: What changing climate?\par \par \uc2 But the public began to notice the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/28/science/new-study-links-weather-extremes-to-global-warming.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 heat waves}}}\uc2  and the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/13/science/looks-like-rain-again-and-again.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 torrential rains}}}\uc2  and the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/04/science/flooding-of-coast-caused-by-global-warming-has-already-begun.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 tidal flooding}}}\uc2 . So then we had the \u8220\'20\'1CI am not a scientist\u8221\'20\'1D phase, with one lawmaker after another fending off climate questions with that formula.\par \par \uc2 That drew such {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/us/why-republicans-keep-telling-everyone-theyre-not-scientists.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 ridicule}}}\uc2  that Republicans critical of climate science had to come up with a more nuanced answer. Several variations on the new approach were on display recently during confirmation hearings for some of President Trump\u8217\'20\'19s cabinet nominees.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CScience tells us that the climate is changing and human activity in some manner impacts that change,\u8221\'20\'1D Scott Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general nominated to run the \uc2 Environmental Protection Agency\uc2 , {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/us/politics/scott-pruitt-testifying-to-lead-epa-criticizes-environmental-rules.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 told a Senate committee}}}\uc2 . \u8220\'20\'1CThe human ability to measure with precision the extent of that impact is subject to continuing debate and dialogue, as well they should be.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Let us ponder the craftsmanship of that second sentence.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWith precision\u8221\'20\'1D is the key phrase, of course, and it renders the statement almost axiomatically true. Do we have trouble taking the precise temperature of an entire planet and then divining, for a given period, exactly how much of the change in that temperature is caused by human activities?\par \par \uc2 Well, yes.\par \par \uc2 Anybody who did not know better might come away thinking there is room to doubt whether humans are the main cause of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/globalwarming/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 global warming}}}\uc2 . Mr. Pruitt did not actually say that, of course \u8212\'20\'14 nowadays, hard-core climate denial provokes a furious response from Democrats in Congress and mild protest even from a few Republicans.\par \par \uc2 Thus Mr. Pruitt and the other Trump nominees labored to avoid overt denial while signaling to their allies that there is enough doubt to justify inaction on emissions or even rolling back steps the Obama administration took.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThey\u8217\'20\'19re just trying not to look crazy, because if they look too crazy, then Susan Collins\u8221\'20\'1D \u8212\'20\'14 a Republican senator from Maine \u8212\'20\'14 \u8220\'20\'1Cand a few of the moderate Republicans might jump ship,\u8221\'20\'1D said Raymond T. Pierrehumbert, an American climate scientist who holds a chair at Oxford \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2 , in Britain.\par \par \uc2 In interviews, Dr. Pierrehumbert and several other experts said the public should not be fooled. The deep consensus among climate scientists, arrived at through decades of research, is that human activity is the cause of most of the planetary warming of recent decades, and probably all of it.\par \par \uc2 What is the evidence?\par \par \uc2 For starters, an {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://geosci.uchicago.edu/~rtp1/papers/PhysTodayRT2011.pdf"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 unassailable body of physics}}}\uc2  tells us that if you add carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, they will trap extra heat near the surface of the planet, a prediction so basic it was first made in the 19th century.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CPeople have been trying, but nobody has really shaken the foundations of the theory in all that time,\u8221\'20\'1D Dr. Pierrehumbert said.\par \par \uc2 Emissions have soared in the modern era, and as predicted, the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/earth_planet/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Earth}}}\uc2  is heating up. That would be obvious just from all the land ice that is melting, but of course, we have had thermometers for centuries now. They show that the Earth has warmed almost 2 degrees Fahrenheit since the late 19th century, a large number for the surface of a planet.\par \par \uc2 With just those facts, you have a powerful circumstantial case that human activities are the cause of global warming. But we have more: Sophisticated computer analyses of the climate confirm it, finding that no factor other than the human release of greenhouse gases is large enough to explain the recent warming.\par \par \uc2 What are the soft spots in the theory?\par \par \uc2 The biggest is that natural factors could in principle be causing the climate to change, as Mr. Pruitt implied. Suppose, for example, that the sun were to start putting out a lot more radiation; that would definitely warm the Earth.\par \par \uc2 But we have satellites keeping a close eye on the sun, and it has not changed nearly enough to be the culprit. Scientists have looked closely at all the possible natural factors, in fact, and they are not adequate to explain the warming.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COf all the natural drivers, and everything we know that works on long time scales that has ever affected climate in the past, all those things have been ruled out,\u8221\'20\'1D said Drew Shindell, an atmospheric scientist at Duke \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2 . \u8220\'20\'1CBeyond a reasonable doubt, it has to be human activities.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The most important uncertainties are not really about the cause of global warming \u8212\'20\'14 we are the cause \u8212\'20\'14 but in trying to forecast how big the coming changes will be.\par \par \uc2 If emissions continue at a high level but the Earth turns out to be less sensitive to greenhouse gases than currently believed, that would give humanity a few extra decades to come to grips with the situation. But it is not a get-out-of-jail-free card: If we keep burning fossil fuels in that time, scientists say the planet will still undergo profound, threatening changes.\par \par \uc2 On the other hand, if the Earth turns out to be especially sensitive to the gases and if we permit runaway emissions growth, some {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.pnas.org/content/107/21/9552.full"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 research}}}\uc2  suggests that huge parts of the world could eventually get so hot as to be uninhabitable by large mammals.\par \par \uc2 Recall that the large mammals include human beings. \u8220\'20\'1CPeople tend to think of climate change as not being of the same magnitude as nuclear warfare, but at the high end, it\u8217\'20\'19s arguably worse,\u8221\'20\'1D Dr. Pierrehumbert said.\par \par \uc2 So, despite some genuine uncertainties, the risks are extraordinary, and the moral case for action is pretty clear: We have to get to zero emissions, the sooner the better. Mr. Trump\u8217\'20\'19s nominees have so far displayed scant willingness to come to grips with that.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps surprisingly, though, the congressional hearings did offer glimmers of hope.\par \par \uc2 Rex W. Tillerson\uc2 , who won confirmation on Wednesday as Mr. Trump\u8217\'20\'19s secretary of state, implied that he might try to keep the nation committed to a big international {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/13/world/europe/climate-change-accord-paris.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 deal}}}\uc2  on climate change reached in Paris in 2015.\par \par \uc2 But the most interesting statements came from Rick Perry, Mr. Trump\u8217\'20\'19s nominee to head the Department of Energy. Under questioning, Mr. Perry, the former Texas governor, was surprisingly positive about the role the federal government might play in developing advanced clean-energy technology.\par \par \uc2 Many people \u8212\'20\'14 \uc2 Bill Gates\uc2  among them \u8212\'20\'14 see this as the most urgent issue. Renewable energy and greater use of natural gas are helping lower emissions in the short run, but if we do not invest heavily in research and development now, we may not have the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/03/business/energy-environment/climate-crisis-big-question-how-to-inspire-innovation.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 technology we will eventually need}}}\uc2  to get to zero emissions.\par \par \uc2 People like Mr. Gates and the entrepreneur \uc2 Elon Musk\uc2  are working on Mr. Trump.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 MEXICO CITY \u8212\'20\'14 In \u8217\'20\'19s so-called , cartel gunmen have often used their violent power to demand money from innocent people. It\u8217\'20\'19s a heinous crime that scars communities and blights growth, and it has provoked terrorized villages to rise up to chase out the extortionists. Now Mexico finds itself facing the biggest shakedown of all from north of the Rio Grande, as the United States president demands $12 billion to $15 billion to pay for a border wall.\par \par \uc2 This is not meant to be a jokey comparison. President Trump\u8217\'20\'19s insistence that he will force Mexico to pay is the definition of extortion: obtaining un-owed money through coercion. It is a dark moment in American foreign policy that has implications far beyond the southern border; it tells the world the United States no longer believes in fair play or the rule of law. Any officials involved in such a shakedown should search their conscience.\par \par \uc2 We are only now looking at this policy properly because most of us believed it was bluster. The of \u8220\'20\'1CWho is going to pay for the wall?\u8221\'20\'1D was effective at rallies, but we thought we didn\u8217\'20\'19t need to take Mr. Trump literally, especially with a suggestion as absurd as this. But he revealed his determination to carry it out with his tweet last Thursday: \u8220\'20\'1CIf Mexico is unwilling to pay for the badly needed wall, then it would be better to cancel the upcoming meeting.\u8221\'20\'1D This was no longer rhetoric to the fans but a direct challenge to another head of state, who had been scheduled to meet with Mr. Trump in Washington on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 The wall itself will be largely ineffective \u8212\'20\'14 most likely a fence that smugglers will climb over, tunnel under and drill through. If the United States wants to pour billions into such a structure, it can. But it is patently outrageous to force a neighboring country to pay for your own infrastructure.\par \par \uc2 President Trump claims Mexico should pay because it has an annual trade surplus of $60 billion with the United States.\par \par \uc2 The U.S. has a 60 billion dollar trade deficit with Mexico. It has been a one-sided deal from the beginning of \uc2 NAFTA\uc2  with massive numbers... \u8212\'20\'14 \uc2 Donald J. Trump\uc2  (@realDonaldTrump)\par \par \uc2 of jobs and companies lost. If Mexico is unwilling to pay for the badly needed wall, then it would be better to cancel the upcoming meeting. \u8212\'20\'14 \uc2 Donald J. Trump\uc2  (@realDonaldTrump)\par \par \uc2 This is utter madness. By the same logic, the United States should be paying billions to all the countries it has a trade surplus with, including Australia, the Netherlands, Singapore and Qatar.\par \par \uc2 The demand is especially perverse because the United States is so much richer than Mexico, which is the reason migrants head north in the first place. Mexico\u8217\'20\'19s to about $4 per day, and 28 million Mexicans can\u8217\'20\'19t afford a healthy diet.\par \par \uc2 President Trump has not made it clear how he will collect the money. The idea he floated of a 20 percent tax on goods coming from Mexico fell like a ton of bricks when it was pointed out that American consumers would be the ones paying. In the campaign, Mr. Trump released a memo saying the United States could force Mexico to pay by blocking remittances, the nearly $25 billion sent home by Mexicans every year, money earned from hard labor that supports the poorest communities south of the border. It has also been suggested he will try to tax those transfers. Either action would be challenged in the courts, especially as most of that money has already been taxed, and migrants would look for alternative ways to move it. But he might succeed in getting some of his funds this way.\par \par \uc2 A note in the executive order to build the wall may offer a clue to another fund-raising tactic. of the order demands that all the aid that has been given to Mexico over the past five years \u8212\'20\'14 probably around $320 million a year \u8212\'20\'14 be tallied up in a report for the president. Perhaps Mr. Trump is thinking of canceling future aid, or perhaps he\u8217\'20\'19s going to claim that the money sent in the past has to be paid back to finance his \u8220\'20\'1Cbeautiful wall.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 If Mr. Trump runs up the , he will be under increasing pressure to get back his wall dollars. And the way the wall is financed now could determine how the shakedown plays out. If Congress passes a bill to fund the wall, lawmakers need to force out any wording that commits to collecting the money from Mexico.\par \par \uc2 The demand that Mexico pay for the wall was the breaking point in other negotiations on trade and immigration. It was the issue that forced President into a corner, so he had no choice but to cancel his meeting in Washington. Money aside, it became a question of national humiliation.\par \par \uc2 But perhaps this idea of humiliating Mexico is what really appeals to President Trump and his most fervent supporters. As Mar\u237\'00\'EDa Eugenia Vald\u233\'00\'E9s, a political scientist at Mexico\u8217\'20\'19s Autonomous Metropolitan \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2 , said to me: \u8220\'20\'1CHe wants to make an example of Mexico to show how he will deal with countries around the world.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Shakedowns are cemented through violence. Behind Mr. Trump\u8217\'20\'19s rhetoric, many Mexicans sense the implicit threat of American force, backed by a history of occupations and wars. \u8220\'20\'1CThere is a real risk of the conflict turning into violence,\u8221\'20\'1D Ms. Vald\u233\'00\'E9s said. \u8220\'20\'1CThis man is capable of anything.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 I hope such fears are crazy.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Whenever an extremist in the Muslim world does something crazy, people demand that moderate Muslims step forward to condemn the extremism. So let\u8217\'20\'19s take our own advice: We Americans should now condemn our own extremist.\par \par \uc2 In that spirit, I hereby apologize to Muslims. The mindlessness and heartlessness of the travel ban should humiliate us, not you. Understand this: President Trump is not America!\par \par \uc2 I apologize to , the brave young Yazidi woman from Iraq who was made a sex slave \u8212\'20\'14 but since escaping, has campaigned around the world against ISIS and sexual slavery. She has been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize, yet is now barred from the United States.\par \par \uc2 I apologize to , a heroic Somali woman who has battled for decades for women\u8217\'20\'19s health and led the fight against . Edna speaks at American universities, champions girls\u8217\'20\'19 education and defies extremists \u8212\'20\'14 and she\u8217\'20\'19s one of those inspiring me to do the same.\par \par \uc2 I don\u8217\'20\'19t want to take Trump-as-an-extremist too far: He\u8217\'20\'19s not beheading anyone, and the security challenge is real. Nobody has a problem with improving safety, and Presidents George W. Bush and \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  both oversaw improvements in vetting. Yet Trump tackled the issue in a way that bolsters the ISIS narrative and thus makes us less safe.\par \par \uc2 In effect, Trump took a real problem, inflated it with hysteria, handled it with incompetence and created an unjust policy that targets seven mostly impoverished Muslim countries that haven\u8217\'20\'19t produced a single person involved in a lethal terrorist attack in America since before 9/11. Islamophobia swirls through the order, and \uc2 Rudy Giuliani\uc2  has helpfully that Trump asked him to devise a way to create a Muslim ban and \u8220\'20\'1Cdo it legally.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 There\u8217\'20\'19s a certain symmetry here.\par \par \uc2 I\u8217\'20\'19ve sat down in mosques in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Yemen and heard jihadists justify intolerance. Those men (always men!) \u8220\'20\'1Cotherize\u8221\'20\'1D infidels as fundamentally different, as threats who must be confronted; Trump \u8220\'20\'1Cotherizes\u8221\'20\'1D Muslims in a similar way.\par \par \uc2 Trump\u8217\'20\'19s national security adviser, , has referred to Islam as a \u8220\'20\'1Ccancer\u8221\'20\'1D and has shared a video asserting that Islam \u8220\'20\'1Cwants 80 percent of humanity enslaved or exterminated.\u8221\'20\'1D That\u8217\'20\'19s the mirror image of the bigotry I hear from jihadists who tell me that Jews were behind the 9/11 attacks.\par \par \uc2 The real chasm is not between Muslims and others, but between the moderates and the extremists of whatever religion.\par \par \uc2 found that many Americans approve of Trump\u8217\'20\'19s travel ban, but that\u8217\'20\'19s not surprising. The same was true of barring Jewish refugees in the 1930s, and of interning Japanese-Americans in 1942. When we\u8217\'20\'19re fearful, we\u8217\'20\'19re vulnerable to politicians who play on our fears and scapegoat immigrants; in the fullness of time, we come to regret our xenophobic behavior and to appreciate the immigrants.\par \par \uc2 So I apologize to Muslims. I have seen the worst of Islam, but also the best.\par \par \uc2 The newly chosen Rhodes scholars include a Somali refugee, , who was born in a Kenya refugee camp and was admitted to the U.S. as a 1-year-old. Raised by a struggling single mom, sometimes showing up at high school at 5:30 a.m. to study, he attended Cornell and won the \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s outstanding student award. Such people don\u8217\'20\'19t threaten us, but enrich us.\par \par \uc2 If we need an inspiring example of how moderates can successfully challenge extremists, consider an extraordinary Somali gynecologist, , who ran a displaced persons camp in Somalia, including a 400-bed hospital (and a jail for men who beat their wives). Islamic militants, enraged that a woman was running such an important enterprise, ordered her to hand it over. When she refused, 750 armed militants from the Party of Islam attacked the camp and ordered Dr. Abdi to run it under their direction. She refused.\par \par \uc2 Yet Dr. Abdi\u8217\'20\'19s camp, serving 90,000 people, was just about the only thing working properly in Somalia, and Somalis at home and around the world united to denounce the militants and speak up for her. The pressure on the gunmen grew. Finally, they slunk off.\par \par \uc2 If Somalis can stand up to extremists, we can, too.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, that is happening. When Japanese-Americans were rounded up, other Americans were silent. Today, it is heartwarming to see Americans of all creeds standing up against similar bigotry. In Victoria, Tex., after a mysterious fire destroyed the only mosque just hours after Trump announced his travel ban, local Jewish leaders a key to their synagogue. Four churches also offered their space for as long as needed, and in just a few days, people of all faiths contributed $1 million to build a new mosque.\par \par \uc2 At an airport protest, one showed a Jewish man and a Muslim man protesting side by side, each with a child on his shoulders.\par \par \uc2 My dream is of the day when Jews protest Islamophobia, Muslims denounce the persecution of Christians and Christians stand against anti-Semitism.

Inside, a golden football helmet with a fleur-de-lis overlooks portraits of Napoleon, hand thrust inside waistcoat, and the blues pianist James Booker, called the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.bayoumaharajah.com/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Bayou Maharajah}}}\uc2 , in eye patch and halo.\par \par \uc2 The menu is lit on a marquee, with bags of Zapp\u8217\'20\'19s Voodoo Potato Chips dangling below. Diners drink Abita root beer or coffee brewed with chicory, tasting of roasted earth. Each table is set with Crystal hot sauce, whose ingredient list puts cayenne where it should be: first.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Lathan grew up on the Gulf Coast of Alabama, in Creole country; his business partner, Clay Boulware, comes from Cajun central Louisiana. Once roommates at \uc2 Louisiana State \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2 , they reunited in New York a few years ago to redress the city\u8217\'20\'19s scarcity of gumbo, selling the dish at outdoor food markets before opening the restaurant in early December.\par \par \uc2 Some say gumbo is less learned than inherited. Mr. Lathan got his starter recipe from his great-grandmother Nanny, who passed it down to his father. It begins with a roux of canola oil and flour cooked just short of total darkness and fused with onion, celery and bell pepper.\par \par \uc2 His Cajun gumbo speaks in smoke, leached from andouille sausage made by a Louisiana butcher. The meat is browned until its edges crisp, then wedded with chicken poached in house-made bone stock. Broken-down okra helps thicken it, so much that it almost tugs back the spoon. The result is dense and warming, though some might wish for more fire.\par \par \uc2 For a Creole version, Mr. Lathan bypasses the tomatoes that sometimes divide it from its Cajun cousin. He relies instead on the sweetness of shrimp and blue crabs, which he gets live from Chinatown and coaxes into a stock meant to taste \u8220\'20\'1Clike you\u8217\'20\'19re at a crab boil,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 The dominant note is fil\u233\'00\'E9, ground sassafras leaves, which lends a flavor somewhere between root beer and camphor. I found it too strong, but for a friend from Louisiana, it was the taste that made him nod and say, \u8220\'20\'1CThis.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 A vegan gumbo aroused suspicions (\u8220\'20\'1COxymoron,\u8221\'20\'1D my Louisiana friend said) but turned out to be a Louisianian Roman Catholic tradition during Lent. It\u8217\'20\'19s made of as many greens as Mr. Lathan can get his hands on and thickened with only okra, no roux.\par \par \uc2 To me, it had a slight must from an over-suffusion of sage. Perhaps there is always quibbling when it comes to gumbo.\par \par \uc2 On the wall hangs a message dating to the New Orleans 1929 streetcar workers\u8217\'20\'19 strike, when the Martin brothers, who ran a coffee stand in the French Market, told the strikers, \u8220\'20\'1CWe are with you till h\u8212\'20\'14l freezes, and when it does, we will furnish blankets to keep you warm.\u8221\'20\'1D They also provided giant sandwiches that became known as po\u8217\'20\'19 boys.\par \par \uc2 Here the po\u8217\'20\'19 boys are made with loaves from Leidenheimer Baking Company in New Orleans, which have crusts as thin as the skin of a balloon, ready to fracture. They are swabbed with Duke\u8217\'20\'19s mayo, which eschews sugar for a more pronounced tang, and lined with tomatoes and pickles.\par \par \uc2 My first encounter went poorly. The bread was stiff and underdressed, the batter on the fried shrimp and catfish seemingly bereft of spice. But the next time, they were glories.\par \par \uc2 Best is one packed with roast beef, a beautiful sopping mess of Black Angus chuck, marinated in root beer and roasted for 16 hours. The remains of the mirepoix it is cooked with are pur\u233\'00\'E9ed and added to the drippings to make debris gravy, which \u8212\'20\'14 alone \u8212\'20\'14 might be worth pawning your soul for.\par \par \uc2 There are a few commendable sides: greens smoky-sweet from courting ham hocks and bacon, and fried green tomatoes crackly with bread crumbs from leftover Leidenheimer loaves. A Cajun potato salad had little presence, but I wondered if the point was to add it to the gumbo, as some Louisianians do.\par \par \uc2 If, after all this, dessert is still required, tiny bourbon pecan pies are fine specimens (another Nanny recipe). Beignets are rough, snowed under with confectioners\u8217\'20\'19 sugar, crunchy on the outside and chewy within. They puzzled the people at my table, who expected airy balls of dough.\par \par \uc2 So I ate theirs.\par \par \uc2 The Gumbo Bros\par \par \uc2 224 Atlantic Avenue (Court Street), Boerum Hill; 917-909-1471; {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://thegumbobros.com/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 thegumbobros.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Recommended Cajun chicken and sausage gumbo; roast beef po\u8217\'20\'19 boy; rice and debris gravy; braised greens; fried green tomatoes with r\u233\'00\'E9moulade; mini bourbon pecan pie; beignets.\par \par \uc2 Drinks and Wine Chicory coffee and Abita root beer.

Trump}}}\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s triumph in the United States election.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe cabinet cannot exclude the possibility that state actors might gain advantage from influencing political decision-making and public opinion in the Netherlands and might use means to try and achieve such influence,\u8221\'20\'1D Interior Minister Ronald Plasterk said in a statement. \u8220\'20\'1CWe\u8217\'20\'19re talking about actors that both have the intention and ability to do this.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Parliament recently discussed the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/us/obama-russia-election-hack.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 finding by intelligence agencies}}}\uc2  that the Russian government tried covertly to help Mr. Trump, and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/23/us/politics/donald-trump-congress-democrats.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Mr. Trump\u8217\'20\'19s allegations}}}\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 made without evidence \u8212\'20\'14 that millions of undocumented immigrants had cast ballots, costing him the popular vote.\par \par \uc2 Ronald Van Raak, an opposition member for the Socialist Party, demanded guarantees from Mr. Plasterk that the Dutch elections, set for March 15, would not be hacked \u8212\'20\'14 and said that if the government could not provide such a guarantee, it should resort to paper ballots.\par \par \uc2 In a report on Monday, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.rtlnieuws.nl/cookiewet?s=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rtlnieuws.nl%2Fnederland%2Fpolitiek%2Fmet-potlood-stemmen-onveilig-verkiezingsuitslag-eenvoudig-te-hacken"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 the broadcaster RTL concluded}}}\uc2  that the Dutch election would be \u8220\'20\'1Ceasy to hack,\u8221\'20\'1D citing interviews with experts and an in-depth investigation of the vote-tallying software the nation has used since 2009.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, Mr. Plasterk said the government was looking into the electoral system\u8217\'20\'19s vulnerability to fraud, but was taking pre-emptive action to remove \u8220\'20\'1Cany shadow of a doubt\u8221\'20\'1D about electoral integrity. So it will abandon the use of computer technology for vote tallying. Voting in the Netherlands, a nation of 17 million, will occur the old-fashioned way: Voters will use red pencils to mark paper ballots, which will be hand-counted in each voting precinct and then tallied across the nation\u8217\'20\'19s 20 voting districts. The results are then submitted to the central voting office and the nation\u8217\'20\'19s electoral council.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.cs.vu.nl/~herbertb/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Herbert Bos}}}\uc2 , a computer scientist at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam and an expert on election integrity, said it was essential that the country maintain a voter-verifiable paper audit trail, to allow voters to ascertain that their vote was cast correctly and to allow the checking of the stored electronic results.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIn the Netherlands the whole system was frighteningly insecure,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr. Bos said in an email. Although the country still uses paper ballots, \u8220\'20\'1Cthe rest of the chain, from the polling stations all the way to the announcement of the final election results,\u8221\'20\'1D has been \u8220\'20\'1Ccompletely computerized\u8221\'20\'1D since 2008, he said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CYou did not even need to be super sophisticated to manipulate the counts,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr. Bos said. \u8220\'20\'1CCould a foreign country such as Russia, China or indeed any advanced state do this? Oh yes. Easily. Will the decision to pull the plug on the computerized vote counting improve integrity? Yes. You need manual counting and a paper trail that is checked.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 He added: \u8220\'20\'1CElection results are the heart of our democracy. You cannot risk any of this. Even if the vulnerabilities were small, you do not want to take any chances. And in this case they were not small. And there were many.\u8221\'20\'1D As for elections since 2008, Mr. Bos said he could not be certain that no tampering had occurred.\par \par \uc2 Kees Verhoeven, a member of Parliament for D66, a centrist party that supports marijuana legalization, welcomed the government\u8217\'20\'19s decision but said that Mr. Plasterk should have acted sooner. \u8220\'20\'1CThe elections will be held in six weeks, and only now the minister sees that the software is not secure,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr. Verhoeven said, adding that election integrity is at \u8220\'20\'1Cthe core of our democracy.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Follow Sewell Chan on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  @sewellchan.Milan Schreuer contributed reporting.\par \par \uc2 Correction: February 2, 2017, Thursday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the institution where Herbert Bos, an expert on election integrity, is a professor.

Jerry Brown described as a major accomplishment of his first stint as governor.\par \par \uc2 In his recent resignation letter, the head of the board, William B. Gould IV, described the law as \u8220\'20\'1Cirrelevant to farmworkers.\u8221\'20\'1D He estimated that less than one percent of the agricultural work force is now represented by a union.\par \par \uc2 As chairman of the Agricultural Labor Relations Board, Mr. Gould was charged with overseeing the certification process of union elections. Yet Mr. Gould said virtually no workers came to the board during his tenure.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CDuring the entire three years that I was chairman of the board there was only one petition for representation filed by a union in the state of California,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gould says a major factor for the decline of organized farm labor is the fear that undocumented workers have of dealing with the government. Around half of the Californian agricultural work force is in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere is not only no incentive to complain but there is no incentive to become involved with government in any way,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr. Gould said.\par \par \uc2 California\u8217\'20\'19s agricultural industry is bigger than ever. It produces roughly a third of all fruits and vegetables grown in the United States and has about a third of the nation\u8217\'20\'19s farmworkers.\par \par \uc2 Philip Martin, a specialist on organized farm labor, paints a less stark picture than Mr. Gould of the plight of farmworkers.\par \par \uc2 Farmworker wages \u8220\'20\'1Chave gone up significantly,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr. Martin said, and some workers have the benefit of voluntary agreements that growers sometimes enter with their suppliers. The average hourly wage of farmworkers in California is around $12, he said, above the state\u8217\'20\'19s current minimum wage of $10.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Martin, a professor emeritus at the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of California, Davis\uc2 , says estimates on unionization rates among farmworkers in California are not very reliable because there are no government requirements to report them.

A leading scholar on racial equity in higher education, Dr. Harper will in July be leaving the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/university_of_pennsylvania/index.html?inline=nyt-org"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 \\b University\\b0  of Pennsylvania}}}\uc2 , where he founded and directed the Center for the Study of Race and Equity in Education, and joining the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Southern California\uc2 , where he will teach and start up a similar center with big ambitions.\par \par \uc2  One priority is a survey to assess the racial climate on the nation\u8217\'20\'19s campuses.\par \par \uc2 What is your reaction to the environment on campus following the Trump election and inauguration?\par \par \uc2 The uptick in reports of racial bias reinforces my argument as to why it\u8217\'20\'19s so important that colleges and universities be responsible for white students having access to a proper course of study in race. I was also struck by how many white people on college campuses were shocked to learn that there was so much racism in America. In fact, I use the election to address in my book why even the most educated white people were so na\u239\'00\'EFve and blind to the realities of race.\par \par \uc2 What prompted you to write your book?\par \par \uc2 I saw this as an opportunity to help people understand that universities didn\u8217\'20\'19t just all of a sudden become racist. They\u8217\'20\'19ve been racist and exclusive from the start. I wanted to call attention to both the problems and the opportunities. When I say the opportunities, I mean the opportunity to actually force higher education institutions to follow through on their commitment to diversity.\par \par \uc2 What makes you think universities breed racism?\par \par \uc2 On most predominantly white campuses, people of color are overwhelmingly represented in food service, grounds keeping, custodial roles and fairly low-paid secretarial roles; and they are tragically underrepresented among tenured faculty members, deans, provosts and presidents, people who are in power. This sends a message to black and Latino students that they aren\u8217\'20\'19t really valued. To their white counterparts, their expectation is that people of color work at the lowest levels of the organizations they lead. For example, the guys on the field are black men, but the coaches, commissioners and top executives at the \uc2 N.C.A.A\uc2 . are overwhelmingly white men. There is some real asymmetry there.\par \par \uc2 If universities fail to address these issues in a meaningful way, what are the long-term effects?\par \par \uc2 White people never thought before about their own underpreparation to even think about race, talk about race, and achieve racial equity. Companies and newsrooms say they want to achieve racial diversity but don\u8217\'20\'19t know how. This is extremely consequential for our democracy. Our conversation about race in higher education has to start to include white people and pay some attention to their preparation, because otherwise, we\u8217\'20\'19re going to continue to see an oversupply of white people in leadership positions in all sectors of our society and our economy. These are the people who will eventually shape public policies and teach future generations.\par \par \uc2 What about the diversity training campuses are offering? Doesn\u8217\'20\'19t that help?\par \par \uc2 The one-time talks during freshman orientation, regardless of whether it\u8217\'20\'19s an hour or all day, do not provide a deep enough course of study in race and diversity. It has to go beyond orientation.\par \par \uc2 In your book, you see diversity issues incorporated in the curriculum. That includes math. Explain.\par \par \uc2 Race studies continue to be incredibly compartmentalized. Ethnic studies programs tend to still be the only place where people can find a meaningful course of study on race. We absolutely need ethnic studies courses. But we also need for race and diversity to be thoughtfully integrated across the curriculum.\par \par \uc2 There\u8217\'20\'19s a real opportunity to get young people excited about math when you can situate the word problems in contexts that are culturally familiar to them. If you\u8217\'20\'19re teaching accounting, it might be that you have people learning through pro bono work with a local organization that serves communities of color.\par \par \uc2 How important is it that colleges and universities change their approach to educating students?\par \par \uc2 What actually happens in college to prepare people for citizenship in a racially diverse democracy? I want students to hold their universities accountable for making good on the promises that are found in mission statements and elsewhere about commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion and so on. And I don\u8217\'20\'19t want it to just be students of color. I want white students to also hold their professors accountable for not sending them into the world as what I term accidental racists.\par \par \uc2 Interview has been condensed and lightly edited.\par \par \uc2 Prof. Shaun R. Harper will be starting a new center on racial equity at the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Southern California. | Mark Makela for The New York Times \par \par \uc2 Document NYTFEED020170202ed220030m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 When I first met Yang Jinkai, two days before he boarded a plane for America, the smog hanging over his industrial home city, Shenyang, had turned the sun into a ghostly orb. The 16-year-old paced around the family apartment as his mother labeled his suitcases and packed them with the comforts of home: quilted pajamas, chopsticks, instant noodles. She gestured toward a lone memento that would remain in his bedroom, a life-size needlepoint portrait of her only child, woven in shimmering gold thread. \u8220\'20\'1CI worked on that all year,\u8221\'20\'1D she said. \u8220\'20\'1CI knew this moment would come.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Yang had never traveled outside China. But he had already chosen a new first name for his life in America, Korbin (\u8220\'20\'1CThat sounds American, right?\u8221\'20\'1D), and was daydreaming about the adventure ahead. \u8220\'20\'1CIt will be magical,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1CI\u8217\'20\'19ll make lots of American friends. I\u8217\'20\'19d like to have an American girlfriend. Maybe\u8221\'20\'1D \u8212\'20\'14 he shot a glance at his father \u8212\'20\'14 \u8220\'20\'1CI\u8217\'20\'19ll even get a gun.\u8221\'20\'1D Over the summer, Korbin had been working on his English by watching, perhaps too zealously, the American television series \u8220\'20\'1CCriminal Minds.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 To help Korbin escape the competitive straitjacket of the Chinese education system, his father had paid nearly $40,000 to an education consultancy to get him enrolled in a public high school in Michigan. The Yang family\u8217\'20\'19s ultimate goal was for Korbin to attend a top American \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2 , and the name of his new high school, Oxford, only added to the allure. It didn\u8217\'20\'19t matter that the place had no connection to the British \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2  or that this Oxford was a small town north of Detroit. \u8220\'20\'1CMy father,\u8221\'20\'1D Korbin said, \u8220\'20\'1Creally likes the idea of an Oxford diploma.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Even as U.S.-China relations have slipped toward mutual antagonism, the flood of Chinese students coming to the United States has continued to rise. Roughly 370,000 students from the mainland are enrolled in American high schools and universities, six times more than a decade ago. Their financial impact \u8212\'20\'14 $11.4 billion was contributed to the American economy in 2015, according to the Department of Commerce \u8212\'20\'14 has turned education into one of America\u8217\'20\'19s top \u8220\'20\'1Cexports\u8221\'20\'1D to China.\par \par \uc2 It is a strange historical moment when the elites of a rising power send their only sons and daughters, products of China\u8217\'20\'19s former one-child policy, to the schools of a geopolitical rival. Yet the idea of a liberal Western education exerts an almost talismanic hold over China\u8217\'20\'19s ruling classes. While the country\u8217\'20\'19s educational emphasis on rote memorization churns out some of the world\u8217\'20\'19s best test-takers, many Chinese families harbor worries that diverge sharply from those of the tiger parents of popular conception. They fret about the toll competition exacts from their coddled offspring; they wonder if their child\u8217\'20\'19s creativity is being stifled. Even President \uc2 Xi Jinping\uc2 , who is presiding over a crackdown on Western influences in China\u8217\'20\'19s schools, allowed his daughter to attend Harvard. According to a 2016 survey conducted by a Shanghai-based research firm, 83 percent of China\u8217\'20\'19s millionaires are planning to send their children to school abroad. The average age, according to the poll, has dropped to 16 today from 18 in 2014 \u8212\'20\'14 the first time it has reached the high-school level.\par \par \uc2 In 2005, only 641 Chinese students were enrolled in American high schools. By 2014, that student population approached 40,000 \u8212\'20\'14 a 60-fold increase in a single decade \u8212\'20\'14 and it now accounts for nearly half of all international high-school students in the United States. \u8220\'20\'1CParents realize that they have to start earlier if they want their children to get into a top U.S. \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2 ,\u8221\'20\'1D says Nini Suet, founder of Shang Learning, a boutique consultancy with headquarters in Beijing that charges $25,000 to $40,000 to help Chinese kids prepare for and apply to American boarding schools. \u8220\'20\'1CFamilies are looking for any edge they can get.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 As a new administration vowing \u8220\'20\'1CAmerica First\u8221\'20\'1D settles into the White House, there is uncertainty about how long this phenomenon can last. It already faces headwinds within China. A slowing economy has cut into family savings, and a depreciating currency makes American educations more expensive. There are also fewer Chinese students to go around: The population of 18-to-23-year-olds has dropped by nearly a quarter in the last decade.\par \par \uc2 But the exodus of Chinese students continues for now, driven not just by a push from China but also by a pull from the United States. For each rich Chinese kid who enters an American school \u8212\'20\'14 whether public or private, college or high school \u8212\'20\'14 the multiplier effect means that entire communities can be buoyed by the buying power of the world\u8217\'20\'19s second-largest economy.\par \par \uc2 That\u8217\'20\'19s the hope, at least. The reality is more complicated. Much of the money spent by Chinese families desperate for American diplomas ends up with the intermediary companies that connect them with cash-hungry schools. These matches have yielded unusual results. According to an article in Foreign Policy magazine, nearly 60 percent of the high-school students end up in religious schools, despite coming from the world\u8217\'20\'19s largest atheist state. (Their parents welcome the messages of safety, discipline and moral values that emanate from these faith-based institutions.) Another cohort winds up in what are effectively diploma mills, which confer visas and credentials but little adult supervision.\par \par \uc2 Public high schools are the newest frontier: Less than 5 percent of all Chinese \u8220\'20\'1Cparachute kids\u8221\'20\'1D (as they\u8217\'20\'19ve come to be called) are currently in public schools, but certain U.S. school districts have begun to rely on them to offset budget cuts and increase cultural diversity at the same time as private academies are reaching saturation points.\par \par \uc2 Few public school districts have deeper ties to China than Oxford, Mich., outside Detroit. In 2010, the town sought to create the first pipeline of Chinese students into a public high school, one that embodied its high school\u8217\'20\'19s motto \u8212\'20\'14 \u8220\'20\'1Cwhere the globe is our classroom\u8221\'20\'1D \u8212\'20\'14 even as it brought tuition money to the school. As the number of foreign students grew, other Midwestern schools sought to emulate Oxford\u8217\'20\'19s success. But when a Beijing education company proposed building a multimillion-dollar dormitory for Chinese students on the Oxford campus, a community battle ensued.\par \par \uc2 Chance put Korbin\u8217\'20\'19s family at the starting point of Oxford\u8217\'20\'19s experiment, in Shenyang. His parents grew up without proper educations in rural villages haunted by the memories of famine. His father, Yang Huaiguo, migrated to Shenyang and scavenged for scrap metal before finding success in the boiler-repair business and real estate. But he worried about Korbin\u8217\'20\'19s education and the almost unrelenting pressure to study for the two exams that determine a Chinese student\u8217\'20\'19s future: the high-school entrance exam, the zhongkao, and the \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2 -entrance exam, the gaokao. There seemed to be no way out, until Korbin\u8217\'20\'19s school opened an international wing in partnership with Oxford. The pitch was enticing: After spending 10th grade in the program, Korbin was guaranteed a place at Oxford High School for two years, until graduation.\par \par \uc2 His father insisted that this wasn\u8217\'20\'19t just about family prestige or future job prospects. \u8220\'20\'1CI also want my son to understand, in a way that I never could,\u8221\'20\'1D he said, \u8220\'20\'1Cthat the world is bigger than Shenyang, bigger than China.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 On his first days in Oxford, Korbin marveled at the blue skies, so different from northeastern China, and the absence of skyscrapers. All of America, in his TV-fueled imagination, was supposed to look like New York. Beyond its main street and century-old storefronts, Oxford (population 3,500) is a patchwork of gravel pits and horse stables, wooded subdivisions and a strip mall containing a single Chinese restaurant. Korbin\u8217\'20\'19s host family lived in a house on a leafy cul-de-sac, with two basketball hoops in the driveway and a trampoline out back. Suddenly Korbin had four blond American siblings and a host mother he called \u8220\'20\'1CMom.\u8221\'20\'1D His host father worked as an engineer in an automobile industry that blamed the loss of thousands of jobs in the last recession on a single culprit: China.\par \par \uc2 Korbin immersed himself in Americana: football games, big-box stores, even a Christian megachurch with its own rock band. He was hardly alone in his American adventure. Michigan has become a particularly popular destination for Chinese public-high-school students in the United States, and more than a dozen kids from Shenyang lived nearby. Even at Oxford, where Korbin and 23 other students ended up because their academic program in China and its agent, the BCC International Education Group, had partnered with the school, there were another 19 Chinese kids brought in by a Beijing-based company, Weiming Education Group. The two crowds didn\u8217\'20\'19t mix much, in part because most of the Weiming students lived in a dormitory at Rochester College, a liberal-arts Christian school half an hour away. Korbin felt lucky with his American home stay.\par \par \uc2 His life in America was very different from that of his predecessors. When the first Chinese students arrived in the United States in the wake of the Cultural Revolution \u8212\'20\'14 and later, after the 1989 Tiananmen massacre \u8212\'20\'14 many were so poor that they collected aluminum cans or worked janitorial jobs to survive. Today\u8217\'20\'19s Chinese students tend to be far wealthier than their American counterparts, particularly in public high schools. Even among the middle-class students at Oxford, the Chinese kids stirred up envy, and some resentment, by flaunting multiple versions of just-released iPhones. (Korbin had only one.) The Chinese boys carried hundreds of dollars in cash and often wore a different pair of designer sneakers \u8212\'20\'14 \uc2 Nike\uc2 , Puma, Adidas \u8212\'20\'14 each day. Korbin\u8217\'20\'19s Chinese housemate, Oscar Kou, who liked to talk about his father\u8217\'20\'19s fleet of luxury cars, spent several thousand dollars on a laptop so powerful that it blew out the fuses in their host family\u8217\'20\'19s house.\par \par \uc2 Making American friends wasn\u8217\'20\'19t as simple as Korbin had imagined. In the hallways at Oxford High School, whose student body numbers 1,845, the Chinese kids clustered together, chattering in Mandarin. Korbin longed to interact with his American classmates, but every time he tried, the conversations fizzled when he couldn\u8217\'20\'19t understand their cultural references or slang. Still, Korbin made no secret of his mission. \u8220\'20\'1CI\u8217\'20\'19m a Chinese boy,\u8221\'20\'1D he told his classes, \u8220\'20\'1Cbut I really, really want to make American friends. It\u8217\'20\'19s the most important thing to me.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Perhaps his best chance came at the homecoming dance that fall. As he walked across the floor under the spinning lights of a disco ball, Korbin worked up his nerve and asked an American girl to dance. She just laughed. Another girl, another rejection. Finally, the third entreaty succeeded \u8212\'20\'14 just as a slow song started up and the dancers turned into a tangle of embracing couples. Korbin\u8217\'20\'19s feet stopped, and his arms locked at his sides. \u8220\'20\'1CI totally froze,\u8221\'20\'1D he says. The girl drifted off to rejoin her friends, leaving Korbin alone, wondering if a Chinese boy could ever find his footing in America.\par \par \uc2 If your initial encounter with William Skilling took place in the Beijing Capital International Airport, as mine did, it would be easy to take him for a missionary. Dressed in crisply ironed khakis and a white button-down shirt, his short hair meticulously combed, he was headed to a dusty city in the Chinese interior. As superintendent of Oxford Community Schools, Skilling did see himself as a sort of evangelist for global education. On this trip to China, his 19th, he was reviewing plans for Weiming to build its multimillion-dollar dorm on land bordering Oxford High School. \u8220\'20\'1CIt will be the first of its kind at any American public school,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 For Skilling, a former high-school government and economics teacher, the dorm project was the culmination of years of networking with Chinese officials, educators and businessmen. His first foray into the China market came in 2008, when with the Chinese government\u8217\'20\'19s help he started what would become one of the largest Mandarin-language programs in American schools. Today more than 2,300 students in Oxford schools, K through 12, take daily classes in Chinese. \u8220\'20\'1CThe greatest challenge we face in American education,\u8221\'20\'1D Skilling said, \u8220\'20\'1Cis preparing students to work and live in a global world that is changing 24-7.\u8221\'20\'1D The Mandarin classes were also part of a local government plan to lure Chinese investment to southeastern Michigan. \u8220\'20\'1CThere was a reason that we, as a state, weren\u8217\'20\'19t making inroads into China,\u8221\'20\'1D Skilling told me. \u8220\'20\'1CThe Chinese knew Michigan was negative, blaming China for its woes. The way to turn this around was to pay China the highest compliment: by building a world-class Mandarin-language program.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Beijing returned the favor. In 2013, Hanban \u8212\'20\'14 the state agency that runs China\u8217\'20\'19s network of controversial Confucius Institutes, which promote Chinese culture, language and propaganda worldwide \u8212\'20\'14 recognized Oxford Community Schools as the \u8220\'20\'1CConfucius Classroom of the Year.\u8221\'20\'1D Skilling parlayed such recognition into sister-school agreements with 20 Chinese schools. Over the past seven years, at least 40 different Oxford teachers and administrators have visited China. One major deal was struck with Korbin\u8217\'20\'19s public school in Shenyang, which opened an international school for Chinese students, like Korbin, aiming to go to an American high school with a famous name.\par \par \uc2 With that deal, Skilling had lined up his first supply of Chinese students for Oxford. He also devised a way around the United States regulations that restricted international students to just one year in public high schools. By inviting a local college to sponsor the F-1 student visas for Chinese students in their second year, Skilling maintained that they could remain at the high school \u8212\'20\'14 and keep paying tuition \u8212\'20\'14 so long as they were also enrolled in and paying tuition for full-time college-level courses. The second year was important: Chinese families want their children to have enough time to prepare for the American college process. The \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  raised no immediate objections, Skilling told me. \u8220\'20\'1CThis had never been done before, so there were no regulations or road maps to follow,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1CThis was literally a blank slate.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Soon, Oxford was attracting Chinese companies with even bigger ambitions. In a trip to Michigan in late 2012, Weiming\u8217\'20\'19s president, Lin Hao, laid out a vision in which 10,000 Chinese students would enroll in high schools in the United States, starting with experimental districts in the American heartland. Weiming, which bills itself as one of China\u8217\'20\'19s largest private education companies, has followed a similar strategy at home, building 15 campuses with more than 30,000 students in nine provincial cities. As Lin told a visiting superintendent from rural southern Ohio: \u8220\'20\'1CIn China, we have an old saying: \u8216\'20\'18Revolution begins in the countryside.\u8217\'20\'19\u8201\'20\'09\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Within a year, Oxford signed a memorandum of understanding with Weiming that ensured an even greater supply of Chinese students \u8212\'20\'14 up to 200 of them annually for the next 20 years. For each student, Weiming would pay Oxford Community Schools $10,000 a year. It was a boon for a district facing budgetary pressures, but it was significantly less than the $40,000 that Chinese families paid Weiming for the full package of tuition, room and board, insurance and English-support classes. (The company says its fees have since gone down to about $30,500, as it competes for China\u8217\'20\'19s middle-class market.)\par \par \uc2 Weiming also offered American public schools a bigger prize. If the number of Chinese students reached a certain threshold \u8212\'20\'14 from 80 to 100 students \u8212\'20\'14 the company promised to build a multimillion-dollar student center and dormitory, at no cost to the school. As the Weiming contingent at Oxford grew, architects in Beijing and Michigan began drawing up blueprints for the dorm. Shortly after I met Skilling at the airport in the spring of 2014, he returned to Beijing to pore over blueprints of the proposed dorm with Lin. They met in Lin\u8217\'20\'19s office, which was designed to replicate the room where Chairman Mao met President Nixon in 1972 to re-establish relations between their two countries. The wall behind Lin\u8217\'20\'19s desk is covered with antique maps, one for each Chinese province where Weiming has built a school. It wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t be long, perhaps, before a map of Michigan adorned the wall. \u8220\'20\'1CLin Hao and I understand each other,\u8221\'20\'1D Skilling told me, \u8220\'20\'1Cbecause we\u8217\'20\'19re both visionaries.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The loudspeakers in Oxford High School started blaring halfway through Korbin\u8217\'20\'19s music-appreciation class. \u8220\'20\'1CThis is a lockdown!\u8221\'20\'1D a voice announced. \u8220\'20\'1CAn armed intruder has entered the building!\u8221\'20\'1D Korbin\u8217\'20\'19s classmates leapt from their seats and, crouching low, rushed toward the door.\par \par \uc2 Korbin didn\u8217\'20\'19t understand the commotion. His English had improved, but his vocabulary was limited \u8212\'20\'14 and the loudspeakers were always a challenge. He had gotten used to the rock music that played between classes, creating the kind of happy chaos that would never be allowed in a regimented Chinese school. But this time the tone was grave: \u8220\'20\'1CTeachers, secure your classrooms!\u8221\'20\'1D Korbin\u8217\'20\'19s confusion only deepened when the music instructor hustled everyone into the girls\u8217\'20\'19 bathroom next door. \u8220\'20\'1CHurry up!\u8221\'20\'1D she yelled. When Korbin made it to the bathroom stalls, the teacher locked the door behind him \u8212\'20\'14 and they waited, in hushed excitement, until the drill was over.\par \par \uc2 Later, Korbin laughed about the experience. He had nearly forgotten that his mother\u8217\'20\'19s fears about American life \u8212\'20\'14 the guns, riots, school shootings \u8212\'20\'14 had almost scuttled his chances of studying in the United States. His father had made a reconnaissance visit to the country before he started, largely to reassure his wife that it was safe enough for their son. The only dangers Korbin faced in Oxford came from his innocent campaign for American friends.\par \par \uc2 One day, a group of jocks and slackers invited Korbin into the boys\u8217\'20\'19 bathroom for a few puffs from an electronic cigarette. The initiation was unusual for a strait-laced Chinese kid, but he was thrilled to be part of an American posse. \u8220\'20\'1CCool kids never study,\u8221\'20\'1D he was told, so Korbin, until then a conscientious A student, eased off his schoolwork. He started lifting weights, thinking he might attract a girlfriend \u8220\'20\'1Cafter I build some muscle.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 But when his new friends began pressing Korbin to join in hazing other kids, he pulled away. He wanted nothing to do with shouting racial epithets at the school\u8217\'20\'19s few African-American students or taunting other Chinese kids with curse words in Mandarin. \u8220\'20\'1CI tried so hard to make American friends, but I lost all of my own Chinese style and character,\u8221\'20\'1D Korbin told me last year. \u8220\'20\'1CI am not that eager to be part of American culture anymore. I would like to be myself, Chinese.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 With this part of his American dream tarnished, Korbin buried himself in his studies \u8212\'20\'14 and emerged as a patriot. In September 2015, after Beijing held a missile-studded military parade to celebrate Japan\u8217\'20\'19s defeat in World War II, he posted a picture on social media of the Chinese flag with the words \u8220\'20\'1CGreat China!\u8221\'20\'1D At school, he nearly came to blows with a student who was badmouthing the Chinese \u8220\'20\'1Cdictatorship.\u8221\'20\'1D The object of his anger was not an American but a fellow Chinese student.\par \par \uc2 Korbin and Oscar left their host family and moved in with four other Chinese students under the care of a local grandmother. Korbin stopped lifting weights. He no longer wanted an American girlfriend. He barely interacted with American students anyway, because everyone in his college-level classes \u8212\'20\'14 the requirement to maintain his visa during his second year \u8212\'20\'14 was Chinese.\par \par \uc2 Still, Korbin remembers his senior year fondly. After he regained his academic focus, his grade-point average rose to near the top of his class \u8212\'20\'14 a 3.96 \u8212\'20\'14 and his standardized-test scores climbed just in time for his college applications. It felt good to be a nerd again. \u8220\'20\'1CI realized that I\u8217\'20\'19m an only son, the last of my family,\u8221\'20\'1D he told me. \u8220\'20\'1CMy parents pay a lot for me to come here, so why shouldn\u8217\'20\'19t I study hard?\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAre you here for the meeting about the Chinese invasion?\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 I had just pulled into the Oxford school parking lot when a bearded man in a baseball cap, an auto engineer, appeared at my car window and grumbled about the subject of that night\u8217\'20\'19s public forum: Weiming\u8217\'20\'19s plan to build its Oxford High School dorm. \u8220\'20\'1CIs it really our job to be educating Chinese kids?\u8221\'20\'1D he asked.\par \par \uc2 Until October 2014, Oxford\u8217\'20\'19s move into China\u8217\'20\'19s orbit \u8212\'20\'14 the Mandarin-language program, the influx of Chinese students \u8212\'20\'14 had met little resistance. But the proposed dorm for Chinese students hit a nerve. A board meeting erupted in chaos. The local newspaper, The Oxford Leader, ran an editorial titled \u8220\'20\'1CMaking a Deal With the Devil.\u8221\'20\'1D And now, as the engineer and 60 other residents gathered in the school atrium, Skilling found himself on the defensive. \u8220\'20\'1CI\u8217\'20\'19m here to defuse the situation,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 After touting the benefits of cultural exchange, Skilling outlined the finances. When the school reached its goal of 200 tuition-paying Chinese students, he said, an estimated $1.3 million in annual net revenue would flow into school coffers. The bigger incentive, he argued, was the multimillion-dollar dorm, which would include eight classrooms for use by all students. \u8220\'20\'1CWe don\u8217\'20\'19t pay a penny,\u8221\'20\'1D Skilling said. \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s a win-win.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Near the end of a contentious question-and-answer session, Skilling talked about how this project would bring money from China back into Michigan. \u8220\'20\'1CYou\u8217\'20\'19ve heard \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  say that China is trying to take advantage of us,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1CI agree. We\u8217\'20\'19re willing to sell our souls to get a foot in China, and it\u8217\'20\'19s a mistake.\u8221\'20\'1D A woman behind me whispered to her companion: \u8220\'20\'1CBut isn\u8217\'20\'19t that just what he\u8217\'20\'19s done?\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Behind the scenes, a group of Oxford citizens began looking into the international program. \u8220\'20\'1CI don\u8217\'20\'19t think the community objects to having foreign students here,\u8221\'20\'1D says Kallie Roesner-Meyers, a horse-stable owner who started the group, known as Team 20. \u8220\'20\'1CBut there was so much secrecy and misinformation around the whole China setup that we needed to find out more.\u8221\'20\'1D In the spring of 2015, Team 20, which sent the district a flurry of Freedom of Information Act requests, discovered, among other things, that the school board had agreed to a 20-year deal based on Skilling\u8217\'20\'19s recommendation.\par \par \uc2 In response to communication from Roesner-Meyers, federal agents questioned Skilling about his consulting work for Weiming. (Skilling says he ceased consulting before the Oxford deal went through.) One of them also wanted to know more about the visa maneuver by which Chinese students were staying for two years instead of one. According to Skilling, the agents said they \u8220\'20\'1Cdidn\u8217\'20\'19t see any issue,\u8221\'20\'1D and he told a reporter that Roesner-Meyers \u8220\'20\'1Cneeds to settle down.\u8221\'20\'1D But the pressure only persisted. Skilling retired later that year, and Weiming, without giving any explanation, put the dorm project on hold.\par \par \uc2 Weiming still has roughly 100 of its students at Oxford. And with thousands more students in its Chinese schools expecting to come to the United States, the search for a flagship location continues. In 2015, the company bid $12.6 million for a 58-acre property in West Hartford, Conn. It proposed to turn the former \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Connecticut\uc2  site into an international school for 500 students, some of whom would feed into the city\u8217\'20\'19s public high schools. Local officials supported the plan, but last May the City Council, responding to vocal opposition to a little-known Chinese company taking control of land in the city center, voted against it.\par \par \uc2 Hovering in the background of the West Hartford debate was the suspension of the Weiming dorm in Oxford \u8212\'20\'14 and the government\u8217\'20\'19s unresolved investigation into its international program. By November, the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  offered a verdict. The visa maneuver would not be permitted in the future, a blow to the model Oxford pioneered.\par \par \uc2 Oxford has not been punished, but it will no longer be allowed to keep Chinese students for more than one year on its campus. The current crop of 41 second-year Chinese students has been allowed to stay, though they must now take all of their classes at Rochester College, the institution that sponsors their visas, instead of Oxford High School. In June, after a semester of isolation, these kids will even earn their high-school diplomas. The future of the first-year students is up in the air. They may not be able to graduate from Oxford next year, and it is too late to re-enter China\u8217\'20\'19s gaokao system. So they and their families may be back on the international-student carousel, scrambling to find another school to attend next year.\par \par \uc2 The alphabetical seating at Oxford High School\u8217\'20\'19s graduation ceremony last June put Korbin Yang in one of the last rows, surrounded by a clutch of Chinese classmates whose surnames begin with the letters X, Y or Z. They formed a sort of school-within-a-school, watching the parade of American graduates they barely knew. Many local students received raucous ovations as they crossed the stage. Korbin\u8217\'20\'19s name \u8212\'20\'14 \u8220\'20\'1Cgraduating summa cum laude, Jinkai Yang\u8221\'20\'1D \u8212\'20\'14 elicited only a muffled clap or two. In the fall, Korbin headed to \uc2 Pennsylvania State \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2 . His parents were proud that he had gotten into a Top 50 \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2  where almost 2,500 Chinese students were already enrolled.\par \par \uc2 When I visited Korbin last summer in Shenyang, he took me to an American-style craft-beer pub his father partly owns. Over a game of pool, he spoke positively about his experience at Oxford. Still, he admitted, he left Michigan after two years without a single American friend. That surprised him. \u8220\'20\'1CWeirdly, I think the experience made me appreciate Chinese culture even more,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. It\u8217\'20\'19s a common sentiment among Chinese students abroad, who find that their foreign experiences sharpen their sense of national pride. Over the summer, Korbin started delving into Chinese history books and training in kung fu. In America, he found his Chinese core.\par \par \uc2 Now halfway through his first year at \uc2 Penn State\uc2 , Korbin can spend entire days without speaking a word of English. \u8220\'20\'1CI\u8217\'20\'19m around my Chinese friends all the time,\u8221\'20\'1D he says. \u8220\'20\'1CI can\u8217\'20\'19t get a chance to know American friends.\u8221\'20\'1D The current political climate may only isolate him further. Korbin is in America legally, studying hard and leaning toward a major in electrical engineering. But how welcoming is a country that increasingly regards his homeland as an economic and security threat? If Trump is serious about being tough on trade, Chinese students, while not in the foreground of such a fight, could be an easy lever for either side to pull. The collateral damage of restricting visas would be devastating, not only for the students themselves but also for high schools and universities, especially across the Midwest, that have become dependent on the billions of dollars the Chinese contribute economically every year.\par \par \uc2 An even bigger threat may lie within China. Late last year, President Xi\u8217\'20\'19s ideological campaign against foreign influences targeted the kind of schools that prepared Korbin for America. How this crackdown will affect the flow of Chinese students overseas is unclear. Parents may be compelled to send their children abroad at even younger ages to escape the closing cage.\par \par \uc2 For Korbin, the lack of American buddies and reawakened sense of national identity notwithstanding, high school in America still left a deep impression on him. Last Christmas, after exams, he went back not to Shenyang, but to Oxford. His second host mother gave him two hoodies and some of his favorite chocolate, and cooked a Christmas meal. Korbin presented her with a mug and played with the dogs he had helped care for as puppies. \u8220\'20\'1CI definitely wish I was still there,\u8221\'20\'1D he told me, and he sounded like just another first-year college kid, missing home.\par \par \uc2 Sign up for {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/magazine"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 our newsletter}}}\uc2  to get the best of The \uc2 New York Times Magazine\uc2  delivered to your inbox every week.\par \par \uc2 Brook Larmer, based in Shanghai, is a contributing writer for the magazine.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- It was at a campaign rally in August that President Trump most fully unveiled the dark vision of an America under siege by ''radical Islam'' that is now radically reshaping the policies of the United States.\par \par \uc2 On a stage lined with American flags in Youngstown, Ohio, Mr. Trump, who months before had called for a ''total and complete shutdown'' of Muslim immigration, argued that the United States faced a threat on par with the greatest evils of the 20th century. The Islamic State was brutalizing the Middle East, and Muslim immigrants in the West were killing innocents at nightclubs, offices and churches, he said. Extreme measures were needed.\par \par \uc2 ''The hateful ideology of radical Islam,'' he told supporters, must not be ''allowed to reside or spread within our own communities.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump was echoing a strain of anti-Islamic theorizing familiar to anyone who has been immersed in security and counterterrorism debates over the last 20 years. He has embraced a deeply suspicious view of Islam that several of his aides have promoted, notably retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, now his national security adviser, and Stephen K. Bannon, the president's top strategist.\par \par \uc2 This worldview borrows from the ''clash of civilizations'' thesis of the political scientist Samuel P. Huntington, and combines straightforward warnings about extremist violence with broad-brush critiques of Islam. It sometimes conflates terrorist groups like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State with largely nonviolent groups such as the \uc2 Muslim Brotherhood\uc2  and its offshoots and, at times, with the 1.7 billion Muslims around the world. In its more extreme forms, this view promotes conspiracies about government infiltration and the danger that Shariah, the legal code of Islam, may take over in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Those espousing such views present Islam as an inherently hostile ideology whose adherents are enemies of Christianity and Judaism and seek to conquer nonbelievers either by violence or through a sort of stealthy brainwashing.\par \par \uc2 The executive order on immigration that Mr. Trump signed on Friday might be viewed as the first major victory for this geopolitical school. And a second action, which would designate the \uc2 Muslim Brotherhood\uc2 , the Islamist political movement in the Middle East, as a terrorist organization, is now under discussion at the White House, administration officials say.\par \par \uc2 Beyond the restrictions the order imposed on refugees and visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries, it declared that the United States should keep out those with ''hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles'' and ''those who would place violent ideologies over American law,'' clearly a reference to Shariah.\par \par \uc2 Rejected by most serious scholars of religion and shunned by Presidents George W. Bush and \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 , this dark view of Islam has nonetheless flourished on the fringes of the American right since before the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. With Mr. Trump's election, it has now moved to the center of American decision-making on security and law, alarming many Muslims.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump has insisted that the executive order is not a ''Muslim ban,'' and his supporters say it is a sensible precaution to safeguard Americans. Asked about the seeming antipathy to Islam that appeared to inform the order, the White House pointed to Mr. Trump's comments in the August speech and on another occasion that signaled support for reform-minded Muslims. His administration, Mr. Trump said in August, ''will be a friend to all moderate Muslim reformers in the Middle East, and will amplify their voice.''\par \par \uc2 James Jay Carafano\uc2 , a security expert at \uc2 the Heritage Foundation\uc2  who advised the Trump transition at the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  and the State Department, said the executive order was simply ''trying to get ahead of the threat.'' As pressure increases on the \uc2 Islamic State in Iraq and Syria\uc2 , he said, ''tens of thousands of foreign fighters'' will flee. Some could try to reach America, perhaps posing as refugees, he said, so stronger vetting of those entering the country is crucial.\par \par \uc2 But critics see the order as a clumsy show of toughness against foreign Muslims to impress Mr. Trump's base, one shaped by advisers with distorted ideas about Islam.\par \par \uc2 ''They're tapping into the climate of fear and suspicion since 9/11,'' said Asma Afsaruddin, a professor of Islamic studies at \uc2 Indiana \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  and chairwoman of the Center for the Study of Islam and Democracy. ''It's a master narrative that pits the Muslim world against the West,'' appealing to Trump supporters who know nothing of Muslims or Islam beyond news reports of terrorist attacks, she said.\par \par \uc2 The executive order, she said, will backfire by reinforcing the jihadist line that the United States is at war with Islam. ''The White House is a huge soapbox,'' she said. ''The demonization of Muslims and Islam will become even more widespread.''\par \par \uc2 Those in the administration with long records of criticizing Islam begin with Mr. Bannon and Mr. Flynn. Mr. Flynn last February tweeted a link to an anti-Muslim video and wrote, ''Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL.'' In an interview, he said that ''Islam is not necessarily a religion but a political system that has a religious doctrine behind it.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bannon has spoken passionately about the economic and security dangers of immigration and took the lead role in shaping the immigration order. In a 2014 talk to a meeting at the Vatican, he said the ''Judeo-Christian West'' is at war with Islam.\par \par \uc2 ''There is a major war brewing, a war that's already global,'' he said. ''Every day that we refuse to look at this as what it is, and the scale of it, and really the viciousness of it, will be a day where you will rue that we didn't act.'' Elsewhere, on his radio show for Breitbart News, Mr. Bannon said, ''Islam is not a religion of peace -- Islam is a religion of submission,'' and he warned of Muslim influence in Europe: ''To be brutally frank, Christianity is dying in Europe and Islam is on the rise.''\par \par \uc2 Others with similar views of Islam include Sebastian Gorka, who taught at the \uc2 National Defense \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  and is a deputy national security adviser. Mr. Gorka's wife, Katharine, who headed think tanks that focused on the dangers of Islam, now works at the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 . Tera Dahl, who was an aide to former Representative Michele Bachmann, Republican of Minnesota, is a National Security Council official. Walid Phares, a Lebanese American Christian who has advised politicians on counterterrorism, advised Mr. Trump's campaign but does not currently have a government post. All four have written for Breitbart News, the right-wing website previously run by Mr. Bannon.\par \par \uc2 They all reflect the hard-line opinions of what some have described as the Islamophobia industry, a network of researchers who have warned for many years of the dangers of Islam and were thrilled by Mr. Trump's election.\par \par \uc2 They warn about the danger to American freedoms supposedly posed by Islamic law, and have persuaded several state legislatures to prohibit Shariah's use. It is a claim that draws eye rolls from most Muslims and scholars of Islam, since Muslims make up about 1 percent of the United States population and are hardly in a position to dictate to the other 99 percent.\par \par \uc2 ''The majority of Muslims don't interpret the Quran literally,'' said Shadi Hamid of the \uc2 Brookings Institution\uc2 . ''You can have five Muslims who all say we think this is God's exact words, but they all disagree with each other on what that means in practice.''\par \par \uc2 Among the most outspoken of those warning about Islam are Pamela Geller, of Stop Islamization of America, Robert Spencer, of Jihad Watch, and \uc2 Frank Gaffney Jr\uc2 ., of the Center for Security Policy.\par \par \uc2 All three were hosted by Mr. Bannon on his Breitbart radio program before he became chief executive of the Trump campaign in August. Mr. Gaffney appeared at least 34 times. His work has often been cited in speeches by Mr. Flynn. Kellyanne Conway, now counselor to Mr. Trump, did polling for Mr. Gaffney's center. Last year, the center gave Senator Jeff Sessions, who has warned of the ''totalitarian threat'' posed by radical Islam and is Mr. Trump's nominee for attorney general, its annual ''Keeper of the Flame'' award.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gaffney has been labeled ''one of America's most notorious Islamophobes'' by the \uc2 Southern Poverty Law Center\uc2 . The \uc2 Anti-Defamation League\uc2  describes him as a ''purveyor of anti-Muslim conspiracy theories.'' And even the Conservative Political Action Conference, an annual meeting of right-wing politicians and activists, banned Mr. Gaffney temporarily after he accused two of its organizers of being agents of the \uc2 Muslim Brotherhood\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In an interview, he explained his view of Islam, which focuses less on the violent jihad of Al Qaeda and the Islamic State than on the quieter one he sees everywhere. By his account, potential enemies are hidden in plain sight -- praying in mosques, recruiting at Muslim student associations and organizing through mainstream Muslim rights groups -- and are engaged in ''this stealthy, subversive kind of jihad.''\par \par \uc2 ''They essentially, like termites, hollow out the structure of the civil society and other institutions,'' Mr. Gaffney said, ''for the purpose of creating conditions under which the jihad will succeed.''\par \par \uc2 The day after the election, Mr. Gaffney told the Breitbart radio show how pleased he was with Mr. Trump's win. ''It is a great blessing literally from God, but also I think obviously from the candidate himself, \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 ,'' he said. He praised the ''superb people'' around Mr. Trump, naming Mr. Bannon and Mr. Flynn, who he said ''are actually going to lead us to saving the Republic.''\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 's politics and Washington coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.\par \par \uc2 LT.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- \uc2 Rex W. Tillerson\uc2 , the former chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil, was confirmed by the Senate on Wednesday in a 56-to-43 vote to become the nation's 69th secretary of state just as serious strains have emerged with important international allies.\par \par \uc2 The votes against Mr. Tillerson's confirmation were the most in Senate history for a secretary of state, a reflection of Democratic unease with President Trump's early foreign policy pronouncements that threaten to upend a multilateral approach that has guided United States presidents since World War II.\par \par \uc2 Thirteen senators voted in 2005 against Condoleezza Rice in the midst of a deteriorating Iraq war, and in 1825, Henry Clay was confirmed 27 to 14, the record for votes against until Wednesday, according to a tally provided by the Senate Historical Office.\par \par \uc2 In a brief swearing-in ceremony in the Oval Office on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump said Mr. Tillerson understood ''the importance of strengthening our alliances and forming new alliances to enhance our strategic interests and the safety of our people.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump added, ''It's time to bring a clear-eyed focus on foreign affairs, to take a fresh look at the world around us, and to seek new solutions grounded in very ancient truths.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Tillerson thanked him and promised to ''represent the interests of all of the American people at all times.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Tillerson is expected to appear at the State Department's Foggy Bottom headquarters on Thursday morning, when he will address department employees.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump's unapologetically nationalistic approach has put into question the value of many alliances and multilateral institutions. How Mr. Tillerson's translates Mr. Trump's vow of ''America First'' into the kind of polite diplomatic parlance that will maintain vital ties will be a significant test.\par \par \uc2 Among his other challenges are dealing with Mr. Trump's promises to recast relations with China and Russia, move the American Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, and re-examine an international nuclear deal with Iran.\par \par \uc2 In a White House briefing on Wednesday, Michael Flynn, the national security adviser, issued a stern warning to Iran. ''The Obama administration failed to respond adequately to Tehran's malign actions,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Tillerson, 64, a Texan, earned an engineering degree from the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Texas at Austin\uc2 , got a job at \uc2 Exxon\uc2  in 1975 and climbed his way to the top, leaving only last year. Neither a diplomat, soldier nor politician, he is an unconventional choice for the job, but has vast international experience.\par \par \uc2 With operations on six continents, \uc2 Exxon Mobil\uc2  is in some ways a state within a state. As its chief executive, Mr. Tillerson struck deals with repressive governments -- in at least one case, against the advice of the State Department. Environmentalists largely opposed his nomination.\par \par \uc2 But his views on international affairs are in many ways more conventional than those of Mr. Trump, which is why even Democratic-leaning foreign affairs experts said they welcomed his selection in hopes he would bring ballast to a turbulent administration.\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Rex Tillerson\uc2  will have the most demanding and complex agenda to face a secretary of state in a very long time,'' said \uc2 R. Nicholas Burns\uc2 , a Harvard professor and career foreign service officer.\par \par \uc2 Another crucial question will be how much influence Mr. Tillerson has on Mr. Trump. All cabinet secretaries must compete for power with White House aides who have long personal relationships with and frequent access to the president. But Mr. Trump's reliance on a close circle of advisers to write and vet executive orders while keeping departments that must implement them largely in the dark is without precedent.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump invited Mr. Tillerson for a private lunch at the White House on Wednesday, the first time Mr. Tillerson has appeared on the president's official schedule.\par \par \uc2 Mollifying allies infuriated by Mr. Trump's orders could be a full-time job. A ban on refugee arrivals and entries from seven Muslim countries, for instance, has enraged Iraqi officials whose cooperation is vital in the fight against the Islamic State -- a top administration priority. It has also infuriated many European leaders crucial to efforts not only in Syria, but Afghanistan and Libya as well, and it has tarnished what had been viewed as a successful trip by Prime Minister \uc2 Theresa May\uc2  of Britain, who on Monday said she opposed the ban.\par \par \uc2 Relations with Mexico have plunged to their lowest level in decades after Mr. Trump insisted he would build a border wall regardless of Mexican opposition.\par \par \uc2 The relationship with Chancellor \uc2 Angela Merkel\uc2  of Germany threatened to become toxic after Peter Navarro, the director of Mr. Trump's new National Trade Council, denounced the relatively low value of the euro as an unfair currency advantage for Germany.\par \par \uc2 ''Tillerson faces the most difficult task of any secretary of state in the postwar era in trying to reconcile President Trump's intention to make a stark break from decades of bipartisan consensus U.S. foreign policy leadership with the reality that, if he succeeds, such a break could lead to global chaos,'' said Ryan C. Crocker, who served as the United States ambassador to five Muslim countries.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Tillerson may also face difficult internal hurdles. Much of his department's top leadership has departed -- many because the Trump administration, like others before it, refused to keep political appointees. But the Trump transition team has been so short-handed and the pickings among Republican foreign policy veterans who had not criticized Mr. Trump so slim that dozens of positions are likely to remain empty for some time.\par \par \uc2 More worrisome, morale among the department's rank-and-file career officers has plunged, with a dissent memo against the administration's refugee and entry bans being submitted on Tuesday garnering more than 900 signatures, an extraordinary number.\par \par \uc2 Whether Mr. Tillerson meets these challenges with defiance or moderation will be a telling indication of his leadership.\par \par \uc2 Sean Spicer\uc2 , the White House press secretary, said Monday that foreign service officers ''can get with the program or they can go.''\par \par \uc2 Get politics and Washington news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and in the Morning Briefing newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Rex Tillerson and his wife, Renda St. Clair, with Vice President Mike Pence and President Trump, on Wednesday in the Oval Office.

Experts Suggest How to Adjust Your Media Diet\b0\par\par\uc2 By CHRISTOPHER MELE \par \uc2 1,047 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 February 2017\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 A cartoon circulating on social media captures the mood of many viewers and readers trying to cope with the current barrage of breaking news.\par \par \uc2 The cartoon, by David Sipress, shows a couple walking together, with the woman saying, ''My desire to be well-informed is currently at odds with my desire to remain sane.''\par \par \uc2 An everyday feeling these days... #DavidSipress #TheNewYorker pic.twitter.com/V6LMQ63vCR -- Upping The Anti (@uppingtheanti) January 30, 2017\par \par \uc2 It feels as if we are living in a Superconducting Super Collider of news, with information bombarding us at a head-spinning velocity. The result is a fatigue about the headlines -- lately about politics -- that has prompted some people to withdraw from the news, or curb their consumption of it.\par \par \uc2 Christian Livermore, an American writer living in St. Andrews, Scotland, said in an email that since the presidential election, she has been skimming instead of deeply reading the news.\par \par \uc2 ''At a certain point, there's a misery quotient that results from immersing one's self in the news, in the almost forensic detail of the suffering, and I have to ask myself, 'How does this affect my life?''' she wrote.\par \par \uc2 Experts said they had not seen data to conclude that consumers had changed their habits to protect their mental health, but added that the news ecosystem had changed drastically over the past five years, accelerating the sense of information overload.\par \par \uc2 Dan Gillmor\uc2 , a professor of media literacy at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at \uc2 Arizona State \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2 , said the number of news media has increased sharply, while there has been an ''incredible rise of the ubiquitousness of social media'' and sharing of news on platforms such as \uc2 Facebook\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''Things really are different,'' he said. ''There's just more stuff if we're online and paying attention. There's a lot to pay attention to.''\par \par \uc2 He added that in today's television news environment, the definition of breaking news ''means the latest thing we have to show you.''\par \par \uc2 Leslie-Jean Thornton, a journalism professor who is a colleague of Mr. Gillmor's at \uc2 Arizona State \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2 , said that even faculty members who by necessity were steeped in news needed breaks from it.\par \par \uc2 ''As journalism professors, there's a need and a desire to stay on top of things -- so much so that it becomes somewhat addictive for some of us,'' she wrote in an email. ''It's hard to step away, even for a few hours, but yet the constant wash of uncertainties is emotionally draining and physically harmful -- teeth damaged from being clenched in anger or frustration, skyrocketing blood pressure, heart palpitations.''\par \par \uc2 She added, ''I joke that we need trauma care, but I'm not really joking at all.''\par \par \uc2 Graham C. L. Davey, emeritus professor of psychology at the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Sussex in England, said in an email that many people followed the news because they did not want to be caught unaware.\par \par \uc2 ''These are the people with an intolerance of uncertainty, and are probably already anxious individuals, and are exactly the ones for whom negative news has a negative psychological impact on their own personal anxieties and worries,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 As consumers become satiated, the news media responds by increasing the ''emotionality'' of its coverage, meaning negativity is emphasized to keep customers engaged, he wrote.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gillmor has been a proponent of the ''slow news movement,'' named after the slow food movement, which maintains it is better for consumers' health to cook and eat more slowly.\par \par \uc2 ''We haven't been asking anything of the news-producing group, namely journalists, who I would strongly argue should be more involved in managing the insane flow of information and misinformation,'' he said. ''It would be better if we had an approach that said, 'Calm down.'''\par \par \uc2 How then best to cope with the velocity and quantity of news?\par \par \uc2 Some have found comfort in positive news, said Se\u225\'00\'E1n Dagan Wood, editor in chief of Positive News, a website and quarterly print magazine that highlights ''quality independent reporting that focuses on progress and possibility.''\par \par \uc2 In the 12 weeks since the election, visitors to the website have increased by 93 percent, and magazine subscriptions are up by 77 percent compared with the 12 weeks before the election, Mr. Wood said in an email.\par \par \uc2 Fear-based media does nothing for our emotional wellbeing. I'm following @PositiveNewsUK {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://t.co/JV6Fne7p6N"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://t.co/JV6Fne7p6N}}}\uc2  -- HolisticEmotionalHea (@EmotionsHealer) November 9, 2016\par \par \uc2 For those glued to the news, Curtis W. Reisinger, a clinical psychologist at \uc2 Zucker Hillside Hospital\uc2  in Glen Oaks, N.Y., recommended not reading or watching any just before bedtime because thoughts of how to respond to it can disrupt sleep. Better to watch sports or entertainment rather than the ''worry content'' of news, he said.\par \par \uc2 Nir Eyal, who writes a blog about ''behavioral design'' -- the intersection of psychology, technology and business -- said he habitually turned to campaign coverage to momentarily distract him from his work and escape from ''an uncomfortable reality.''\par \par \uc2 What he found, however, was that he traded one uncomfortable reality (the demand to get his work done) for another (the addictive quality of watching the news for fear he was missing out on something).\par \par \uc2 ''The solution became the problem,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 In a recent blog post, ''How to Stay Informed Without Losing Your Mind,'' he noted that ''online news is never done,'' adding that reading it left him ''overwhelmed, exhausted and anxious.''\par \par \uc2 ''The internet never says, 'You've had enough, now go away,''' he wrote.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Eyal has changed some of his habits; he has installed the News Feed Eradicator for \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and removed \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  apps from his iPhone, checking them only from his desktop.\par \par \uc2 He has also taken to reading a daily newspaper because editors select the top stories and spare him from reading ''the incomplete, incremental, second-rate stuff often published online.''\par \par \uc2 ''And when I physically turned the last page of the newspaper -- such a satisfying moment -- I felt as if I'd read enough to be informed for the day,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 If all else fails, and you still feel bouts of news fatigue, you can turn to \uc2 Twitter\uc2  for photos of cute animals.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020170202ed2200079\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The political ads warned that illegal immigrants were dashing, by the millions, over the Mexican border, racing to claim taxpayer-funded public services in California.\par \par \uc2 ''They keep coming,'' the announcer intoned over grainy aerial footage and a thrumming bass line. When viewed on \uc2 YouTube\uc2  today, these ads hardly seem the stuff of multicultural California as we know it.\par \par \uc2 In 1994, though, that message helped lift California's governor, the Republican Pete Wilson, to re-election. That same year, voters adopted a referendum, Proposition 187, denying state services to undocumented immigrants, including public education and health care.\par \par \uc2 California is often held up as a harbinger of the demographics -- and, Democrats hope, the politics -- of the nation to come. Mr. Wilson's bet against immigration is thought to have hurt Republicans in the long run in the state. But in the dawn of the Trump era, the state is also a cautionary tale of what happens during the tumultuous years when that change is occurring rapidly.\par \par \uc2 Donald J. Trump\uc2  has taken office in a nation that is not only growing more diverse, but also growing more diverse everywhere, because of both foreign immigration and shifting internal migration patterns that are touching the last bastions of nearly all-white America.\par \par \uc2 After an election in which Mr. Trump appealed to unease about the nation's changing identity -- and a month when he alarmed civil rights leaders and immigration advocates -- his presidency poses a very different question from his predecessor's.\par \par \uc2 Not: Are we post-racial? But: How will we handle the racial change that is only going to accelerate?\par \par \uc2 Sociological studies suggest that increasing contact between groups can yield familiarity and tolerance. But it can also unnerve, especially in communities where that rapid change is most visible -- and when politicians stand to gain by exploiting it. California lashed out at diversity before embracing it.\par \par \uc2 ''There's a very rich history of xenophobia, of racism, of trying to wipe each other out,'' said Connie Rice, a longtime civil rights lawyer in California. ''It's not like we were all of a sudden born the Golden State.'' State leaders pushed for the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. ''This is where the Chinese weren't even allowed to own property,'' she noted.\par \par \uc2 Rush Limbaugh started building his following as a right-wing radio talk show host in Sacramento in the 1980s. The '90s in California brought the Rodney King riots, a strict three-strikes law, the contentious Proposition 187 fight and ballot measures in which voters rejected affirmative action and bilingual education. ''We went through a pretty chaotic last 20 years,'' said Manuel Pastor, a \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Southern California\uc2  sociologist.\par \par \uc2 But this is the same state that today vows to defend immigrants from deportation, a place where voters have supported a higher minimum wage and prison reforms that benefit minority residents. ''You would not have predicted that from amid that chaos,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 The demographic change California underwent between 1980 and 2000, Mr. Pastor said, mirrors the change (and projected change) in the United States since 2000 and up to 2050, when whites are expected to be less than half of the nation's population.\par \par \uc2 ''The United States just went through its Prop. 187 moment,'' Mr. Pastor said of this presidential election. The question is whether the rest of the country can adjust faster to demographic change -- or with less conflict -- than California did. ''Why go through all of our pain? That was no fun, and it dashed a lot of people's lives. We underinvested in education. We over-imprisoned, so we got a lot of people locked out of the labor market. We broke apart a lot of families because of anti-immigrant sentiments. We did a lot of stupid things to ourselves.''\par \par \uc2 The Political Impact of Diversity\par \par \uc2 California's example suggests that the very demographic trend Democrats believe will benefit them in the long run could aid Republicans in the near term. At least, that remains true so long as Republican candidates like Mr. Trump or Mr. Wilson position themselves in opposition to immigration or policies perceived as aiding minorities.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump fared particularly well in the parts of the country where demographic change is accelerating. Scholars say that it's the change in diversity that helps explain how a community responds. So an influx of Hispanics into Chicago may not be noticeable, but a few new immigrant families into small-town Pennsylvania is.\par \par \uc2 Map the most diverse corners of the country, and historical gateways like Chicago pop out.\par \par \uc2 But look instead where the recent change has been sharpest -- typically starting with a modest number of nonwhite residents -- and a different set of places emerges.\par \par \uc2 While the top map includes Democratic-leaning counties around big cities, the Southern Black Belt and the Mexican border, the second captures many of the rural Midwestern counties that helped deliver Mr. Trump the election. A Wall Street Journal analysis found during the primaries that the most rapidly diversifying counties in a cluster of Midwestern states were more likely to vote for Mr. Trump.\par \par \uc2 In the general election, voters were more likely to shift to Mr. Trump in the counties with the strongest growth in the Hispanic and nonwhite populations since 2000, according to research from a coming book by Ryan Enos, a Harvard political scientist. It appears in survey data, Mr. Enos argues, that this shift in 2016 was driven by whites who had previously voted Democratic -- and who don't appear to have responded in the same way to rising diversity before Mr. Trump's campaign.\par \par \uc2 The long-term Democratic bet on demographic destiny assumes that minority voters who support the party today will continue to in the future. But it also assumes that today's white Democrats will stay with the party as the context around them shifts. Evidence like Mr. Enos's suggests there's no guarantee, particularly regarding the timeline of tolerance. White voters in California may have eventually been persuaded that their Hispanic neighbors were no threat to the local economy or their children's classrooms, but white voters in Midwestern small towns may have been unnerved by the change around them enough for a meaningful shift in votes in this past election.\par \par \uc2 Diversity, long considered a characteristic of big cities, has been spreading into rural America. The sociologists Gregory Sharp and Barrett Lee looked at nearly 10,000 smaller towns and rural communities across the country; more than nine in 10 experienced a rise in diversity between 1990 and 2010. That's happening because immigrants have followed new jobs in agriculture and oil and natural gas production, Mr. Lee said, and because they've been looking for more opportunity and cheaper housing.\par \par \uc2 But it's also happening because nonimmigrant minorities have been dispersing from central cities. And they're all moving to places with less experience incorporating difference.\par \par \uc2 ''Look at New York: For generations, one of its functions in some ways has been to absorb newcomers,'' Mr. Lee said. ''Contrast that with smaller towns in, say, the Midwest. While many of those at some point long ago had ethnic diversity -- there were Germans and English and maybe some Dutch mixed in -- they don't really have that kind of institutional infrastructure.''\par \par \uc2 The smaller towns may not have many classes in which English is taught as a second language, or elections with significant nonwhite voting blocs.\par \par \uc2 ''When I talk to people about their concerns about immigration, they often talk about language,'' said Daniel Hopkins, a political scientist at the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Pennsylvania.''They talk about being uncomfortable having to 'press 1 for English,' or seeing Spanish-language signs. They talk about the feeling of dispossession that comes from having lived for a long time in a community and seeing it change.''\par \par \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 That sense of lost identity and ownership echoes how white communities often reacted to desegregation, Mr. Hopkins said. It is not, however, abrupt demographic change alone that unnerves, his research has found, but that kind of change amplified by politics.\par \par \uc2 ''In this brew that generates anti-immigrant sentiment, there needs to be a politicizing factor,'' Mr. Hopkins said. ''There needs to be a politician, a set of politicians, or a party who call attention to immigration, who make it an issue.''\par \par \uc2 There needs to be, well, a Mr. Trump.\par \par \uc2 Does Contact Disarm Prejudice?\par \par \uc2 There is no neat tipping point, no level of diversity beyond which the backlash inevitably gives way to greater tolerance. The volume of political bluster matters. So does the level of segregation, because diversity doesn't necessarily mean communities are integrating. So does the kind of contact that occurs when different groups bump up against one another.\par \par \uc2 Research from the 1950s found that integrated military units reduced prejudice and stereotyping. And studies since then have shown that soldiers have more interracial friendships than typical civilians (as veterans, they're also more likely to buy homes in more integrated areas). But soldiers engage in a rare kind of contact: They live together, eat together and work together on common goals.\par \par \uc2 That's a different kind of contact than occurs when we pass strangers in the supermarket aisle, or encounter Spanish-language signs. And even in the most demographically diverse cities, there is often little integration of schools, neighborhoods and workplaces.\par \par \uc2 In Mr. Enos's earlier work, he found that white voters in the most segregated counties nationally were five to six percentage points less likely to vote for \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  in 2008 than white voters in the least segregated places, with a similar effect within states. That suggests that the nature of contact matters not just for disarming prejudice but for shaping politics. And often, when new groups come into a community, they immediately segregate.\par \par \uc2 ''That happens very quickly, and you have this period where you have the worst possible circumstances for intergroup relations,'' Mr. Enos said. A new, growing group raises threat levels for longtime residents. And with segregation and without enough time, the two have little chance for positive interaction. ''Who knows how long that time lasts,'' Mr. Enos said, ''but at some point that worst possible circumstance eases.''\par \par \uc2 California moves on as Arizona, with its later waves of demographic change, takes up the vanguard of anti-immigration politics. Communities develop the institutions they lacked. The political advantages of exploiting change recede.\par \par \uc2 In another study, Mr. Enos found that the mere presence of a few Spanish speakers on a train platform was enough to raise anti-immigrant sentiment among commuters in the white, liberal Boston suburbs. But as the same Spanish speakers kept appearing over two weeks, those attitudes softened. The commuters began to smile at one another.\par \par \uc2 ''In the short run, diversity is difficult,'' said Robert Putnam, a Harvard sociologist. He published a widely discussed paper in 2007 arguing that diversity causes groups to withdraw from one another, both from people who don't look like us and -- surprisingly -- from those who do (people generally ''pull in like a turtle,'' he wrote). His data suggesting that diversity reduces trust and social capital was cited by opponents of affirmative action. But in his full argument, Mr. Putnam too insisted that the trouble eventually ebbs.\par \par \uc2 ''In the long run, America is pretty good at coming to terms with that and moving past it,'' he said. ''But the long term is measured in terms of decades.''\par \par \uc2 It may be measured in the difference between where California is today and where the country is about to go.\par \par \uc2 The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 A speech by the divisive right-wing editor Milo Yiannopoulos at the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of California, Berkeley\uc2 , was canceled on Wednesday night after demonstrators set fires and threw objects at buildings to protest his appearance.\par \par \uc2 The \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2  announced the cancellation on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  around 9:15 p.m., about an hour after a section of the campus erupted in protest. There were no immediate reports of arrests or injuries.\par \par \uc2 All buildings on campus were in a lockdown, and the \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2  police said on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  that those on campus should ''shelter in place.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Yiannopoulos, an editor at Breitbart News, is known for his gleeful attacks on political correctness that can sometimes veer into offensive and racially charged language.\par \par \uc2 Notably, he was barred from \uc2 Twitter\uc2  for inciting trolls to attack the ''Ghostbusters'' actress Leslie Jones.\par \par \uc2 His flamethrower approach has aroused a fierce backlash. His scheduled speech at U.C. Davis last month devolved into a tense standoff between protesters and the police. It was called off before it could begin over security concerns.\par \par \uc2 On \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , the Berkeley campus police described the episode on Wednesday night as ''major protest attacks'' and urged people to stay away. Crowds lingered despite police orders to disperse.\par \par \uc2 On \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , Mr. Yiannopoulos said he had been evacuated from the campus after ''violent left-wing protesters tore down barricades, lit fires, threw rocks and Roman candles at the windows and breached the ground floor of the building.''\par \par \uc2 He added, ''One thing we do know for sure: The Left is absolutely terrified of free speech and will do literally anything to shut it down.''\par \par \uc2 A portable high-intensity light, the kind used on construction sites, was set afire, according to an image on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Demo protesting Milo Yiannopoulos at @UCBerkeley has gotten a bit out of hand pic.twitter.com/drFjqiFkAL -- JesusCamposHernandez (@superzusgw) February 2, 2017\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020170202ed2200076\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, The Chronicle of Higher Education reported that \uc2 Jerry Falwell Jr\uc2 ., president of Liberty \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2 , would lead a Trump administration task force charged with deregulating American higher education.\par \par \uc2 In describing his goals, Mr. Falwell focused on rolling back a series of initiatives that the Obama administration viewed as preventing abuses by predatory for-profit colleges. ''The goal is to pare it back and give colleges and their accrediting agencies more leeway in governing their affairs,'' Mr. Falwell told a Chronicle reporter.\par \par \uc2 One nonprofit \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2  that could benefit from this kind of regulatory retrenchment is \uc2 Liberty \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  itself.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Falwell alluded to two Obama initiatives: tightened standards for accrediting organizations that grant colleges access to federal financial aid, and new regulations that govern how students who have been cheated by fraudulent colleges can have their student loans forgiven.\par \par \uc2 The Obama accreditation standards were used last summer to shut down the accrediting organization that oversaw the corporate chains ITT Tech and Corinthian Colleges, both of which collapsed in bankruptcy after allegations of wrongdoing. The same organization oversaw numerous other for-profit schools with a history of high student loan default rates and deceit.\par \par \uc2 The Department of Education then created regulations to aid students who had been left holding large loan balances and worthless diplomas. In addition to granting those students debt relief, the department issued new college performance standards, devised to prevent future fraud from occurring.\par \par \uc2 Some fraudulent colleges made enormous sums of money by enrolling tens of thousands of students online -- an approach that can provide many benefits when done well, but also creates potential for abuse.\par \par \uc2 It makes sense that President Trump would turn to Mr. Falwell for advice in this area. \uc2 Liberty \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  provided a prominent platform for Mr. Trump to reach evangelical Christians early in the G.O.P. primary campaign.\par \par \uc2 And \uc2 Liberty\uc2 , at first glance, isn't in the same category as for-profit colleges. It enrolls about 14,000 students, most of whom are evangelical Christians, at its residential campus in Lynchburg, Va. But it also enrolls an additional 65,000 students online. Most colleges now have a mix of residential and online students, but it's almost unheard-of to have four times as many online students as residential students.\par \par \uc2 Because internet courses are cheap to deliver at scale, the online division is a big revenue driver for Liberty, which brought in $591 million in tuition in 2013, against $470 million in expenses. \uc2 Liberty\uc2  is essentially a medium-size nonprofit college that owns a huge for-profit college.\par \par \uc2 The giant for-profit \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Phoenix\uc2  enrolls more online students (over 100,000) than any other college. The second-largest online enrollment is at \uc2 Liberty\uc2 . Financially, the main difference between the two is that \uc2 Liberty\uc2  doesn't pay taxes. \uc2 Liberty\uc2 's marketing and recruitment are driven by an 800-person telemarketing call center in a former \uc2 Sears\uc2  department store near the main campus.\par \par \uc2 Most of the tuition for \uc2 Liberty\uc2 's online students comes from financial aid provided by the federal Department of Education, the same body that Mr. Falwell says is engaged in ''overreaching regulation.''\par \par \uc2 In 2015, \uc2 Liberty\uc2  received $347 million from federal undergraduate grant and loan programs. Few other private nonprofit colleges receive anything like that sum. To put the amount in perspective, the highly regarded \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Virginia\uc2 , a nearby state \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2 , received $37 million from the same sources that year. Arizona State, the nation's largest public \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2 , received $169 million. \uc2 Liberty\uc2 's considerable financial success -- it has built a $1 billion cash reserve, and Mr. Falwell is paid more than $900,000 a year -- was underwritten largely by the federal taxpayer.\par \par \uc2 Unfortunately, many \uc2 Liberty\uc2  students are struggling to repay their federal loans. Around 9 percent default within three years of graduating, ruining their credit ratings and creating financial burdens nearly impossible to discharge in bankruptcy. Among all private nonprofit four-year colleges, the average default rate is 6.5 percent.\par \par \uc2 Most \uc2 Liberty\uc2  students avoid default, but many are making no progress in reducing their loan balances. Only 38 percent of \uc2 Liberty\uc2  borrowers manage to pay down as little as one dollar on their student loan principal within three years of leaving school. This is probably because many struggle to land well-paying jobs. Forty-one percent of former \uc2 Liberty\uc2  students earn less than $25,000 per year -- the typical salary for people with only a high school diploma at age 25 -- six years after entering college.\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration's borrower protections require for-profit colleges with loan repayment rates below 50 percent to prominently note this fact, like lung cancer warnings on the side of a cigarette package, in promotional materials. The label must read, verbatim, ''\uc2 U.S. Department of Education\uc2  Warning: A majority of recent student loan borrowers at this school are not paying down their loans.''\par \par \uc2 Because it is technically a nonprofit (albeit a very profitable one), \uc2 Liberty\uc2  is exempt from these rules. But the fact remains that Mr. Falwell seems bent on repealing regulations that, in the standards they set for minimally acceptable results, paint his own \b \highlight22\uc2 university\b0 \highlight\uc2  in a bad light. And because it is exempt from for-profit regulations, \uc2 Liberty\uc2  is ultimately accountable only to state regulators and the college's accrediting organization.\par \par \uc2 If Mr. Falwell's task force does indeed recommend rolling back the tougher accrediting standards pushed by the Department of Education, it will heighten a continuing debate in higher education about the optimal balance between government oversight and individual choice among consumers and colleges. Some Republican lawmakers have called for scaling back what Senator Lamar Alexander, the Senate's education committee chairman, has called ''a jungle of red tape.'' Democrats like Senator Elizabeth Warren, by contrast, criticized the Obama administration for not going far enough to protect students.\par \par \uc2 But the Trump task force that Mr. Falwell is planning to spearhead does not appear to be focused on any kind of middle ground.\par \par \uc2 The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Men whose prostate cancer comes back after surgery are more likely to survive if, along with the usual radiation, they also take drugs to block male hormones.\par \par \uc2 The finding, published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, comes from a long-running study that experts say will help clarify treatment for many patients.\par \par \uc2 After surgery to remove the prostate, more than 30 percent of men have a recurrence, and until now there has not been clear evidence about the best way to stop the disease from killing them. Most are given radiation, but prescribing drugs to counter the effects of male hormones has been inconsistent.\par \par \uc2 The study, paid for by the \uc2 National Cancer Institute\uc2 , showed that among men who received radiation and hormonal treatment, 76.3 percent were still alive after 12 years, compared to 71.3 percent who had radiation alone.\par \par \uc2 At 12 years, the men who had both treatments were also much less likely to have died from their prostate cancer -- 5.8 percent versus 13.4 percent -- or to have the cancer spread around their bodies -- 14.5 percent versus 23 percent.\par \par \uc2 ''This is a big deal,'' said \uc2 Dr. Ian M. Thompson Jr\uc2 ., of the \uc2 Christus Santa Rosa Health System\uc2  in San Antonio, who was not part of the study but wrote an editorial accompanying it.\par \par \uc2 ''There are so many things we do in prostate cancer that we don't know if they make a big difference in survival. This is one of the things where now we can say for sure.''\par \par \uc2 He added that he hoped the findings would change medical practice.\par \par \uc2 The medical term for blocking male hormones is chemical castration, and the treatments can cause hot flashes, sexual problems and other side effects. So to put a man through it, said Dr. Anthony L. Zietman, an author of the study, ''you'd better have some decent justification.''\par \par \uc2 Dr. David F. Penson, the chairman of urologic surgery at Vanderbilt \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  Medical Center, said the study ''gives more credence to the concept that you have to treat the whole patient,'' rather than just irradiating the area where the cancer used to be.\par \par \uc2 He said the idea of blocking hormones in men like those in the study was finding its way into medical practice.\par \par \uc2 About 161,360 new cases of prostate cancer and 26,730 deaths are expected in the United States in 2017, according to the \uc2 American Cancer Society\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The average age at diagnosis is 66. Globally, there were 1.1 million cases and 307,000 deaths in 2012, the most recent data available from the \uc2 World Health Organization\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The study, begun in 1998 and led by Dr. William U. Shipley, a radiation oncologist at the \uc2 Massachusetts General Hospital\uc2 , had an ambitious goal: to follow the patients long enough to find out whether hormone-blocking treatment would affect their survival.\par \par \uc2 Prostate cancer grows slowly, so it took well over a decade for answers to emerge. Researchers and patients from 150 sites in North America participated. The patients were 760 men who had their prostates removed for cancer that had not spread, but who then had a sign of recurrence -- a rise in their blood levels of prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, a protein associated with prostate cancer. The men in the study had PSAs of 0.2 to 4 nanograms per milliliter.\par \par \uc2 ''That's just like the first wisp of smoke,'' said Dr. Zietman, who is a professor of radiation oncology at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. ''There'll be fire someday.''\par \par \uc2 The fire might take five, 10 or 15 years to break out, but Dr. Zietman said, ''Many are in their 50s or 60s, and will live long enough to get into trouble.''\par \par \uc2 The traditional practice for a rising PSA after surgery has been to give radiation, which targets only the pelvis.\par \par \uc2 The idea of the study was to add hormonal treatment, which might stop minute clumps of cancer that had spread to other parts of the body.\par \par \uc2 All the men in the study had radiation for six and a half weeks. For two years, half also received a hormone-blocking drug, bicalutamide, and the other half were given placebos. They were followed, on average, for about 13 years.\par \par \uc2 ''This is the first trial that's shown, if you follow these patients long enough, there is a real difference,'' Dr. Zietman said. ''More people survive 15 years later.''\par \par \uc2 Men who had more aggressive cancers -- reflected by higher PSA readings after surgery and by the pathology and surgical reports on their tumors -- had the most to gain from the hormone-blocking treatment.\par \par \uc2 The results do not mean that every man with a rising PSA after surgery should have hormone treatment, Dr. Zietman said. Men 75 or older may not need it, because they may die from other causes before the cancer can catch up with them.\par \par \uc2 ''But if they're younger and with a longer life expectancy, treatment is reasonable,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Bicalutamide causes men to develop breasts and potentially other problems, and the high dose given in the study is no longer used in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Other hormone-blocking drugs like Lupron have mostly taken its place, and may be even more effective, Dr. Zietman said. The study proved the concept that hormone blocking increases survival, he added, so other drugs that do the same thing should also help patients live longer.\par \par \uc2 Another study in progress in Canada and Europe uses the newer drugs, and is trying to determine whether taking them for six months, rather than two years, might be enough.\par \par \uc2 Like the Science Times page on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 . | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020170202ed2200064\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 In nominating Judge Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, President Trump chose a jurist who closely shares the conservative legal philosophy of Justice Antonin Scalia, the man whose seat he would fill if confirmed, according to a study analyzing the ideologies of potential nominees.\par \par \uc2 Judge Gorsuch, 49, is also ''interesting because he looks most like the current justices, putting ideology aside,'' Lee Epstein of Washington \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2 , one of the report's authors, said, noting his degrees from Ivy League universities and a clerkship at the Supreme Court. ''He's a nominee it's going to be hard not to confirm.''\par \par \uc2 The authors predict Judge Gorsuch, a federal appeals court judge in Denver, would be a reliable conservative, ''voting to limit gay rights, uphold restrictions on abortion and invalidate affirmative action programs.''\par \par \uc2 Should he be confirmed, the court will return to a familiar dynamic, with Justice \uc2 Anthony M. Kennedy\uc2  holding the decisive vote in many closely divided cases.\par \par \uc2 ''He's probably one of the least likely to drift once he got on the court,'' Ms. Epstein said of Judge Gorsuch.\par \par \uc2 The study, ''President-Elect Trump and his Possible Justices,'' was prepared by Ms. Epstein, Andrew D. Martin of the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Michigan\uc2  and \uc2 Kevin Quinn\uc2  of the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of California, Berkeley\uc2 , and updates an earlier analysis. It uses a common and reliable political science measurement to make predictions about potential nominees. Current justice ideology is measured using Martin-Quinn scores, which are based on voting patterns.\par \par \uc2 CHART: Ideology of Current and Potential Justices \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020170202ed220006d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 When the ancestors of Darwin's finches arrived on the Gal\u225\'00\'E1pagos two million years ago, they gained access to a world of new morsels, untapped by other animals. In a relatively short period, 14 species of finches evolved, specializing in different diets through different beak shapes: short for crushing seeds, sharp for catching insects, long for probing cactus flowers and so on.\par \par \uc2 This rapid diversification in the presence of new opportunity is called adaptive radiation. Studies of small island bird and lizard populations describe a fast burst of evolution, followed by a slowdown. But broader research has failed to find this fast-then-slow pattern of evolution on a global scale.\par \par \uc2 An international team of researchers set out to investigate this seeming paradox through a particular trait: the shapes of birds' bills. Analyzing more than 2,000 species of birds, the researchers suggest in a report published Wednesday in Nature that even though evolution does not slow down globally, the theory of adaptive radiation holds up.\par \par \uc2 In the case of birds, it is not that evolution slows over time, but rather it switches from generating major changes in beak shape to producing smaller iterations of the same basic shapes, said Gavin Thomas, a professor of animal and plant sciences at the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Sheffield in Britain and an author of the paper.\par \par \uc2 In their study, Dr. Thomas and collaborators collected 3-D scans of bird beaks from museum specimens representing more than 97 percent of present-day birds. Through a website called Mark My Bird, they asked the public to help mark out specific features on the scans, including the tip, midline and curvature of each bill.\par \par \uc2 By combining these beak shape measurements with the latest DNA-based evolutionary trees, the scientists were able to infer ancestral bill shapes and rates of evolution going back more than 80 million years.\par \par \uc2 Their data suggested that most of the variation we see in beaks today evolved long ago, in a relatively short period of time. ''Very early on, in the first 20 million years or so of modern bird evolutionary history, you develop a wide range of bird morphologies, with all kinds of extremes,'' Dr. Thomas said.\par \par \uc2 After this early proliferation, the scientists believe, there was a switch to finer-tuned evolution, which can still be fast-paced. In Hawaii, a single ancestor exploded into at least 54 species of colorful songbirds called honeycreepers. In Madagascar, 22 species of vanga birds emerged. Catastrophes like volcanic explosions possibly opened up opportunities for local evolution as well.\par \par \uc2 ''In these cases, we find high rates of evolution, meaning when we compare sister species, they tend to be very different from one another,'' Dr. Thomas said. But often, the different bill shapes that evolve are similar to those that already exist elsewhere in the world.\par \par \uc2 This explains how, even though beak forms experienced the greatest increase in variation in the early days of birds, rates of evolution stayed relatively stable through time: Isolated groups can still evolve rapidly, just without adding much that is substantially new to the range of bill shapes found around the world.\par \par \uc2 A remaining question is is what limits the total range of beak shapes, said Luke Harmon, a professor of biology at the \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Idaho who was not involved in the research. It may be that genes constrain how birds can develop, or that the niches birds could fill with different beaks are already occupied by other animals.\par \par \uc2 The research also shows how much can be learned about evolution by studying common anatomical features.\par \par \uc2 ''This is one of the first studies to build on these huge trees of bird evolutionary relationships, and to lay upon them the story of this key structure, the beak,'' said Bhart-Anjan Bhullar, an assistant professor of geology at Yale \b \highlight22\uc2 University\b0 \highlight\uc2  who did not participate in the research.\par \par \uc2 Like the Science Times page on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 . | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020170202ed220006m\par }\par }}
